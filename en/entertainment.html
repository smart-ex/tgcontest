The owner said he was a big 007 fan as a child and his brother-in-law, who was a driver for Aston Martin during the filming of Goldfinger, asked Pinewood Studios if they had any memorabilia. The studio gave him Oddjob’s bowler hat but removed the metal rim.
“As a young lad, everybody wanted to throw the Oddjob hat, and if you look at it, everybody did throw the hat because it’s absolutely in pieces because it didn’t have the steel in it anymore, so therefore whenever it landed it damaged it,” the owner said.
It was previously revealed that the hat appears on the BBC One show, leaving Antiques Roadshow expert Marc Allum “shaking with anticipation and excitement”.
The Bond item was part of a collection of 007 memorabilia brought to Antiques Roadshow when it filmed at the National Botanic Garden of Wales last summer.

A signed clapperboard for the new James Bond film went under the hammer in April.
The piece of No Time To Die memorabilia – which was signed by stars including Daniel Craig, Naomie Harris, Lea Seydoux, Lashana Lynch and Ana De Armas – raised £13,000 for the NHS.
The item was one of 61 lots sold by the Bonhams auction house in aid of the NHS Charities Covid-19 Urgent Appeal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bond villain's hat goes up for auction on Antiques Roadshow for thousands</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Oddjob’s deadly bowler hat in the 007 film ­Goldfinger has made a ­surprise appearance on the BBC’s Antiques Roadshow.
The battered steel-rimmed hat was one of those thrown by actor and Olympic weightlifter Harold Sakata in the 1964 film, and valued at up to £30,000.
It was part of a collection of James Bond memorabilia brought to the show when it filmed at the National Botanic Garden of Wales last summer.
The hat, together with a 007 number plate, left Roadshow expert Marc Allum amazed.
He called them an “iconic part of Bond history”, adding: “I’m shaking with excitement.”
The owner said he was a huge 007 fan as a child and his brother-in-law was a driver for Aston Martin during the filming of Goldfinger, starring Sean Connery as Bond and Gert Frobe as the baddie.
He asked for memorabilia and Pinewood Studios gave him Oddjob’s bowler hat but insisted the metal rim be taken out before it was handed over as it was too dangerous.
He said: “As a young lad, everybody wanted to throw the Oddjob hat, and if you look at it, everybody did throw the hat because it’s absolutely in pieces because it didn’t have the steel in it any more, so therefore whenever it landed it damaged it.”
Despite the damage, Marc valued the flat-crowned bowler at £20,000 to £30,000 and the 007 number plate, which was used by Aston Martin to promote the film but never appeared on screen, at £4,000 to £6,000.
The owner of the collection said they would be stowed away, but he would be interested in selling them.
Over the years, Antiques Roadshow has valued several James Bond items including a jacket worn by Daniel Craig in Casino Royale at £3,000-£5,000 and a watch used in The World is Not Enough valued at £15,000-£20,000.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Antiques Roadshow sees James Bond hat valued at £30k</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Antiques Roadshow shocked tonight as a James Bond bowler hat struck gold for a 007 fan with an impressive £30k valuation.
The battered accessory, which used to deadly effect by infamous hitman Oddjob (played by Harold Sakata) in the 1964 film Goldfinger, was part of a collection of James Bond memorabilia brought to the show when it filmed at the National Botanic Garden of Wales last summer.
Expert Marc Allum was seriously impressed by the treasures – including a number plate – and branded them as an ‘iconic part of Bond history.’
Looking at the items, Allum enthused: ‘I’m shaking with anticipation and excitement. This, I think, is an amazingly iconic collection of objects and an amazing story too.’
The owner admitted he was a huge fan of the franchise as a child and his brother-in-law, who was a driver for Aston Martin during the filming of Goldfinger, asked Pinewood Studios if they had any memorabilia.
The studio gave him Oddjob’s bowler hat but insisted the metal rim was taken out before it was handed over – with disastrous consequences.
‘As a young lad, everybody wanted to throw the Oddjob hat, and if you look at it, everybody did throw the hat because it’s absolutely in pieces because it didn’t have the steel in it anymore, so therefore whenever it landed it damaged it,’ they said.
Despite the damage, Marc valued the bowler hat between £20k-30k and the 007 number plate, which was used by Aston Martin to promote the film but never appeared on screen, at £4-6k.
Although the owner of the collection said the items would be safely stowed away, he did express an interest in selling them.
Over the years Antiques Roadshow has valued several James Bond items including a jacket worn by Daniel Craig in Casino Royale valued at £3-5k, a watch used in The World is Not Enough valued at £15-20k, and a first edition of The Man With The Golden Gun valued at £1.2-£1.5k.
Antiques Roadshow airs tonight at 7.15pm on BBC One.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTubers Trick Carole Baskin Into Thinking She Was Being Interviewed For ‘The Tonight Show’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Netflix’s Tiger King blew up in March, the show’s stars scrambled to give interviews with anyone who’d listen. All except Carole Baskin.
Now she’s given her first public interview since the docuseries aired, and it was all because two YouTubers pranked her into thinking they were producers for The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
Josh Pieters and Archie Manners came up with a plan to download clips from actual Jimmy Fallon interviews and put them into a soundboard on their iPad. They then reached out for a chat.
“She said no, because the Tiger Queen hates Tiger King for making suggestions she was involved in her husband’s disappearance,” Pieters said.
“So we emailed her again saying we wouldn’t talk about Tiger King, which was fine for us because we couldn’t make Jimmy Fallon talk about Tiger King.
“We said we’d just talk about cats.”
It turns out Fallon has interviewed Kat Dennings, the stars of the movie Cats, and Bob Irwin holding a cat, all of which were very useful as soundbite fodder.
While there was nothing groundbreaking in the interview, we did learn a few tidbits about how Big Cat Rescue is coping during the pandemic.
“We have so many cats depending on us, we don’t have a choice in the situation,” Baskin said.
She said they’ve stockpiled around 9,000 kilos of frozen meat and still have volunteers on hand to look after the animals every day.
“After COVID-19 I just don’t know if we’re ever going to be able to do tours again,” she added.
The fact this stunt was pulled off so smoothly shouldn’t come as a surprise – these are the same guys who literally flew professional racist Katie Hopkins to Prague as part of an elaborate prank to get her to pose in front of a sign reading C. U. N. T.
The boys have form.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger King’s Carole Baskin tricked into giving first interview by pranksters posing as Jimmy Fallon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TIGER King's Carole Baskin's first interview since the popular show came out on Netflix in March premiered Sunday.
The big cat activist thought she was exclusively talking to Jimmy Fallon when she was really talking to two YouTube pranksters.
Josh Pieters and Archie Manners wanted to see if they could trick celebrities into giving them interviews.
They do this by telling victims that they would be talking to a late-night show host, like James Corden or Jimmy Fallon.
From this they were able to score an exclusive chat with Baskin by pretending to be Jimmy Fallon.
In the fake interview, Carole revealed she “had to let go about half of our staff” because her sanctuary’s been closed amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Though she said she and handful of volunteers are working “double-time” to care for the haven’s 55 exotic cats, she confessed she doesn’t know if they’ll “ever going to be able to do tours again.”
Carole, who told Us Weekly she “isn’t angry” about the “fun prank,” was also persuaded to wear her flower crown while showing pictures of herself and her third husband, Howard Baskin.
She told the outlet: “I was suspicious as we were doing it because the questions appeared taped, but had no idea it would turn out to be such a fun prank.
“It gave us a very welcome good laugh. I appreciate their cleverness and that they created their video in a way that I don’t feel was in any way mean-spirited.”
She used the interview with the YouTubers as an opportunity to talk about a proposed law aimed at stopping the exploitation and abuse of big cats in zoos.
Josh talked to INSIDER about why he chose Carole and how he was able to get her to agree to a fake interview.
He explained: "Here's a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show.
"And we thought, why don't we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?"
He then explained that they used a fake email address to reach Carole and tell her they were producing live segments for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.
Ultimately, she agreed to the interview.
They then went through thousands of Jimmy Fallon clips where he uses the word "cat" and pieced them all together to make Carole believe she was actually talking to the late-night show host.
Josh explained: "As you'll see in the video, Jimmy Fallon has interviewed people named Cat, he's interviewed the cast of 'Cats,' and he's actually interviewed a real cat.
"So we had quite a lot of options for using the word cat. We tried our best to make it work with that."
Of course, the way the two YouTubers landed the interview may seem a little shady and may have people wondering whether it's illegal or not.
The 26-year-old had previously explained their methodology in another interview: "I think we always we always try to, not only from a creative point of view, but also from a slightly moral point of view, not completely dupe someone by breaking the law or doing something really wrong," Pieters said in a previous interview.
"We always try to give people a bit of a chance."
The interviewer admitted that they weren't really expecting it to work.
He said: "Like all of our ideas, we really didn't expect it to work, and then it did work," he said. "I guess it's that trying to run an experiment and see if it works with not much hope of it working," he said. "And then when it does work, it's always quite fun to watch."
Baskin is a "very interesting lady," Pieters said, and is excited to share the interview with the world.
"We really did not expect it to work," he said. "We still can't really believe we managed to interview Carole Baskin."
As most people know, Carole is one of the main characters in the docuseries Tiger King.
She was Joe Exotic's enemy and spent years trying to shut down his zoo and cub petting operation.
It was the Tiger King himself who first alleged that Carole murdered her first husband, Don Lewis.
Carole, never officially a suspect, has vehemently protested her innocence over “lies and innuendos” in the Netflix series.
The animal activist simply claimed that he had disappeared and made for dead, but new evidence shows he was actually murdered.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTubers trick Carole Baskin into first interview since Tiger King</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YouTubers Josh Pieters and Archie Manners tricked Carole Baskin into giving her first interview since Tiger King after they convinced her that she was talking to Jimmy Fallon.
The pair reassured her that they would not talk about Netflix or Tiger King and she joked that she didn't want to be referred to as 'that b**** Carole Baskin'.
They tell her that she won't see the host as she speaks into the webcam while she even breaks out her signature "hey all you cool cats and kittens" phrase.
They used a soundboard with generic questions and quotes from Fallon.
Viewers were amazed that the pair managed to pull it off, as Baskin has shunned all media and interviews since the hit docuseries dropped on Netflix.
She was unhappy with how she was portrayed and the episode which focused on the disappearance of her ex-husband Don Lewis.
Baskin realised what had happened afterwards.
Commenting on the video, she wrote: "This is the email I sent to my husband and daughter after the interview: 'Well that was weird. I couldn't see Fallon during the interview, and when they had his voice on the questions they didn't sound like it was specific to the topic.
"'He'd just say things they could have recorded from any other interview; like - what are you doing during Quarantine?
"'At the end he said: 'Miss you buddy,' so that really didn't sound like it was live from him to me.
"'They did stick to the questions they gave us, so I just can't tell. This whole thing may have been a spoof and they said they won't broadcast till next week, and will let us know before they do, but I'm not holding my breath.'"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger King's Carole Baskin breaks silence and says sanctuary may be forced to close</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tiger King star Carole Baskin has revealed her business may be forced to close after the coronavirus pandemic as she broke her silence.
The cat sanctuary owner had refused to give interviews following the global success of the Netflix series after her rival Joe Exotic accused her of murdering her husband in the show, something she obviously denies.
But Carole was tricked into giving her first interview by YouTube star Archie Manners and his prankster pal Josh Pieters.
Archie convinced Carole that Jimmy Fallon wanted to interview her and used audio clips from old shows to construct questions so she'd believe she really was talking to the TV presenter.
She spoke about how the sanctuary is coping in the coronavirus lockdown, revealing she's had to sack half her staff and is having to work seven days a week.
Carole explained: "My daughter and I still come into the sanctuary every day because we have to take care of all the big cats here.
"Unfortunately due to the loss of tourism revenue we've had to let go of about half of our staff and thankfully all of our animal care is done by volunteers.
"The animals are still getting their daily care but it means all of us are having to work double time to make sure that happens."
She admitted that the coronavirus pandemic may mean they never open again.
Carole continue: "I work seven days a week but I'm a workaholic so I really love doing this work.
"After Covid-19 I just don't know if we're ever going to be able to do tours again."
Carole has avoided talking to the media since Tiger King debuted on Netflix as she slammed the show for delving into the theory that she murdered her husband.
To get her to agree to his interview, Archie posed as an employee from a production company and insisted that they would only ask her about cats.
They sent her a Zoom link and told her that Jimmy would be asking the questions over the phone so it wouldn't break their cover.
Carole hasn't responded to the prank yet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Carole Baskin Tricked Into Giving First Major TV Interview Since ‘Tiger King,’ Says ‘I Was Suspicious’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Kristine Lofgren
Carole Baskin gave her first major interview since the Netflix series “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness” hit televisions across the country. While the big cat advocate thought she was speaking with Jimmy Fallon, it turned out that she was actually chatting with two YouTubers who tricked her into spilling details about her experience filming the show.
As Business Insider reports, Josh Pieters and Archie Manners reached out to Baskin to see if they could trick her into appearing in their video. Pieters conducted the interview, while Manners acted as a producer. They played clips of old television episodes of Jimmy Fallon’s show, The Tonight Show.
With so many interviews taking place remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic, the two saw an opportunity to trick celebrities into conducting interviews.
“Here’s a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show,” Pieters said. “And we thought, why don’t we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?”
To their surprise, Baskins agreed. They compiled a bunch of clips of Fallon talking about cats in order to prepare for their interview.
Baskin opened up about the challenges they’ve been facing at her big cat rescue in Citrus Park, Florida. She told them that she has been forced to lay off half her staff since they can no longer allow people to visit the park. She also talked about her choice of headwear – a type of lei – and urged people not to pay to see tiger cubs.
Since the news of the fake interview hit the media outlets, Baskins opened up about being tricked into giving an interview.
“I was suspicious as we were doing it because the questions appeared taped. But had no idea it would turn out to be such a fun prank. It gave us a very welcome good laugh. I appreciate their cleverness and that they created their video in a way that I don’t feel was in any way mean-spirited,” she told Us Weekly magazine.
In the past, Baskins has said that she was upset with the way she was portrayed on the show, which spent an entire episode focused on the disappearance of her husband. She says that people who are focused on finding out what happened to her late husband missed the point.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Tiger King’ Star Carole Baskin Duped Into Interview By YouTubers Playing Clips Of Jimmy Fallon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Carole Baskin is the latest celeb to be hoaxed by YouTube tricksters Josh Pieters and Archie Manners.
The British duo recently tested a theory: would celebrities agree to an interview when played recorded soundbites of James Corden taken from “The Late Late Show”?
It worked like a charm, with the pair easily tricking U.K. pop star Craig David, TikTok performer Holly H, “Love Island” couple Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury, and magician Julius Dein into believing they were having conversations with the actual James Corden, when in reality they were playing clips from his talk show.
For their next stunt, the duo tried the same thing with Carole Baskin of “Tiger King” fame, using clips of Jimmy Fallon from “The Tonight Show”.
“Here’s a chance where we could perhaps interview some high-level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show,” Pieters told Insider. “And we thought, why don’t we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?”
They decided to reach out to Baskin, never expecting she’d actually take them up on it — until she did. The result is Baskin’s first major interview since the debut of “Tiger King”.
“I think she did an interview for a local paper in Tampa where she’s from,” Pieters said. “But this was her first worldwide exclusive interview, which is just quite something.”
According to Pieters, celebrities are given a false sense of security when they hear the familiar voices such as Fallon and Corden.
“I think it’s also very hard when you are live on an interview with who you think is James Corden or Jimmy Fallon, to go, ‘Hold on a second, that’s not Jimmy Fallon,’ when it sounds like him,” Pieters explained. “You’d have to be pretty sure of yourself and pretty brave to stop the interview.”
According to Pieters, Baskin is a “very interesting lady,” although he admitted he never expected she’d actually go through with it.
“We really did not expect it to work,” he said. “We still can’t really believe we managed to interview Carole Baskin.”
The video of the interview is scheduled to go live on their YouTube channel at 3 p.m. ET/noon PT.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Tiger King's' Carole Baskin Tricked Into Fake 'Tonight Show' Interview by YouTubers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Carole Baskin, who was featured in Netflix's popular Tiger King docu-series, has given few interviews since the show became a hit, citing her displeasure with the way the show portrayed her.  But she recently fell victim to a prank by YouTubers pretending to be Jimmy Fallon interviewing her for The Tonight Show.
Pranksters Josh Pieters and Archie Manners posted a video Sunday on their YouTube channel showing how they pranked Baskin. The duo pulled clips of Fallon asking various questions about cats that would not cause suspicion on Baskin's part.
"Here's a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show. And we thought, why don't we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?" Pieters told Insider, adding it took multiple attempts to finally get Baskin on board.
Baskin has previously said she doesn't like how Tiger King implied that she had a hand in her late husband's death. However, Pieters and Manners convinced her that "Jimmy Fallon" would ask only about her big cats.
They told her she wouldn't be able to see Fallon during the interview, being conducted via Zoom, and explained how they handled moments where they were stuck without an appropriate audio clip of Fallon's voice.
"There is often a moment where there isn't a clip that's suitable," Pieters told Insider. "But that's luckily where I have Archie on standby who can come in and act as the producer and say, 'Oh we've got a quick change there, Jimmy's just doing this,' or 'Jimmy's just doing his makeup,' and then it sort of explains why something sort of went wrong."
During the interview, Baskin talked about how she's been taking care of her animals amid the coronavirus pandemic, noting she'd had to lay off half her staff "due to the loss of tourism revenue" and that volunteers are still helping take care of the cats, and also asked viewers to support the Big Cat Public Safety Act, one of her most passionate causes, which she also spoke about  in the Netflix show. She also sent them several never-before-seen images.
On Sunday, Baskin toldUs Weekly that she wasn't upset by the prank and thought something was amiss during the interview.
"I was suspicious as we were doing it because the questions appeared taped. But had no idea it would turn out to be such a fun prank. It gave us a very welcome good laugh. I appreciate their cleverness and that they created their video in a way that I don’t feel was in any way mean-spirited," she said.
Pieters and Manners previously pranked British pop star Craig David, TikToker Holly H, Love Island couple Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury and magician Julius Dein by using voice clips from James Corden.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Do you think it’s a girl or boy?’ — BBNaija’s Mike expecting first child with wife</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mike Edwards, a former Big Brother Naija (BBNaija) housemate, and Perri Shakes Drayton, his wife, have announced that they are expecting their first child together.
The couple took to their different social media accounts to break the good news with their numerous fans on Sunday.
In his post, the reality TV star said they finally decided to make the pregnancy public after keeping it a secret for a long time.
“Great news we can finally share our secret with you… We’re having a baby!!! Do you think it’s a girl or boy?,” he wrote on Instagram.
On her part, Drayton described the pregnancy as a blessing, adding that she can’t wait to become a mother of her man’s baby.
“Public announcement, been keeping a secret and I’m pleased to announce we’re having a baby. This is such a beautiful blessing. Me and Mike are excited and can’t wait to meet our offspring,” she wrote while flaunting her baby bump. 
The news of the pregnancy comes about the same time when the couple also launched ‘Mike and Perri‘, their joint YouTube channel.
Edwards, who is the CEO of Aireyys, a lifestyle brand centered around fashion and cigars, tied the knot with the British track and field athlete in 2018.
He had last year recounted his struggles to represent Nigeria at the 2018 Commonwealth games before rising to spotlight after emerging runner-up of the 2019 edition of the reality show.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTubers tricked Carole Baskin into giving her first major interview since 'Tiger King' by pretending to be Jimmy Fallon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Carole Baskin has given her first official interview since the binge-watching phenomenon “Tiger King” dropped on Netflix in March, and got everyone wondering whether she really did murder her husband and feed him to the big cats at her sanctuary.
But while she thought she was going to be chatting with late night host Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show,” she was actually being asked questions by Josh Pieters from his home in London, in his underwear, while his YouTube partner Archie Manners chaperoned the interview.
Pieters has been posting a three-part series since Friday on his YouTube channel, which has just changed its name to “Josh Pieters and Archie Manners.”
They wanted to know whether they could trick celebrities into thinking they were being interviewed on real late night TV shows by just using a Zoom call, some sound bites from old clips, and Manners pretending to be a producer.
Spoiler alert: they could.
When watching shows like “Good Morning Britain,” Pieters and Manners wondered whether the guests could always see who was interviewing them, Pieters told Insider in an exclusive interview.
“From there came the idea of just playing the talent recordings of their interviewers and seeing if they would notice,” Pieters said.
In the first two episodes, they spoke to UK pop star Craig David, TikToker Holly H,“Love Island” couple Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury, and magician Julius Dein with voice clips from James Corden. But they stepped things up a gear with the third video, which will air on Sunday night.
“Here’s a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show,” Pieters told Insider. “And we thought, why don’t we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?”
They sent Carole Baskin an email from their trusty fake-but-also-real production company Invisible Objects, saying they were producing the live segments for “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”
They’d almost forgotten about it when she finally replied and agreed to the call.
Pieters and Manners are a duo who have become well known and respected on YouTube for their social experiments. So far they have fooled the world with an Ed Sheeran lookalike, presented right-wing provocateur Katie Hopkins with a fake award, and sold microwave meals on Deliveroo, which earned them a reputation of having one of the “most underrated channels” on YouTube.
Even by their standards, faking the presence of James Corden and Jimmy Fallon sounds nearly impossible. The strange times we are living through certainly helped.
“I wouldn’t say it’s thanks to lockdown,” Pieters said. “It was just really interesting seeing people like Prince William and all these people you’d never imagined to see on Zoom, and Zoom becoming such a big thing.”
Video calls are being used by talk shows all over the world right now, and there’s no real set way to do them. So as long as Manners put on a confident enough performance, there’s no reason to doubt Fallon or Corden were listening in too.
“I think it’s also very hard when you are live on an interview with who you think is James Corden or Jimmy Fallon, to go, ‘Hold on a second, that’s not Jimmy Fallon,’ when it sounds like him,” Pieters told Insider.
“You’d have to be pretty sure of yourself and pretty brave to stop the interview.”
The interviews all went more smoothly than expected. Pieters said he’d been having nightmares of being really stuck and having nothing to say with the few clips in front of him, because it’s so hard imagining the direction the interview will go beforehand.
“There is often a moment where there isn’t a clip that’s suitable,” he said. “But that’s luckily where I have Archie on standby who can come in and act as the producer and say, ‘Oh we’ve got a quick change there, Jimmy’s just doing this,’ or ‘Jimmy’s just doing his makeup,’ and then it sort of explains why something sort of went wrong.”
The way they prepared for Baskin’s interview was by scouring Fallon’s older videos for relevant sound bites.
“As you’ll see in the video, Jimmy Fallon has interviewed people named Cat, he’s interviewed the cast of ‘Cats,’ and he’s actually interviewed a real cat,” Pieters said.
“So we had quite a lot of options for using the word cat. We tried our best to make it work with that.”
The end result was the first major interview Baskin has given since “Tiger King” aired.
“I think she did an interview for a local paper in Tampa where she’s from,” Pieters said. “But this was her first worldwide exclusive interview, which is just quite something.”
Pieters and Manners try to answer the “questions you didn’t know you had.”
They never try to completely trick anyone, because ultimately, lying and deceiving is a lot less interesting than what they actually pull off.
“I think we always we always try to, not only from a creative point of view, but also from a slightly moral point of view, not completely dupe someone by breaking the law or doing something really wrong,” Pieters said in a previous interview.
“We always try to give people a bit of a chance.”
Pieters said their latest series was simply seeing whether playing recordings to someone could convincingly pose as a real interview.
“Like all of our ideas, we really didn’t expect it to work, and then it did work,” he said. “I guess it’s that trying to run an experiment and see if it works with not much hope of it working,” he said. “And then when it does work, it’s always quite fun to watch.”
Baskin is a “very interesting lady,” Pieters said, and is excited to share the interview with the world.
“We really did not expect it to work,” he said. “We still can’t really believe we managed to interview Carole Baskin.”
The video will go live at around 3 p.m. ET.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTubers claim they tricked 'Tiger King' star Carole Baskin into first public interview since show's release</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two YouTubers have claimed they've tricked Carole Baskin, a star of Netflix's "Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness," into her first public interview since the show's release.
The pair of Internet personalities -- Archie Manners and Josh Pieters -- shared a video online, detailing how they managed to score interviews with Baskin and several other celebrities by posing as staffers from various popular late-night talk shows, such as "The Tonight Show."
'TIGER KING': CAROLE, HOWARD BASKIN SAY THEY FEEL 'BETRAYAL' FROM FILMMAKERS, ARE GETTING DEATH THREATS
The duo's video explained that they'd use audio clips from popular hosts such as Jimmy Fallon to trick stars into believing they were speaking with the famous comedians via audio.
In their video, Manners and Pieters revealed that they posed as producers of Fallon's show when they asked to interview the big-cat enthusiast.
[WARNING: The video below contains graphic language.]
Baskin initially turned down the request, Manners and Pieters said, but eventually accepted after they promised not to speak about "Tiger King," which they explained "was fine with us because we couldn't make Jimmy Fallon talk about 'Tiger King.'"
Manners and Pieters explained that they used clips of Fallon's interviews mentioning the word "cat," including interviews with Kat Dennings and cast members of the musical movie "Cats."
Baskin spoke with the duo over Zoom, and they explained to her that while she cannot see Fallon, he could hear her, she would hear him and he would be asking her questions.

The interview then began as the duo played an audio clip of Fallon greeting a guest.
"I'm doing great," Baskin said. "My daughter, Jamie, suggested that I do this interview with you, so she says 'Hi,' and we are working every day with the cats at the sanctuary."
The YouTubers played more clips of Fallon's voice, asking her who was quarantining with her, and what she's been doing.
"Unfortunately, due to the loss of tourism revenue, we had to let go about half of our staff, and thankfully, all of our animal care is done by volunteers," Baskin said. "So, the animals are still getting their daily care, but it means all of us are having to work double-time to make sure that all that happens."
Baskin further discussed life in quarantine while running the sanctuary.
"Thankfully, we were able to fill up our freezers, we can store about 20,000 pounds of food at a time," she said.
Baskin later added: "After COVID-19, I just don't know if we're ever going to be able to do tours again."

The YouTubers then convinced Baskin to don a flower crown and introduce several video clips while saying her catchphrase: "Hey all you cool cats and kittens, it's Carole at Big Cat Rescue."
The video contained a montage of pictures that Manners and Pieters claimed the public hadn't seen.
Fallon recently has been asking each of his guests if they'd like to spotlight a charity or cause during their remote appearances on his show, so the Internet personalities replayed a clip of the late-night host asking Baskin to do the same.
"There is something you can do to end the abuse of big cats and to save them in the wild," the activist said. "That's to make the 'call of the wild,' and you can do that by testing the words 'cats,' C-A-T-S, to the number 5-2-8-8-6."
Baskin continued, explaining that such a text message would alert a member of Congress and serve as support for the Big Cat Public Safety Act, a bill she's supported.
They then concluded the interview with a clip of Fallon thanking a guest for joining him.
"Tiger King" followed the rivalry between Baskin and fellow big cat enthusiast Joseph Maldonado-Passage -- better known as Joe Exotic -- and also examined rumors that Baskin was involved in the disappearance of her ex-husband.

Baskin and her husband, Howard, did previously speak to the Tampa Bay Times following the release of the series.
Reps for Baskin did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Someone else said: ‘Omg.. she was about to have a nervous breakdown over 5 seconds of having to wait,’ and a follower wrote: ‘She listened even though she was mad! she would have knocked the table down @pink_pineapples82 too cute lol.’
One other commenter posted this: ‘Reigny like we already on “corona lock-down” and now daddy telling me don’t touch my fruit snack this can’t be life.’
Reigny made headlines the other day when Toya shared a few new pics of her daughter, Reign, and said that she’s honoring the birthday of late Gianna Bryant.
Gianna passed away together with her father, Kobe Bryant earlier this year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Carole Baskin thought she was talking to Jimmy Fallon on Zoom. She was pranked.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Carole Baskin has been mostly quiet since the world became obsessed with Netflix's documentary series Tiger King. Now, the documentary subject has given the world a rare peek into her life in coronavirus quarantine, but she was tricked into doing so.
The Big Cat Rescue founder joined a Zoom call believing she was being interviewed by Jimmy Fallon to promote her animal sanctuary. Instead, she was talking to two YouTubers who had tricked her into thinking she was speaking with Fallon by posing as a casting company and playing sound bites of Fallon's voice. The YouTubers had clipped Fallon's soundbites from other videos. Fallon's continued to do The Tonight Show from home during quarantine, interviewing celebrities over video chat.
Josh Pieters and Archie Manners are the self-styled pranksters behind the fake Tonight Show interview. They've tricked other minor celebrities before by posing as talkshow bookers. But the Baskin interview is notable since she has been so private since Tiger King debuted. 
Baskin, whose shown as the nemesis of Tiger King's main subject, Joe Exotic, has criticized the show for her portrayal. The former zoo owner and tiger breeder is currently serving a prison term for hiring a hitman to kill Baskin. Baskin may run an animal sanctuary, but the documentary doesn't paint her as a saint. It airs concerns about her animal habitats and chronicles her ex-husband's disappearance in 1997. Local police never accused Baskin of wrongdoing, but her ex's family and friends suggest foul play (and that she fed him to her tigers). She denies it all.
Baskin tells the fake "casting company" she's doing the interview "for the cats," and uses it to promote the Big Cat Public Safety Act, potential legislation intended to stop the breeding of big cats in captivity. She only agreed to the interview if Tiger King and the ensuing controversy wouldn't be mentioned. She said her daughter her convinced her to talk to Fallon.
No one was physically hurt by this prank, but it's likely a blow to Baskin's ego. It's tempting to look at pranking for clicks as harmless, if groan-worthy. However, a hunger for YouTube views has put people in harm's way as YouTubers have undertaken more and more risky and morally questionable "pranks" to make videos all in the name of virality. 
Check out the video to see what Baskin and her cool cats and kittens have been up to in quarantine.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Peter Andre jokes Joe Exotic is Junior's dad after sharing embarrassing mullet shot</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Peter Andre refuses to let up when it comes to teasing son Junior about his hair.
Like all kids his age, the 14-year-old has to make sure his look is just right - and doesn't need his dad adding to the pressure.
But after saying the teen's new lockdown do made him look like US rapper Eminem when he shared a moody selfie on Instagram, Pete has gone in once more.
The singer is back again - and reminded the boy of when he looked a lot like a young Joe Exotic.
Pete returned to Insta late on Saturday night to wade in again.
Uploading a half-and-half shot of Junior when he was very little and the Jungle King, he captioned it: "Dad....is that you?"
Then he signed off the post with the hashtag #weneedtotalkaboutcarole - a reference to wacky Joe's obsession with tiger rival Carole Baskin.
Fans loved the sweet pic of Junior, who the star shares with former glamour model Katie Price.
"Some DNA testing is required here," said one in the comments.
Another wrote: "Pete Baskin has a ring to it - just saying!"
He has already been poking his son and on Saturday said his very short new cut made him look like Eminem.
Junior could be seen looking down at his phone as he posed in a bathroom wearing a dark blue Hugo Boss hoody.
In response Pete, 47, joked that his son looked like the rapper and tagged him in a hilarious comment.
He wrote: "Loved your last album @eminem"
He then continued to rib his son in the comments section, writing: "Can’t believe Eminem had someone break in his home do people have no respect don’t understand why people do things like this x"
Katie was overwhelmed after she saw children Princesss and Junior again after six weeks apart.
The brother and sister have been staying at Peter Sussex mansion during lockdown, along with step-mum Emily and their half siblings Amelia and Theo.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">"...He commanded so much respect and brought a lot of comic relief which came so naturally that he became hard to forget."This, is what Lydia Forson said about the late Bishop Bernard Nyarko. The veteran actor is reported to have died at the Ridge Hospital in Accra, yesterday, May 2, 2020, after a short illness.Against this backdrop, Ghanaians have been pouring in their tributes on social media to celebrate him.Joining her colleagues in the film industry to pay their tribute, Miss Lydia Forson, who explained that she only worked once with the late actor, confessed that he (Bernard Nyarko) commanded so much respect."I’ve only ever worked with him once and that was on Side Chic Gang before then I’d never met him. But he commanded so much respect and brought a lot of comic relief which came so naturally that he became hard to forget. In fact, every time I’d see him I remember the first thing I ever heard him say “this coat too is not nice, what joooon coat is this” (it sounded better coming from him)," she wrote on her Instagram page May 2, 2020.Miss Forson continued that, though he's no more, his memories will continue to live with Ghanaians, just because of the good work he did."Whenever one of us goes, it doesn’t matter if you knew or worked with them; there’s just a feeling like you’ve lost family regardless. RIP Benard Nyarko- you will live on through your work."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Britain’s Got Talent dancer (who was dressed as a crab) claims he is related to Ant McPartlin.
In a first-look from tonight’s BGT we see husband and wife Katherine and Joe O’Malley audition while dressed as Sebastian and Ariel from The Little Mermaid.
Although before the duo goes on stage to perform, they are greeted by hosts Ant and Declan Donnelly.
And it wasn’t long before Joe had something to say to Ant.
‘Can I say me and you are related – I am an O’Malley,’ Joe explained to Ant.
Ant replied: ‘So you watched the DNA show?’
And Dec couldn’t help but joke: ‘I thought I could see a resemblance.’
Now you say it Dec…so can we.
Kat and Joe first auditioned for the show in 2018, where they dressed as Beauty and the Beast, and in 2019 they brought Disney’s Frozen to the BGT stage.
And despite not getting through the first two times, the duo are hoping it will be third time lucky.
‘Simon is the one to win over, for some reason I don’t think he likes us,’ Katherine says in a first-look clip.
Taking to the stage dressed as our favourite characters, Katherine sang Part of your World and Under the Sea while, Joe narrated and danced (he even tap-danced) with his impressive moves.
Let’s hope it’s third time lucky guys!
Britain’s Got Talent continues on Saturday at 8pm on ITV.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Did Jill Scott, 48, date Drake, 33, back in the day? That’s the question that was on many fans’ minds after the singer admitted the rapper used to be “a wiggle in my giggle” in her latest congratulatory post to him, which she wrote in the caption for two pics she posted, including one of that showed the cover of one of his new releases and a throwback that showed them smiling and posing together. “Back when Drake was the wiggle in my giggle-white Lamborghini, Maserati @champagnepapi ❤️Respect and congratulations Doc,” the caption read.
It didn’t take long for fans to start speculating about what exactly Jill meant with her cheeky message and many of them seemed to think it mean the two had previously been more than friends. “Jill put that mic work on him😩,” one follower wrote while another wrote “😍 SUGA MAMA VIBES 🙌🏽.” “I’m just trying to figure out what’s going on in that statement 🤔,” another replied. “Yo wiggle to yo giggle what?” asked a fourth and another said “Drake definitely wanted her mic skills.”
Although Jill didn’t elaborate further on what exactly she meant with her caption, it’s clear to see that she’s super thrilled for the “Hotline Bling” crooner latest music release. The mixed tape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes, came out on May 1 and features some of his unreleased songs, songs from SoundCloud, and some new tracks. His next studio album, which he has yet to name, will be released later in the summer of 2020.
We’ll be on the lookout to see if Jill or Drake post anything else that may confirm what exactly she meant. In the meantime, we’ll just enjoy Drake’s new tunes!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man claims he married Priyanka Chopra before Nick Jonas</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A man claiming to be the first husband of Priyanka Chopra, the Bollywood beauty who went on to gain international fame, has crawled out of the woodwork….kind of.
You see it all began when model Chrissy Teigen, who also happens to be the wife of Grammy-winner John Legend, began a thread on Twitter, asking: “have you ever been famous but for like 1 minute? a talking head on an infomercial, in the background of a big movie? something u share with people at dinner parties but it's so stupid..I would like to see it (sic).”
Of all the responses that came forth, the one that has garnered the most attention is one by a man called Brandon Schuster, who recalled his meeting with Priyanka back in 2014. He had welcomed her to an event with a garland and somehow the reportage of the incident got mixed up. Soon, he was handing out ‘exclusive interviews’ to media, he said.
In his twitter post, Schuster explained: “I got “married” to Priyanka Chopra in 2014. I put two flower leis on her to welcome her to a “green carpet” event in Tampa. Little did I know that symbolized “marriage” in Indian culture. The Indian press had a field day with it and I was giving exclusive interviews the next day.”
The confusion draws from the fact that exchanging garlands is part of a Hindu wedding ceremony. Of course, without context, it means nothing.
Now that that’s sorted…Priyanka Chopra is actually married to Nick Jonas, of the Jonas Brothers band. The couple married in an elaborate series of ceremonies back in 2018.
These days the happy couple is self-isolating and Priyanka is getting her musician husband to give her piano lessons.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Comedy is dominating among movie and TV viewers as people look for laughs while social distancing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At-home audiences are looking for a good laugh as people practice social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The talent agency UTA's data group UTA IQ, along with the research firm SightX, conducted a representative survey of nearly 1,100 people across the US, ages 18 to 54, who had been social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak from April 4 to April 11.
The survey found that 51% of respondents were watching comedy TV shows during the outbreak, the leading genre.
Drama (39%), action/adventure (33%), and news (33%) followed among TV viewers. Family came in at 27%.
"A third of people still rely on TV to get their news, and family-friendly content is important with so many children home 24/7," the survey said. 
The popularity of family television is good for Disney Plus, which was the streaming service with the highest level of "intent to add" among survey respondents, at 37%, followed by the Disney-operated Hulu at 33% and the upcoming HBO Max at 31%.
HBO Max was the leading service among those that recently launched or are launching this year, such as the mobile-only Quibi and NBCUniversal's Peacock. 
The chart below breaks down each TV genre:
The comedy genre also dominated among movie viewers, with 59% of respondents saying they were consuming comedy movies while home. This it notable considering comedies have struggled in theaters in recent years while blockbuster superhero movies dominate the box office.
But only 24% of respondents said they were watching superhero/comic-book movies while social distancing, suggesting audiences prefer a spectacle on the big screen while comedies provide comfort at home.

The comedy genre also dominated among movie viewers, with 59% of respondents saying they were consuming comedy movies while home. This it notable considering comedies have struggled in theaters in recent years while blockbuster superhero movies dominate the box office.
But only 24% of respondents said they were watching superhero/comic-book movies while social distancing, suggesting audiences prefer a spectacle on the big screen while comedies provide comfort at home.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Comedy is dominating among movie and TV viewers as people look for laughs while social distancing, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At-home audiences are looking for a good laugh as people practice social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.
The talent agency UTA’s data group UTA IQ, along with the research firm SightX, conducted a representative survey of nearly 1,100 people across the US, ages 18 to 54, who had been social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak from April 4 to April 11.
The survey found that 51% of respondents were watching comedy TV shows during the outbreak, the leading genre.
Drama (39%), action/adventure (33%), and news (33%) followed among TV viewers. Family came in at 27%.
“A third of people still rely on TV to get their news, and family-friendly content is important with so many children home 24/7,” the survey said.
The popularity of family television is good for Disney Plus, which was the streaming service with the highest level of “intent to add” among survey respondents, at 37%, followed by the Disney-operated Hulu at 33% and the upcoming HBO Max at 31%.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What having Zoom prom is really like, according to 3 high schoolers who had their dances canceled due to the coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus is canceling plans, grounding planes, and closing schools, but some high schoolers are determined not to miss out on prom.
For people across the country, videoconferencing tool Zoom has emerged as a solution to singing and dancing with friends, and showing off a new outfit, while still maintaining social distancing guidance and preventing possible COVID-19 exposure.
The US now has the largest coronavirus outbreak of any country, and a third of the world is under some kind of lockdown. Once schools closed, high school juniors and seniors realized that they'd miss out on some big milestones they'd been looking forward to for the year, like prom and graduation. 
One group of students in Japan gained attention for hosting virtual graduation in Minecraft, but being able to see each other and socialize is key to the prom experience. 
Here's what it's like to have a Zoom prom, according to teens who did it. 
17-year-old Zain Gregg from Florida attended a Zoom prom for "theater kids" after his school's prom was cancelled, which he told Business Insider would have been a big deal for him and his friends. His friend Shelby and her parents threw a virtual Prom over Zoom, where friends could call in or get together from a safe distance outside. Their prom even had a photo booth for people to take pictures, while ensuring they maintained social distance.

Gregg told Business Insider that although it wasn't the typical prom experience, it was "a moment to feel like we were normal again." They chatted and played multiplayer games online, like Cards Against Humanity.
We "all had a chance to laugh again and see each other, even if it wasn't in person. We're like that one big annoying family that has so many different members," he said of his friend group.
Alyssa Calderon, a senior in high school, also attended a Zoom prom. Her prom was hosted by her school, though she told Business Insider that only about 80 people out of her 900-person class joined the call. Calderon said the best part of the event was being able to see her friends, but " the worst part was that we couldn't really dance and hang out with everyone like we used to. It really made me miss everyone."
The idea of a Zoom prom came up soon after the regular prom was cancelled, and seniors were sad about missing one of their final milestones. Still, the Zoom prom couldn't really compare to the real thing, which Calderon attended last year. "It was quite awkward at first and no one really knew how to break the ice" she said.
It got better, though; the host played music over her speakers so everyone could dance on their own, and later everyone sang karaoke, which Calderon said brought together members of the class who didn't ordinarily hang out together.
Rylee Jasnowski in Kansas went to a Zoom prom organized by her English teacher. This version of a virtual prom was about each student getting to show off their outfit and have their moment in the spotlight. "The best part actually getting dressed up and putting on my dress and seeing other people in their dresses" Jasnowski said, though it was somewhat of a disappointing replacement for a night of dancing with friends and a fancy dinner.
"My teacher gave everyone the spot light and we got to talk about and do a full view of our outfits," she told Business Insider. Instead of renting tuxes, some of the boys dressed up in cowboys hats or other costumes. Even girls who hadn't bought prom dresses came, with full hair and makeup.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Doting mum Katie Price has been reunited with the youngest of her brood.
Katie, 41, shared a series of clips of her and Bunny, five, spending Sunday together with drawing and nail painting.
Bunny and her brother Jett, six, have been spending lockdown with their dad Kieran, as Katie self-isolated with eldest lad Harvey.
"This is my picture for my mummy," Bunny tells the camera, "It's me, her and Blade."
Blade is Katie's beloved dog, but she was focused on another part of the drawing.
"So I've got no hair?" Katie laughed.
Bunny frowns, then leaves to make amendments to her drawing.
Another clip shows Bunny wearing fake nails.
"You've done that this morning all by yourself?" an impressed Katie asks, "They're just like mummy's!"
The star captioned the clip: "Sunday morning fun with my Bunny bops."
Later in her Instagram Stories, as Katie speaks to the camera, we see Jett cuddled up to her.
She recently opened up about what it was like to see Junior, 14, and Princess, 12, again after six weeks apart.
The pair, who she shares with Peter Andre, had been isolating at their dad's.
Katie, for one, couldn't believe how much the teens had changed.
"I can't believe how much the kids have grown in six weeks," she told The Sun, "Pete's had them sleeping in growing bags!
"I welled up, it's been a tough six weeks not being able to hug them."
Katie's ready for a one off special of her show Katie Price: My Crazy Life to air on Monday night.
In a preview clip, she dishes about her past and how she's ready to move on to a new chapter.
"Four weeks in hospital and some intensive therapy that will continue for the rest of my life," she said.
"I've been to hell and back and I'm starting to feel like me again."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lea Michele has confirmed, with a new Instagram post, that she is pregnant. The former Glee star made the announcement in the form of a photo of her wearing a blue floral maternity dress. The caption below the image of her cradling her stomach says, "So grateful."
Michele, who married businessman Zandy Reich in March 2019, is now expecting her first child. Rumors about her pregnancy were already circulating last Monday, when a source for Peoplereported that the couple was expecting. Neither People nor Michele have confirmed her due date.
"They've always wanted to be parents," the People source said.
Michele and Reich started dating in July 2017, and got engaged in April of 2018. They were married in Northern California, with more than 200 guests in attendance. Michele's Glee co-stars Darren Criss and Becca Tobin were there, as well as her Scream Queens co-star Emma Roberts.
"We are so excited to be married and grateful to be surrounded by our friends and family," the couple shared with People at the time. "And most of all, we’re so happy to spend the rest of our lives together."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Victoria Miller
The mom of three is all smiles as she gets some pool time with her toddler.
Jessica Simpson showed off her buff arms as she played in the pool with her baby, Birdie Mae Johnson, over the weekend.
In a new photo posted to her Instagram page, the 39-year-old singer and fashion designer is all smiles while cradling her 1-year-old daughter in the shallow end of the pool as she celebrates a free Saturday at home with her family.
The Open Book author has her hair pulled back into a ponytail as she wears a halter-style swimsuit and sunglasses in the black-and-white pic shared with her 5.3 million Instagram fans. Jessica’s toned arms, most likely the result of her workouts with her post-pregnancy trainer, Harley Pasternak, are in full view as she holds on to baby Birdie in the water.
While she’s obviously thrilled to have some mommy-daughter time, in the caption to the post, Jessica revealed the real reason for her happy face. The busy mom of three noted that she feels like a kid in school again with the weekend off. Like many other parents all across the country, Jessica and her husband Eric Johnson have been in homeschool mode with her older children, Maxwell Drew, 8, and Ace Knute, 6, due to the coronavirus pandemic. It’s no wonder the splash in the pool with her baby feels like a much-needed day off.
In comments to the post, fans and famous friends commiserated with Jessica regarding the school situation.
“Right!! I live for the weekends more than ever right now!” one fan wrote.
“Seriously weekends have taken on a whole new meaning now that we are homeschool moms,” another added.
Other fans zeroed in on Jessica’s fit physique as she poses with her daughter in the water.
“Looking buff girl on #nationalfitnessday,” one fan wrote.
“You look amazing! Look at those arms!” another added.
While homeschooling may be consuming much of her week, Jessica has definitely been getting her pool time in when she can. Last week she was nearly pelted with a baseball while sunning on a float in her pool. The former Newlyweds star shared a pic of the aftermath of her son Ace’s homeroom to her Instagram page, where the “splash” showed the baseball landed right next to her float, barely missing her.
Baby Birdie has also spent a lot of time in the water. The toddler has been pictured multiple times on Jessica’s social media page as she plays with her parents in the family’s gorgeous swimming pool.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Designer Dame Zandra Rhodes reveals she sleeps in her make-up and never leaves the house without it - and admits she doesn't have eyebrows after she 'plucked them all out' in the Sixties</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">She is as famous for her shocking pink bob and rainbow make-up as she is for dressing Princess Diana and a host of celebrities from Shirley Bassey to Nicole Richie.
Now Dame Zandra Rhodes, 79, from Kent, has revealed how she is maintaining her striking image during lockdown.
The fashion and textile designer, who is currently appearing in BBC1's The Real Marigold Hotel, said she never goes out out without a full face of make-up - and even keeps on when she goes to bed at night.
She told Susannah Constantine in the latest video episode of My Wardrobe Malfunction: 'I never ever go out without make-up.
'I sleep with my make up on, I wash it in the morning, and then I make myself up again in the morning.'
Speaking about her current look, she added: 'At the moment, I just have demure brown eyebrows,' while lifting up her fringe. 
'I don't have eyebrows because in the 1960s I plucked them all out.
'I first of all had little glitter dots, then when it was punk I had long and short eyebrows. I've done lines all round my eyes, eyelashes.
'It's been a bit too long like this but I have to think it out or wait until I do another wonderful picture with someone and then I'll rework it.'
With salons shut across the UK, Zandra has also been maintaining her bright pink hair herself while on lockdown.
She said: 'I dye it myself. It's bleached and then I dye it myself and, when it looks like I've got too much grey, I touch it up, because I haven't got a hairdresser to do that bit.
'She would have a heart attack because it really does need a neat trim. She has a heart attack when she sees how I've trimmed my fringe.
'I have a stash of Pinkissimo dye and I think I use cyclamen and Pinkissimo mixed together.
'I sleep in a very ugly plastic hat and pull it off in the morning. If the grey shows, I dab it on and hope it looks all right.' 
The designer, whose partner Salah Hassanein died last year, also revealed that even she has the occasional wardrobe malfunction.
'I had a really serious malfunction,' she laughed. 'I lived part of the time in San Diego when my partner, who had been the President of Warner Bros worldwide, decided to retire.
'I went to this very grand ball. It was when I was doing very exotic crinolines and the top was all woven in ribbons and there was a big crinoline skirt.
'No sooner had I nearly got up to dance, than the whole of the zip went all the way down the back. Luckily I had a magical shawl.
'But I then had to say, "We're going to have to leave this very early and walk out backwards," because there was no way I could even hold the bodice.
'It was already flapping at the front. I just had to say, "Walk out very closely behind me and we'll go out the side of the room".'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Celebs honour Gianna Bryant on would-be 14th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On Friday, Gianna Bryant would have turned 14, and mum Vanessa Bryant — plus a host of celebrities — took the chance to celebrate in a special way.
Vanessa posted an image to Instagram wearing a red bracelet that holds her daughter’s name and her nickname ‘mambacita’, with a heart in between.
“Gianna loved to wear a red bow in all of her school pictures. Red means love and life,” explained Vanessa in the caption. “To commemorate Gigi’s birthday today, please consider wearing red, caption an act of kindness or show how you will play Gigi’s way since she always gave everything she did her all and led with kindness.”
She hashtagged the post #PlayGigisWay, likely a reference to her late daughter’s affinity for basketball. Vanessa also said the bracelets would be available for sale soon, with proceeds going toward the Mamba and Mambacita foundation.
A host of celebrities took to Instagram wearing the bracelet and honouring Gianna, who died alongside her father and basketball icon Kobe Bryant, 41, in a helicopter accident in January.
Lakers star LeBron James led the wishes, posting a video of himself wearing the bracelet to his Instagram story, and writing: “Happy beauty-day niece Gigi!!”
Jennifer Lopez and fiance Alex ‘A-Rod’ Rodriguez took a family photo with their children, while all sporting the red bracelet.
“Happy Birthday, Gigi. We miss you. You are always in our hearts,” wrote the retired baseball player Rodriguez. “Today we wore these red bracelets in honour of you, to symbolise love and life. I think of you, Mambacita, and your dad everyday. We love you.”
Kim Kardashian West and sister Khloe Kardashian also posted tributes to their Instagram stories, wearing the bracelets.
“Happy birthday Gigi!!! We all love you so much!” wrote Khloe. “You always led with kindness and love. Today and everyday, thank you for inspiring us to be better.”
Kelly Clarkson joined in, sharing a personal memory.
“I remember Kobe telling me that Gigi always played with kindness, not just talent! I wear this bracelet to honour her on her birthday and remind everyone to continue her legacy and #PlayGigisWay,” wrote Clarkson, using the hashtag that Vanessa created for the occasion.
Ciara and her husband, football quarterback Russell Wilson, shared an image of their hands overlapping, while they both donned the red wristband.
“Happy Birthday Mambacita Gi Gi,” wrote the ‘1, 2 Step’ singer and dancer. “Today I’m going to do a little dance for you because I know you loved dancing. We love you.”
Actress Zendaya shared a wordless image of her wearing the bracelet, with an extra heart drawn on top.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'I am in awe': Karl and Jasmine Stefanovic welcome baby girl</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Karl Stefanovic and wife Jasmine have welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Harper May Stefanovic.
The Today host confirmed his happy news on Saturday morning, revealing Jasmine, 36, gave birth in Sydney on Friday.
"I am in awe. Harper is absolutely perfect," Stefanovic said in a statement to Nine. "Harper and Jasmine are doing well and dad had a great night’s sleep."
The Sydney Morning Herald understands the new 2.9-kilogram addition arrived via a planned Caesarean section at North Shore Private Hospital with the 45-year-old Stefanovic by his wife's side in the delivery suite.
Friend and fellow Nine employee Richard Wilkins also confirmed the exciting news on the Weekend Today Show.
"To Karl and Jas, you guys are going to love this special time in your life," Wilkins said on air.
The proud new parents shared a beautiful first photo of their daughter hours after her Friday arrival.
Sadly, friends and family close to the couple, including Karl's three older children aren't able to meet their new half-sibling due to the coronavirus and visitation restrictions at the hospital.
Jasmine's parents, Bob and Cheryl Yarbrough, are currently self-isolating in Sydney after arriving from their home in Ascot Hill, Brisbane. The first-time grandparents are understood to be overjoyed by Harper’s arrival and are staying in town to help care for the new baby.
The couple married in a lavish Mexican wedding in 2018 after they began dating in 2016. Karl shares three children – Jackson, 20, Ava, 15 and River, 12, with ex-wife Cassandra Thorburn.
Nine, publishers of this masthead, confirmed Today Extra presenter David Campbell will cover Karl’s presenting duties on Today to lap up time with his girls.

    <h5 class="mb-1">CONGRATULATIONS: Karl Stefanovic and Jasmine Yarbrough have welcomed their first child together.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Karl Stefanovic and wife Jasmine Yarbrough have welcomed their first child together, a baby girl.
The baby news was announced on Saturday morning on Weekend Today by Stefanovic’s close friend and colleague, entertainment reporter Richard Wilkins.
Their daughter was born at North Shore Private Hospital in Sydney on May 1, just after midday.
The couple has named their daughter Harper May Stefanovic, with the new arrival weighing in at 2.9kg.
“Harper and Jasmine are doing well and dad had a great night’s sleep. I am in awe. Harper is absolutely perfect,” Stefanovic told Today.
Karl Stefanovic announced his wife's pregnancy in December 2019, sharing a paparazzi photo of himself emerging from the ocean while holidaying in Byron Bay.
"After a great deal of speculation… the rumours are true," Karl wrote, alongside a baby emoji.
The Channel Nine presenter met shoe designer Yarbrough onboard a luxury cruise ship in Sydney in 2016, five months following Stefanovic's divorce from his wife of 21 years, Cassandra Thorburn.
Since then, they’ve fielded many scandals along the way, starting from when the couple was forced to go public with their relationship in 2017 when they were pictured in Bora Bora on James Packer’s yacht.
At the time, Karl’s detractors thought he had moved on from his marriage too quickly. Their relationship became the catalyst for an onslaught of media attention, intense scrutiny and the ruthless intrusion of their personal lives.
But despite it all, the couple remained strong and they married in a lavish three-day wedding ceremony in San Jòse del Cabo, Mexico, in December 2018.
One year later, in December of last year, Karl and Jasmine announced they were expecting their first child together, a baby girl.
In April, Karl Stefanovic spoke to Stellar about his marriage with Jasmine.
"She’s been through so much... It’s not her fault she fell in love with bugalugs, and the accusations were wrong about her stealing me from Cassandra. It’s rubbish and it’s hurtful.
Karl admitted the relentless public scrutiny led him to ask Jasmine if she was sure she wanted to be in a relationship with him.
"There were times when I asked, ‘Do you really want to do this?’" he explained to the publication.
"She’s just a beautiful, sweet woman from Queensland who runs a business and fell in love with me."
Stefanovic has three children from his previous marriage with Cassandra Thorburn: Jackson, 20, Ava, 15, and River, 13.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kim Kardashian and major celebrities celebrate Gigi Bryant’s 14th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kim Kardashian was among major celebrities who celebrated Gigi Bryant’s 14th birthday on Friday.
It’s been three months since the teenager tragically died alongside her father Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash in Calabasas in January.
To mark what would have been Gigi’s 14th birthday on Friday, a host of famous faces wore red bracelets, which were created by her mother Vanessa to support the Mamba and Mamacita Foundation.
Sharing a photo of the bracelet on Instagram, Vanessa told fans: “Gianna loved to wear a red bow in all of her school pictures. Red means love and life.”
“To commemorate Gigi’s birthday today, please consider wearing red, caption an act of kindness or show how you will play Gigi’s way since she always gave everything she did her all and led with kindness.”
Vanessa added: “We are in the process of making this bracelet available for proceeds to benefit our Mamba and Mambacita foundation. I will update you with a post when we have them available for purchase.”
Kim Kardashian shared a selfie of her wearing the bracelet on Instagram, and added the hashtag #playgigisway.
Jennifer Lopez and her fiancé Alex Rodriguez also paid tribute to Gigi by wearing the bracelets.
Posing alongside Jennifer’s kids Max and Emme, and his daughters Natasha and Ella, A-Rod wrote: “Happy birthday Gigi. We miss you. You are always in our hearts.”
“Today we wore these red bracelets in honor of you, to symbolize love and life. I think of you. Mambacita, and your dad everyday. We love you. #PlayGigisWay.”
Khloe Kardashian also shared a selfie of her wearing two red bracelets, and wrote: “Happy birthday Gigi. We all love you so much! #Playgigisway.”
“You always led with kindness and love. Today and everyday, thank you for inspiring us to be better.”
Celebrities got involved by wishing Gigi a happy birthday, after her mother Vanessa posted a heartbreaking tribute on Instagram.
Posting a photo of Gigi just months before her death, Vanessa wrote: “Happy 14th Birthday to my sweet baby girl, Gianna.”
“Mommy loves you more than I can ever show you. You are part of MY SOUL forever. I miss you so much everyday. I wish I could wake up and have you here with me. I miss your smile, your hugs and your giggles.”
“I miss EVERYTHING about YOU, Gigi. I LOVE YOU so much!!!!!” she added.
Gigi and Kobe were killed in a helicopter crash on January 26, alongside seven other victims.
They were on their way to the Mamba Academy in Thousand Oaks, California for basketball practice when the helicopter encountered thick fog and crashed.
Kobe and Gigi are survived by Vanessa, and Gigi’s siblings Natalie, 17, Bianka, 3, and seven-month-old Capri.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What a joyous moment! Lea Michele, 32, confirmed her pregnancy by posting her first ever baby bump photo on Instagram on Saturday, May 2. The former Glee star looked absolutely radiant as she held onto her growing belly in a gorgeous blue dress with her brown hair cascading down her backside while beaming from ear to ear as she looked down. “So grateful,” she wrote as the caption which left many of her celeb pals and friends in an emotional state. “Crying! Screaming!!! Love you!” her former Scream Queens costar Emma Roberts, 29, wrote in the comment section. Others who wished her well includes new mommy Maren Morris, 30, who just gave birth to her first child last month. 
Lea didn’t wait too long to confirm the happy news that she’s expecting her first child with husband Zandy Reich, 36, after word broke about it earlier this week. A source told People about her bun in the oven on Monday, April 27, while adding that the twosome, “always wanted to be parents.” Lea & Zandy got married on March 9, 2019, in Napa, California after almost 1 year of being engaged. It is the first child for both of them.
The Emmy-nominated star was smart enough to conceal her baby bump in a slew of IG pics posted over the past month or so. She wore a super baggy sweatshirt in a snap of her posing in front of a mirror in early April. Many of the other photos shared were either taken from the waist up (like one with Zandy and another with her mother) or appear to be throwback ones from a while ago.
She joins in on the celebrity baby boom that’s been happening while millions of us remain in self-quarantine. Other stars that are expecting include Ashlee Simpson and Evan Ross and Chris Pratt and Katherine Schwarzenegger. Katherine’s baby bump could be seen while riding her bike with her action movie star husband in Los Angeles on Saturday, April 25.

Lily followed the pink and red petals as they led her to a beautifully decorated room full of birthday gifts and flowers.
She let out an excited scream as her loved ones sang to her on her special day.
Alongside the Instagram clip, the mum-of-two also pointed out that she shared her birthday with a several other celebrities.
"Happy Birthday to Princess Charlotte, David Beckham, @rexkudo and Donatella Versace but mainly me," she wrote in her social media caption.
The musician has since been inundated with birthday wishes from her fans as she celebrated her birthday in lockdown.
Although today marked the main celebrations, it appears that Lily has been gearing up for her birthday and even received some early presents ahead of her big day.
Two days earlier, Lily posted a picture of an enormous bouquet of red roses that she had received as an early present.
The letter 'L' was spelled out in white roses as part of her personal gift.
Lily and David recently have sparked rumours of an engagement after the pop star was spotted wearing a ring in several social media pictures.
The lovebirds have been dating since January 2018 and are currently enjoying lockdown together.
Although the songstress set tongues wagging, neither her nor David have confirmed they are engaged.

Death is one of the most painful realities of life seeing as everybody will eventually die and nothing can be done to stop it.
When a loved one dies, the feeling of loss never really goes away and those they left behind have no choice but to hold on to them by keeping their memory alive.
Late legendary basketball player, Kobe Bryant’s wife, Vanessa, has taken to social media to remember her late daughter, Gianna ‘Gigi’, on what would have been her 14th birthday.
See lovely photos/video from Chioma’s 25th birthday
Gianna would have clocked a year older on May 1, 2020, if not for her untimely death alongside her father, Kobe Bryant, and others who were aboard a helicopter when it crashed in January 2020.
To mark the occasion of Gianna’s 14th birthday, Vanessa took to her Instagram page to pen down a heartfelt note.
Vanessa shared a sweet photo of her late daughter and accompanied it with a caption where she explained how much she misses her and how Gianna will be part of her soul forever.
She wrote: “Happy 14th Birthday to my sweet baby girl, Gianna. Mommy loves you more than I can ever show you. You are part of MY SOUL forever. I miss you so much everyday. I wish I could wake up and have you here with me. I miss your smile, your hugs and your giggles. I miss EVERYTHING about YOU, Gigi. I LOVE YOU so much!!!!!!!”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Steve Carell will return to TV comedy with “Space Force,” which debuts this month on Netflix. It’s among the most anticipated new shows of the month.
Every month, Business Insider runs down the five most anticipated new shows using data from television-tracking app TV Time, derived from its millions of users around the world who use the app to track and react to what they’re watching.
May also sees the premiere of DC’s “Stargirl,” which will stream on DC Universe and air on the CW network the next day, and TNT’s “Snowpiercer,” which is based on “Parasite” director Bong Joon-ho’s 2013 sci-fi thriller of the same name.
Below are the five most anticipated new shows of May:
Description: “From Greg Daniels (The Office, Parks and Recreation) comes Upload, a new sci-fi comedy. In the near future, people who are near death can be ‘uploaded’ into virtual reality environments. Cash-strapped Nora works customer service for the luxurious ‘Lakeview’ digital afterlife. When party-boy/coder Nathan’s car crashes, his girlfriend uploads him into Nora’s VR world.”
Description: “A four-star general begrudgingly teams up with an eccentric scientist to get the U.S. military’s newest agency – Space Force – ready for lift-off.”
Description: “In post-World War II Hollywood, an ambitious group of aspiring actors and filmmakers will do almost anything to make their showbiz dreams come true.”
Description: “Set more than seven years after the world has become a frozen wasteland, Snowpiercer centers on the remnants of humanity who inhabit a perpetually moving train, with 1001 cars, that circles the globe. Class warfare, social injustice and the politics of survival play out in this riveting television adaptation based on the critically acclaimed graphic novel series and film of the same name.”
Description: “DC’s Stargirl follows high school sophomore Courtney Whitmore as she inspires an unlikely group of young heroes to stop the villains of the past. This new drama reimagines DC’s Stargirl and the very first superhero team, the Justice Society of America, in an unpredictable series. “

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amy Childs shares emotional love letter to new man Tim as she posts shot of him for the first time</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">REALITY TV star Amy Childs has confirmed she’s officially loved-up with new man Tim after she posted an emotional love letter to the hunk.
It’s the first time she has shared a photo of them together, and indeed him, after months of keeping quiet on her love life.
However it seems like Amy, 29, is very happy with her new man and couldn’t resist sharing a sweet tribute to him.
Posting a gorgeous snap of them on Instagram, the Essex star wrote: “When you finally meet the right one for you, it suddenly becomes clear why everyone else was so wrong .... ❤️ I love you”
Underneath the heartfelt declaration, boyfriend Tim replied: “Love you”.
Amy’s friends and followers were quick to heap praise on the couple, with Demi Sims writing: “So cute” and her cousin Harry Derbidge posting a series of love hearts in the comments.
Meanwhile one fan wrote: “You deserve so much happiness!!”
And a second added: “So happy for you hun xxxx”
While a third referenced her dating disaster on Celebs Go Dating, writing: “Jamie who…happy for you x”
Fans of the celebrity dating show were thrilled when it looked like Amy had met a keeper in hunky roofer Jamie, even going so far as meeting her family and children.
However, his true feelings came clear when he went on to snog another girl while on the freebie trip to the Dominican Republic.
Since the shambolic TV dating experience, she's been getting cosy with new man, Tim – and it’s clear she’s smitten.
Friends of the mum-of-two have said she’s "very excited" by her new flame.
An insider told New! magazine: "It's early days but Amy is very excited about Tim.
"We heard she went on a few dates with him last year but it wasn't the right time and it fizzled out.
"But they are back in touch and things are going really well."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kandi Burruss looks drop-dead gorgeous for the Virtual Reunion of RHOA, despite the fact that she’s not having her glam look to help her out. Her look was definitely a flawless one as you will see in the photo below.
‘I had to do my own glam for #RHOA reunion since we’re in quarantine. I miss my glam family… 😩 Doing my own hair & makeup was a struggle. I tried! I used @kandikoatedcosmetics on the beat! I love my fit from @albinadylaofficial .Make sure to watch the reunion May 10 on @bravotv!’ Kandi captioned her post.
Someone believes that ‘#kandi You look better when you do it yourself, chile!’ and one other fan praised Kandi, saying: ‘@kandi you still look the best at the reunion!!!’
Another commenter said: ‘For some reason, this all feels so phony!! No one keeps it real on this show and I use to be a true super fan!!’
One person responded with: ‘I agree I’m not a big fan like I use to be either. Her spirit is nasty. it’s probably with all that Mama Joyce drama was really bringing stuff out but I’m not feeling her this season.’
One follower praised Kandi’s look and told her: ‘You did a great job with your makeup 💄 you still slayed!! I’m rooting for you all the way. Love you @kandi 👸🏽♥️ Oh yea and FYI, please take my advice and keep Porsha at arm’s length. Look at her and Kenya. This entire season she’s been acting like she’s over the drama with @thekenyamoore and it seems like every time someone went against Kenya this season she was so anxious to be on the opposite end and go against her. It’s sad, I know reality tv is mostly drama but that doesn’t mean it should be fake af and not authentic.’
Another commenter made sure to praise Kandi as well, but not without throwing some shade for other RHOA ladies: ‘You did a great job unlike some that looked casket ready.’
Do you like Kandi’s look for the RHOA season 12 Virtual Reunion?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans know HyunA has an all-rounder, but can she add hairstylist to the list?
In the May 3 episode of her ongoing web reality series 'HyunA-ing,' HyunA gives fans an exclusive look at how she spends her time during social distancing - from reading a book at home, giving her dog an early morning walk, to spending some quality time with boyfriend Dawn.
At one point of the video, Dawn asks HyunA to give him a haircut. While she has cut her dog's hair before, she has yet to ever cut a human's hair; however, she accepts the challenge and meets Dawn in the bathroom. During the cut, they constantly tease each other over how the final product will come out, with HyunA nervously suggesting he "go to a hair shop and tell the hairdresser: 'Please finish this haircut.'"
In the end, while HyunA is proud of the work she has done, she admits that haircutting should be left to the professionals, adding, "The hairdressers know their stuff." However, Dawn is extremely pleased with his new hairstyle, which gives her confidence to try again later.
Check out the full episode of 'HyunA-ing' above!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reality TV favourite Amy Childs has gushed about her new romance with boyfriend Tim.
The former The Only Way Is Essex star, 29, has confirmed her new romantic relationship with businessman Tim.
Amy has taken to social media to praise her new partner and it seems she has finally found the right guy, despite her previous attempts for romance on Celebs Go Dating.
Sharing an adorable selfie of the glamorous pair on her Instagram, Amy had happy news for her followers.
She captioned the image: "When you finally meet the right one for you, it suddenly becomes clear why everyone else was so wrong...️"
Amy concluded with the simple message to Tim: "I love you."
The pair are currently in lockdown together at their home in Essex as the UK deals with social distancing measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
The pair have been rather quiet on their romance until now, but have been seen in images on Tim's Instagram page since last year.
Sharing an image of the couple in December, Tim captioned a glamorous picture of the pair: "With this little sort last night."
Back in February before the lockdown procedures kicked in, they enjoyed a weekend away together.
Showing an image from a romantic dinner table date, Tim wrote: "Perfect weekend away with the mrs."
To this Amy commented: "Perfect xxx".
Since the lockdown began in March, the couple has been at home with Amy's two children, three-year-old daughter Polly and 19-month-old son Rich.
Amy had Polly with her ex Bradley Wright, while Rich is the son of her ex, businessman Ritchie.
Despite having the children to look after, Amy and Tim are making the most of their time together.
Sharing an image of himself with a drink in a hot tub on Tim's Instagram account, he wrote: "Isolation isn't that bad after all! Quality time with my girl."
We're just glad to see things are looking so good for Amy in the romance stakes at last!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you’re looking for some serious recommendations to make your weekend worthwhile, Deepika Padukone has come to the rescue. The actress, who has been updating us with pictures of cooking and her daily chores, took to social media to recommend films to her fans. She posted pictures of two films on her story and suggested everyone watch it now. The first was Daniel Day Lewis’ Phantom Thread (2017), which tells the story of a celebrated costume designer. His life takes a turn when he falls in love with a waitress and makes her his muse. The other was Joaquin Phoenix’s Her (2013), a film about a lonely man, who falls in love with a AI virtual assistant in his phone.
Well, looks like Deepika is not just enjoying cooking and spending time with hubby Ranveer Singh but is indulging in some movie time as well.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Kim Brandow
Ivy Jane is seen helping her daddy brush his teeth.
Jessa Duggar took to her Instagram account recently to share a video of her husband, Ben Seewald, and their 11-month-old daughter, Ivy Jane. The Counting On star captured an adorable moment between the two that had her fans melting once again.
Ben is multitasking as he is seen holding the baby girl in his arms at the same time that he is busy brushing his teeth. Ivy is very interested in what her daddy is doing. She has her mouth open looking like she wants to do the same thing, She is attempting to put the other end of the toothbrush in her own mouth. The Duggar son-in-law finally gives in and lets her do it. They share the cutest father-daughter moment as they both grin at each other.
When Ben realizes that his daughter wasn’t about to let go, he guided his hand over hers and they both brushed his teeth together. Ivy thought that was pretty cool as she smiled big. It appears that they were either getting ready for the day or getting ready for bed. Ben is in a white t-shirt and sporting a bit of a beard once again. Ivy Jane is seen wearing pink pajamas with a rainbow and unicorn print.
Jessa Duggar was filming the whole thing and posted it on the social media platform. You could hear her talking softly in the background. She then walked into the bathroom, picked up Ivy’s little toothbrush, and began brushing her baby teeth. The little girl seemed to love it.
Duggar fans were so excited to see how big Ivy Jane is getting and watching her interact with Ben. The comments were all about how sweet she is.
“OMGGGGG Indeed the cutest‼️” one fan said.
“She’s so beautiful, she has the best eyes,” another follower mentioned.
“I cannot even wrap my head around how cute this is,” someone else said.
Jessa also loved seeing her two family members in such a sweet moment as she deemed it the “cutest” thing she has ever seen.
The 27-year-old reality star is no stranger to sharing her three kids with her 2.2 million Instagram followers. Just about a week ago, she posted a cute story of her eldest, Spurgeon, 4, wanting to add some salt to the eggs that she was making for breakfast. He assumed that the S on the salt shaker was meant for him. There certainly doesn’t seem to be any shortages of adorableness in the Seewald household.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Reportedly Agree to Tell-All Biography</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Forget about the adorable elephant documentary, this is the juicy stuff we’ve been waiting for. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, who are now more than a month into their unceremonious exit from the British royal family, have reportedly cooperated with journalists who penned a tell-all biography about their new life. Deadline reports that Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family, written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, secured an interview with the couple just before they left the United Kingdom for sunnier pastures in Canada (and now Los Angeles). The book, set for an August 20 release, is teased as going “beyond the headlines to reveal unknown details of Harry and Meghan’s life together,” in addition to getting participation “of those closest to the couple.” Our hearts say it’s a cooing baby Archie, but our minds say Meghan’s yogi momma.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Harry & Meghan Reportedly Agreed To Spicy Tell-All Bio & Somewhere, Lizzy Is Clenching</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, otherwise known as Harry and Meghan, have reportedly given their blessing to an upcoming royal biography about them. Deadline reports the couple even gave an interview to the book’s authors before they waved ta-ta to the UK.
Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of A Modern Royal Family was written by journalists Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, who have extensively covered the British Royal Family over the years.
“For the very first time, Finding Freedom goes beyond the headlines to reveal unknown details of Harry and Meghan’s life together, dispelling the many rumours and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond,” part of the synopsis on Amazon reads.
“With unique access and written with the participation of those closest to the couple, Finding Freedom is an honest, up-close, and disarming portrait of a confident, influential, and forward-thinking couple who are unafraid to break with tradition, determined to create a new path away from the spotlight, and dedicated to building a humanitarian legacy that will make a profound difference in the world.”
The biography will be released on August 11, you can suss out more details about it right here.
And then there’s the other book, the one called Kensington Palace: An Intimate Memoir From Queen Mary To Meghan Markle, which will be released in September. In an excerpt from the book published by the couple’s fave, the Daily Mail, anonymous sources told stories of Meghan’s behaviour in Kensington Palace. One source, a former servant, described an incident that contributed to the couple’s decision to split their household from William and Kate‘s. Apparently “Meghan shouted at a member of Kate’s staff”, which was “definitely the beginning of discussions about leaving Kensington Palace.” Other sources claimed Meghan was jealous of Kate, because “she is not married to the next king.” Bummer. The anonymous sources threw more of the same shit at Meghan, even adding that she was jealous that her former home, Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, was “tiny in comparison to the vast apartment complex where Kate and William live.”
In conclusion, it’s just another day on the royal beat.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Palace staffers called Meghan Markle demeaning names, reveals new book</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kensington Palace has long been the site of many royal tiffs and dramas with scores of royals having lived within its walls – from Princess Margaret to Diana and now Prince William and Kate Middleton.
Much of the drama doesn’t escape the ears of the people who have worked there as palace staffers. “You couldn’t hide anything from anyone,” one palace staffer told British author Tom Quinn, who reveals explosive details about life in the palace in his new book, Kensington Palace: An Intimate Memoir from Queen Mary to Meghan Markle.
Writing for Daily Mail, Quinn revealed snippets from his book – from Diana and her trysts to Princess Margaret and her many rows with her husband. According to insiders, drama followed the young occupants of Kensington again as Meghan Markle moved in.
According to Quinn, when Meghan first moved into Harry’s cottage in the Kensington Palace grounds, Kate had been welcoming and both couples had got on well. However, Meghan apparently shouted at Kate’s staff once and that was the final straw, revealed a servant.
“On the one hand she wants to be like Diana, a people’s princess, and on the other she wants people to stand to attention when she clicks her fingers,” said a former servant. Many of the palace staffers also believed that her dominance was obvious.
Harry reportedly told staff, “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.” Following this, staff, according to reliable reports, began using unflattering nicknames for her within weeks of her arrival which included ‘Me-Gain’, the ‘Duchess of Difficult’ and even ‘Di 2’ or ‘Di Lite’.
According to the book though, many of the palace staffer’s disdain wasn’t shared by the Queen who did not mind Meghan much.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex did not live at Kensington Palace for long though – the couple moved into Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.

It is at that point in her life where she tried to to take her own life, the show is set to claim.
The series will also reveal never-before-seen footage from Diana’s speeches in 1990-92. It will make difficult viewing for Prince William and Harry, 23 years on from their mother's death in Paris.
DSP, the TV company behind ITV’s Torvill and Dean, are behind the controversial project, according to The Sun.
It has not yet been officially commissioned by Netflix but filming is already said to have started, sources suggest.
Mirror Online have approached Netflix for comment.
And it will especially be a blow to Harry and his wife Meghan Markle, who are said to be in talks with the streaming giant over future projects.
Harry also worked with Netflix on a Thomas The Tank Engine 75th anniversary special shown only this week.
A TV source told The Sun: “The royals have all refused to take part as have the Spencer family (Diana’s family).
“William and Harry will be very upset and angry. It’s particularly distressing for Harry because he’s been working with Netflix.
"At a time when the royals have been dealt a blow with Harry and Meghan leaving, the timing is not good.”
Harry and Meghan are currently looking into new commercial projects as they settle down in Los Angeles, California after quitting as senior royals.
Meghan has already bagged herself a role narrating a Disney documentary, with the couple reportedly hiring an agent to bag them more big roles.
The couple and their baby son Archie are now living a financially independent life after their decisions to step down from the Royal Family means no more taxpayer funds or HRH titles.
Mirror Online has contacted Netflix for a comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princes William and Harry will be 'very upset and angry' over controversial new documentary series which is set to claim Princess Diana tried to kill herself four times</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princes William and Harry are set to be 'very upset and angry' over a controversial new documentary which will claim that Princess Diana tried to kill herself four times.
According to The Sun, a four-part series provisionally called 'Being Me: Diana' will delve into the mental torment the late royal suffered - from battling eating disorders to her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles and painful childhood.
It will use unseen footage from Diana's speeches filmed before the Princess of Wales' death in 1997, as well as interviews with people who were close to her to shed light on her inner turmoil shortly before her split from Charles in 1992.  
The series is being made by TV company DSP, which was behind 127 Hours and ITV's Torvill And Dean. The project is planned for Netflix but has not yet been commissioned. 
It's set to be particularly upsetting for Harry, who worked with the streaming service on a Thomas The Tank Engine 75th anniversary special after he and Meghan Markle stepped down as senior royals earlier this year. 
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are also believed to be in talks with Netflix about other future projects. 
A TV source told the publication that The Firm will refuse to take part in the documentary series, as will the Spencer family. 
'William and Harry will be very upset and angry', they added. 'It's particularly distressing for Harry because he's been working with Netflix.
'At a time when the royals have been dealt a blow with Harry and Meghan leaving, the timing is not good.'  
A spokeswoman for Endemol Shine, the parent company for DSP, told The Sun: 'This is a not a commissioned show and everything within the treatment is already in the public domain.'
Charles and Diana tied the knot at St Paul's Cathedral in front of 2,000 people on July 29, 1981.
In 1992, Prime Minster John Major announced the couple were to separate, but continue living together at Kensington Palace.
They divorced in 1996 and a year later Diana died in a car crash in Paris. In 2005 Prince Charles married Camilla Parker Bowles at Windsor Guildhall.
In video footage released late last month, the Duke of Sussex introduced a new program for Netflix called 'Thomas and Friends: The Royal Engine', which features his father and grandmother, Prince Charles and the Queen, as animated characters.
A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman confirmed the project had been in the pipeline for a 'long time' and added that 'everybody was aware' of it before it aired, including the Queen.  
The episode was recorded before Harry and wife Meghan quit as senior royals and moved to America. 
Proceeds from the anniversary edition, which aired in the US one day before the UK, are being donated to environment and sustainability projects under Harry's Travalyst project. 
In his introduction, Prince Harry is seen sitting in an armchair, reading from a book about the train's adventures. 
The 35-year-old, who is now living in Los Angeles, said: 'Thomas the Tank Engine has been a comforting, familiar face to so many families over the last 75 years - entertaining, educating and inspiring children on important issues through exciting stories and characters.
'I certainly have fond memories of growing up with Thomas & Friends and being transported to new places through his adventures.
'I am very proud to have been asked to take part in this special episode. I wish Thomas and Friends a very happy anniversary.' 
Meghan has carried out similar work in the wake of seeking financial independence and moving to the US, narrating the Disney+ documentary Elephant which started streaming on April 3, three days after she and Harry officially quit royal life. She too donated proceeds from the project to charity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Normal People star hits back at criticism of the show’s controversial sex scenes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NORMAL People star Paul Mescal, who plays Connell in the hit BBC drama, has hit back at those criticising the show’s controversial sex scenes.
The 12-part series has been dubbed the “horniest show on TV” and been praised by many for its representation of sexual consent.
However the raunchy scenes have proved a particularly contentious talking point in Ireland, where the series is set.
Listeners to RTÉ Radio 1 Liveline show likened the scenes to “something you would expect to see in a porno movie” but Paul Mescal, who plays lead role Connell, has hit back revealing he’s "incredibly proud" of the love scenes.
Speaking on the RTE One’s The Late Late Show, he said: “I actually listened in [to Liveline] yesterday, and I suppose I was a bit surprised, but the last thing I want to do is sit and judge people for that, because they’re entitled to their opinion.
“My own perspective of it is we worked hard to make it feel like it was a real, accurate and truthful representation of sex amongst young people.
“It’s something I’m incredibly proud of and incredibly proud to see on Irish screens, personally.”
Normal People is a TV adaptation of Sally Rooney’s best-selling novel of the same name, whichcentres around two Irish teenagers from different backgrounds who fall in love.
Set in County Sligo, Ireland, Normal People follows the couple through their highs and lows and touches on the power and vulnerability of first love.
Paul, 24, plays Connell, Daisy Edgar-Jones, 21, plays Marianne. The duos performances have won them rave reviews and become an overnight sensation.
Normal People is available to stream now on BBC iPlayer. Weekly double episodes air Mondays on BBC One from 9pm.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Normal People actress Daisy Edgar-Jones says she's proud of the way the show portrays consent - but a sexpert slams its 'very unhealthy' BDSM sex scenes which left her 'wincing'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A sexpert has slammed controversial sex scenes in the BBC drama Normal People, claiming they left her 'wincing' - while actress Daisy Edgar-Jones says she's 'proud' of the show's portrayal of consent.
All 12 episodes of the series were released on BBC iPlayer last week and fans have rushed to praise the adaptation of the hit Sally Rooney novel, saying sex scenes between Connell, played by Paul Mescal, and Daisy's character Marianne should be taught in schools as an example of consent. 
Speaking to Evanna Lynch and Riyadh Khalaf on the BBC's Obsessed With... podcast Daisy, 21, said seeing communicative consensual sex on TV shouldn't be 'novel'.
She said: 'One of the things I think is really brilliantly done in the series and one of the things very I'm proud to be a part of is the depiction of Marianne's first time with Connell.'
The series has been lauded by fans for it's realistic bedroom scenes, but sex expert Alix Fox slammed some of the storylines, particularly its exploration of BDSM, as 'unhealthy'. 
While viewers have already labelled the series 'perfect' and praised the show for 'capturing the atmosphere of the book', sexpert Alix said she found some of the show's sex scenes 'ominous'. 
Speaking on the same podcast, Alix said: 'I can't say I giggled at a lot of the sex in this show, a lot of it had me wincing. There are some beautiful and tender moments but a lot of it is tinged with the sense it's about to be lost or there's a high stake of trepidation.'
Alix explained that the sex in the show was an important part of the storytelling, and not gratuitous, but said she found it frustrating that Marianne and Connell appeared to communicate so well in the bedroom, but struggled so much outside it.  
'The people might love each other but they don't love themselves,' she said. 
'What aggravated me, even thought it's important to the story, is that they had this loving communicative sex but they didn't communicate any further after sex.
'They don't move things forward, they come together, literally, and move apart in the same sequence, they both had to go through other things.'  
And while she said the sex scenes with Connell were the most communicative, Alix added there were 'ominous aspects'. 
She explained: 'Connell asks, "Does this hurt?" and she says, "Yes, it's nice." I find it poignant that one of her first sexual experience about pain.  
'More broadly women are expected to get sex to hurt, and I think although that's not the only influence on Marianne's sexuality, I think that may have fed into her expectation.'
She added in later scenes, where Marianne was seeing Jamie, the sex is 'very unhealthy' and not 'S&M' but instead abuse.  
'We know that Jamie is aggressive and not just in the bedroom, he's abusive through their entire relationship, it's something he likes, when she talks about it she says it's a thing she's doing, she never expresses excitement, it sounds like a chore.'
Meanwhile Daisy explained she was proud of the programme, saying: 'I just love the way that Connell asks and makes sure she's 100 per cent comfortable with everything. 
'When I grew up that kind of thing and sex as a topic was taboo but I feel we're in a different time now, and shows like Sex Education are helping us be able to openly and healthily about how to have sex in that way.
'I hope that younger people see that and that shouldn't be a novel thing, it should be the norm that someone makes sure you're safe and comfortable with everything. 
Daisy added that she got 'used to' being naked in the show, even though she was previously so conscious of her body that she would hide in female changing rooms.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Normal People's Paul Mescal brushes off sex scenes backlash in native Ireland</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Normal People star Paul Mescal has brushed off the controversy surrounding the series’ sex scenes in his native Ireland.
The 24-year-old, who plays Connell in the series, was interviewed on RTE One’s Late Late Show, where he admitted it had been ‘a very bizarre 72 hours’ after the show dropped.
An adaption of Sally Rooney’s best-selling novel, the show follows the complicated romantic lives of students Connell (Mescal) and Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones). The nature of the sex scenes included in the episode drew particular ire in Ireland, where the country’s Liveline radio show hosted a debate on the topic.
Speaking on the backlash, Mescal brushed off any criticism, saying peers had thanked him for the series for ‘portraying young people in a society that they recongnise.’
‘I actually listened in [to Liveline] yesterday,’ he said. ‘and I suppose I was a bit surprised, but the last thing I want to do is sit and judge people for that, because they’re entitled to their opinion.
‘My own perspective of it is we worked hard to make it feel like it was a real, accurate and truthful represention of sex amongst young people.
‘It’s something I’m incredibly proud of and incredibly proud to see on Irish screens, personally.’
We’ve already weighed in on this issue – arguing that just because Normal People shows teenagers having healthy, consensual sex, it doesn’t mean it’s going to inspire them to have the sex they were probably already having anyway.
Paul’s co-star Daisy hasn’t weighed in on the controversy, but she did yesterday post a host of excellent behind-the-scenes snaps taken as the drama was being filmed.
Brb, just stalking her entire feed.
Daisy also previously shared some insider info into the auditioning process on the show – admitting that she had to ‘snog the air.’
Which, we’re sure looked totally fine.
Anyway, don’t mind us we’re just going to binge the entire, perfect series again and cry.
Normal People is available to stream now via BBC iPlayer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul Mescal gives his take on Normal People's sex scenes debate</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney's novel has been causing a stir among some viewers who have compared the sex scenes in episode two to something you'd see in a porno
Normal People's Paul Mescal who plays Connell in the BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney's novel has given his take on the sex scenes thus far.
The actor was interviewed on The Late Late Show last night via video link with Ryan Tubridy bringing up the widely talked about Liveline feature on Normal People.
As you are probably aware by now, some viewers phoned in to Joe Duffy to liken the sex scenes in episode two of the series to something you would see in a porno.
One caller named Mary said: "I imagined it would be something you'd expect to see in a porno movie. Certainly not for family viewing."
Another called Tommy added: "I feel it was a bit pornographic, maybe in one or two scenes. I feel that young actress is being exploited and used just to get the ratings.
"It's giving the wrong message to young people. I have two daughters and if they think that that's what's going on in secondary school, it's shocking."
Well, last night while chatting to Ryan, the Normal People star responded to how some viewers have reacted to the show's sex scenes.
Mescal said the sex scenes are something he is really proud of as they are something the team worked really hard on to portray an accurate representation of "sex amongst young people today".
He told Ryan: "The last thing I want to do is sit and judge people for that, because they're obviously entitled to their opinion.
"My own perspective is that we worked hard - myself, Lenny, Daisy and Hettie - we worked very hard to make it feel like it was a real, accurate and truthful representation of sex amongst young people today and it's actually something I'm incredibly proud of and something I'm really proud to see on Irish screens, personally."
Normal People tracks the on-off relationship between two youths, from attending the same school together in a small Sligo town to going to college and beyond.
It is a tale of modern love and how Marianne and Connell grapple with the challenges society throws at them during pivotal stages in their lives.
To catch up on the first two episodes of Normal People you can do so via the RTE Player. Don't forget to tune into RTE One next Tuesday for the third episode either.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why the conversation around Normal People's sex scenes shows how Ireland has changed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SALLY ROONEY’S SECOND novel Normal People became a bestseller after its release – and now the TV adaptation is making headlines across Ireland, Europe and the US.
While there have been articles dedicated to everything from whether the series will bring back the ‘jock’ to TV, to people’s obsession with the chain the character Connell wears, here in Ireland much focus has been put on the sex scenes in the series.
This week, an episode of Liveline on RTÉ Radio One was dedicated to the issue. But while some of the callers took issue with the frank depiction of sex between the two main characters, Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and Connell (Paul Mescal), what was notable was that the majority of the callers did not find fault with it.
The book and TV series depict the beginnings of a loving, consensual sexual relationship between Marianne and Connell (things get a little more complicated as the book progresses).
However, one complaint to LiveLine said that what was shown was “like something from a porno”. When asked by the show’s host Joe Duffy what could a person see in a ‘porno’, the caller replied that she didn’t know, as she’d never seen one.
Another caller criticised the TV show for depicting “fornication”. However, the majority of contributors praised Normal People for its depiction of consent between two teenagers as they begin to explore their sexual relationship.
RTÉ said that it had not received any formal complaints about the series so far, but had been contacted by members of the public about the episode’s content:
Call-in shows like Liveline might not always capture the full breadth of opinions on a topic, but they do shed light on how controversial a TV show or movie is.
That people are exercised enough to phone a radio station shows that there is definitely a level of disquiet there. But the reaction to Normal People also showed that attitudes towards sex and nudity on Irish TV have most certainly changed.
Donald Clarke, film critic with the Irish Times, told TheJournal.ie what happened in 1978, when a naked woman was shown on an episode of the RTÉ show Spike.
“It was fascinating – I was very young at the time but old enough to remember it all happening. Spike was a TV series set in a Dublin school – a rough kitchen sink drama – and it trundled along fine and got respectable reviews and viewership. Until there was an episode with David Kelly playing an art teacher. The crucial difficulty was he had a life class and brought in a nude woman,” said Clarke. “They didn’t show her fully frontally nude – she pressed her body to a frosted glass sheet through which she was viewed.”
That one scene became national news. “The show was taken off air and questions were asked in the Dáil. People were phoning up the radio stations furiously – but what was even then notable was this was not the first time there had been nudity on RTÉ,” said Clarke. There had already been films, like Billy Wilder’s Avanti, which showed some nudity on the station.
“But what disturbed people – and this brings us forward to the current kerfuffle – was it was an Irish girl who had done this,” pointed out Clarke. “And nobody really minded that much [about the other incidents], there were occasional complaints here and there, but it didn’t become a proper scandal until this happened.”
Another show that came under criticism – but for a different reason – was Executive Suite in 1976, a glossy soap opera which ran for one season. “Its only claim to fame was in Ireland there was an episode broadcast, which as I recall had a warning, that had an abortion in it. One of the characters had an abortion – it wasn’t shown. That was sufficient to have the series cancelled. That was enough in itself to have RTÉ take a deep breath and cancel the series. That wasn’t about decency, it was a political issue, an issue about approaching morality.”
But by the 1980s, things had started to change. “Like a lot of things in Ireland, the 60s didn’t happen until the 80s,” said Clarke. Things changed again after the millennium. 
One of the most important moves was John Kelleher’s installation as Film Censor in 2003, succeeding Sheamus Smith. It wasn’t long before Kelleher’s appointment that Quentin Tarantino’s From Dusk Till Dawn and Oliver Stone’s Natural Born Killers fell foul of the censor and were banned from being shown in Ireland. 
A pivotal moment, said Clarke, was when Kelleher granted an 18 certificate to Michael Winterbottom’s film Nine Songs, which featured real sex in it, in 2004. Censorship in Ireland had reached a new age. 
“That was itself [important], but what was as important was that it wasn’t a huge sandal; it wasn’t on the front pages,” said Clarke – who, for the record, didn’t give the film a very good review, but not because of the sexual content. 
When Winterbottom appeared on the Late Late Show, the detractors in the audience who complained about the film “certainly seemed like the outsiders, whereas 20, 30 years previously they would not have been seen like that – it would have seemed like equal debate”, said Clarke.
Clarke saw a reflection of that in this week’s Liveline discussion. While Joe Duffy was as patient as ever, he wasn’t afraid of gently steering them away when the contributors were bringing up unrelated topics (like abortion), or pointing out fallacies in what they were saying. The complainants were also not in the majority. 
“That demonstrates what has changed so much since 1978, where in the Spike coverage there were very few people who were turning up on public media to make the case for it. It felt they were putting their head above the parapet if they did. Now people who have conservative attitudes, it does feel like they’re putting their head above the parapet,” said Clarke.
“It demonstrates a real shift in attitude.”
Consent
That shift in attitude is also demonstrated by the positive reaction to Rooney’s depiction of consensual sex.
The issue of consent is one that has been to the fore in the past few years, with some colleges introducing consent classes. So Normal People’s take on things was welcomed by Orla O’Connor, director of the National Women’s Council of Ireland, who told TheJournal.ie:
These sentiments were echoed by Noeline Blackwell of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, who said that they “would join in the general applause for the centrality of consent to the sex scenes”.
“We get asked a lot about how it’s possible to communicate consent without killing the joy – as if it wasn’t really possible,” she said.
“This adaptation is showing how it is possible to communicate about consent, how to check in with your partner. I find it striking that they approach their love and desire as equals – that’s why it looks so consensual.”
Dr Caroline West, a lecturer and writer on sexuality studies, said that the discussions around Normal People on social media “have been fascinating”.
“Many people have expressed a kind of shock in seeing sex depicted in such a gentle, consensual way,” she said. “However this shock isn’t surprising if we bear in mind that we are used to onscreen portrayals of sex that are divisive, such as in mainstream porn, or in Hollywood, which often does a poor job of including conversations about consent in sex scenes.”
For her, Normal People brings up more than just consent. “We have seen a discourse about kindness flourish in the past few months, and Normal People seems to tie into that,” she said.
“Good sex is sex that is consensual, respectful and mutually pleasurable. Kindness underlines these factors, and it feels like a relief to see this on our screens, especially when we need kindness in so many areas right now.”
Normal People continues on RTÉ One at 10.15pm on Tuesday 5 May. The show is also broadcast on BBC in the UK and Hulu in the USA.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Demi Lovato Goes Makeup-Free for Swimsuit Selfies</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Demi Lovato seems to be spending her weekend in one of the best ways possible — by hanging out poolside. On Saturday, the singer posted a couple of photos on Instagram in which she donned a makeup-free look whilst donning a swimsuit. And, of course, the snaps were nothing short of stunning.
In her caption, Lovato related that she learned how to use the self-timer feature in order to capture her selfies. She got to put her new skill to use as she posed in a crimson swimsuit for a couple of seriously stylish and beautiful snaps. The "Cool for the Summer" singer's post has already garnered plenty of reactions from fans and friends alike. Model Ashley Graham even commented on the post to write, "my girl is straight fire," and she's definitely not wrong.
This isn't the first time that Lovato has chosen to go a makeup-free route on Instagram. In September 2019, the singer took things a step further by posting a completely unedited photo of herself wearing a bikini. At the time, she noted that she wanted to post the photo because she wants the new chapter in her life to be an authentic one.
"This is my biggest fear. A photo of me in a bikini unedited. And guess what, it’s CELLULIT!!!! I’m just literally sooooo tired of being ashamed of my body, editing it (yes the other bikini pics were edited - and I hate that I did that but it’s the truth) so that others think I’m THEIR idea of what beautiful is, but it’s just not me," she explained. "This is what I got. I want this new chapter in my life to be about being authentic to who I am rather than trying to meet someone else’s standards. So here’s me, unashamed, unafraid and proud to own a body that has fought through so much and will continue to amaze me when I hopefully give birth one day." As she continued on in her caption, she hoped that by posting the snap that she can inspire others to be authentically themselves, as well.
"Anyway, here’s me, RAW, REAL! And I love me," Lovato continued. "And you should love you too! Now back to the studio.. I’m working on an anthem.. also. Just so everyone’s clear.. I’m not stoked on my appearance BUT I am appreciative of it and sometimes that’s the best I can do. I hope to inspire someone to appreciate their body today too."

A post shared by Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) on May 2, 2020 at 6:43pm PDT
Demi Lovato is perfecting the art of self-timer photo shoots while social distancing, and her series of swimsuit snaps show just how good she's getting. The "I Love Me" singer recently shared pictures of herself wearing a romantic one-piece on Instagram, and it's more elegant than you'd expect from everyday swimwear.
The strapless ruched magenta suit is so chic it might cause you to do a double take. It certainly caught the attention of her pals, Ashley Graham and JoJo, along with her boyfriend, Max Ehrich, who responded with a heart-eyes emoji. I think Ashley put it best when she wrote, "My girl is straight fire 🔥" — Demi certainly is! Continue admiring her one-piece ahead, and shop similar swimsuit styles for yourself.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We aren’t complaining about Kiara Advani’s shimmery silver affair, a gorgeous photoshoot that she did for Hello Magazine before the lockdown. The pictures from the photoshoot were out and it’s hard not to crush on the gorgeous girl.
One phrase to describe her in the shimmery outfit is ‘drop-dead gorgeous’. The Manish Malhotra’s outfit teamed with alluring makeup by Lekha Gupta and hairstyling by stylist Amit Thakur took her gorgeous look to another level.
Not always, the outfit, makeup, jewellery and hairstyling go in perfect sync with each other and this photoshoot is one of those times when it seemed so. ‘Hello Magazine’ can’t ask for more from stunning Kiara Advani.

Berry wrote that she was enjoying some time for self-care during the coronavirus lockdown.
The picture has received more than 200,000 likes, and the actress's fans expressed their admiration with her natural beauty.
"Halle stopped aging around 25 years ago. I figure she must have stumbled onto the fountain of youth back then. Maybe she will tell the rest of us where it is," one follower wrote.
"Looking gorgeous!", "You are so beautiful, Halle", others said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kiara Advani has very successfully made her mark in Bollywood with her choices of films and performances. She is also quite active on social media where she commands a huge fan following. She is often seen sharing pictures and videos of herself with her followers and they just cannot have enough of the pretty actress. We recently got our hands on some sizzling throwback picture of Kiara from an old magazine photoshoot and it is sure to beat your lockdown blues.
Check out the photos here:In the pictures, Kiara is seen looking drop-dead gorgeous in a shimmery silver attire. Her coloured hair and matching accessories compliment her overall stunning look.

On the work front, she has some pretty interesting projects in her kitty which includes, ‘Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2’ where she will be seen sharing the screen space with none other than Kartik Aaryan. This will be the first time that Kartik and Kiara will be seen together on screen.

Apart from her work life, she is mostly hitting the headlines for her love affair with Sidharth Malhotra. Although they are yet to come out in open about it, their social media PDA, dinner dates and outings speak volume about their love affair.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Demi Lovato is taking advantage of the free time she has because of the quarantine orders to learn new skills including how to use the self timer on her phone and take steamy pool pics! She shared a couple of snaps on her Instagram and it’s safe to say that her boyfriend, Max Ehrich was impressed and so were her followers!
Demi looked stunning and sultry with no makeup on and wearing a strapless one piece swimsuit while she posed by the pool.
In the caption, she jokingly wrote: ‘Swipe to see how I discovered the self-timer feature for taking pics. @angelokritikos [her photographer] – you in trouble boo boo 😝🌴.’
The photographer was quick to respond, playing along: ‘BRING IT ON BOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 😍😍😍😍.’
In the meantime, her boyfriend also took to the comment section to show her some love by simply leaving a heart-eyes emoji!
Fellow celebs gushed over Demi as well, including Ashley Graham and JoJo.
Demi and her new man haven’t been together for very long but they already seem like they have a great bond.
One insider dished that they really love spending time together so the joint quarantine is no problem.
Speaking of relationships, during an interview on the I Weigh podcast with actress Jameela Jamil, Demi revealed that she is not in touch with any of her ex boyfriends.
‘I kind of used to have this mentality that if I had a negative experience with somebody, I needed to mend it or needed to make things right. The fact of the matter is that I’m not really friends with any of my exes because I had to realize that that was not healthy either.’
‘Now that I have been able to fully let go of people, that is another thing I had to learn when it comes to cutting the toxic people out of your life – if they are an ex, it is for a reason,’ she dished.

INTERNATIONAL JAZZ DAY LIVE STREAM ★★★★
April 30
Reviewed by JOHN SHAND
International Jazz Day (April 30) has celebrated jazz's role in helping unite people the world over since 2011. This year, when the host nation was to have been South Africa, it was, instead, another reminder of a community splintered into an epidemic of isolation. But, thanks to a commendable collaboration between the Sydney Improvised Music Association and Johnston St Jazz, a 140-minute mini-festival occurred via two livestreams and one pre-recorded concert.
If the bands chosen could have more thoroughly reflected the sheer diversity of what passes for jazz, they were all able to bridge the livestream remoteness. Over half the time was allotted to the final act, the Jeremy Rose Quartet, with Rose having become a composer of note, especially via his major work, Iron in the Blood, which was included in the distant memory that is this year's Sydney Festival.
Although Rose's work for his quartet stays much closer to the jazz mainstream than does Iron in the Blood, he still finds fresh compositional ideas with which to prod the idiom and to stimulate improvising options. In the piano solo on the meditative Religion, for instance, Steve Barry could deploy all his capacity to tease, suspend or subvert the listener's expectations. The dark, edgy and aptly named Precipice began with solo bass from Noel Mason, which beckoned Rose's bass clarinet, the instrument on which he has developed his most distinctive voice and widest palette of colours. On the brilliantly evocative Aktau, Mason's bass seemed to convey the enormity of Kazakhstan's White Mountains, Rose's tenor the altitude, Barry's piano the crystalline air, and Alex Hirlian's drums the excitement.
The Mezza/Ginsburg Ensemble, a collaboration co-led by Italian pianist Vittorio Mezza and Australian pianist Mark Ginsburg (with bassist Karl Dunnicliff and drummer Tim Firth) was filmed at last year's Sydney Con International Jazz Festival, and suddenly it was novel to see an audience on hand! Dunnicliff produced notably fine solos on two of Ginsburg's pieces: the gentle For You and Common Purpose, the latter made lush with the addition of a substantial choir.
Vocalist Kate Wadey, pianist Andrew Scott and bassist Sam Dobson opened the celebration and, while Wadey's breathy, unforced singing was especially effective on I've Got a Crush on You, with the piano dancing behind her, the rest of the performance proved more uneven.

    <h5 class="mb-1">There's nothing like a dame for easing the shutdown blues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Opera Australia has launched a free online streaming service featuring interviews and recordings of past productions, with a particular emphasis on the company’s vast collection of performances by the legendary Dame Joan Sutherland.
OATV launches today with a recording of 2012’s inaugural opera on Sydney Harbour performance of La Traviata plus a 1988 production of The Merry Widow with Sutherland as the eponymous Hanna Glawari.
Artistic director Lyndon Terracini said the project had been in the works for some time but that the virus-driven shutdown had accelerated development.
“Hopefully, people will feel it has a bit more substance than what you usually see online,” he said.
Terracini was personally devastated when the shutdown was announced.
"It was frankly extremely depressing,” he said. “I was a bit down for a few weeks and then I had to figure out what I was going to do so I started doing OATV and working on other projects to keep busy. If I’m not busy I get depressed and that's not good.”
Terracini said he felt for all the artists left high and dry by the crisis, particularly singers such as rising star Natalie Aroyan, who managed only two performances as Odabella in Verdi’s Attila and soprano Stacey Alleaume, who was to sing Violetta in La Traviata on the harbour stage this year.
But despite the uncertainly about when audiences will be allowed to return to the opera theatre, Terracini insisted Opera Australia continued to plan for the future.
"As far as we are concerned, we hope to be up and running before too long but having said that I think we all realise the world is going to be a very different place.”
He likened the current situation to that in 2009, when he first took the reins of OA in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
“The company was in a pretty terrible state and we had to do things differently,” he said. “I introduced Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour, the musicals and a different sort of repertoire. Last year and 2018 were unbelievably successful years for the company and were the culmination of 10 years’ work but now we will have to start again. That's all gone.
“It’s a depressing and daunting task but that's the way it is. It’s happened and we can’t do anything about that. We will just have to be more creative and think about who and what we are going to be from next year on.”
Terracini also dropped his strongest hint yet that this year’s much anticipated La Traviata, which was to have opened on the harbour on March 27, will be shifted to 2021.
“Let’s just say I wouldn’t want Stacey [Alleaume] or Con [director Constantine Costi] or any of the other artists who have worked so hard on Traviata for this year not to be given a chance to do it,” he said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Opera Australia has launched a free online streaming service featuring interviews and recordings of past productions, with a particular emphasis on the company’s vast collection of performances by the legendary Dame Joan Sutherland.
OATV launches today with a recording of 2012’s inaugural opera on Sydney Harbour performance of La Traviata plus a 1988 production of The Merry Widow with Sutherland as the eponymous Hanna Glawari.
Artistic director Lyndon Terracini said the project had been in the works for some time but that the virus-driven shutdown had accelerated development.
“Hopefully, people will feel it has a bit more substance than what you usually see online,” he said.
Terracini was personally devastated when the shutdown was announced.
"It was frankly extremely depressing,” he said. “I was a bit down for a few weeks and then I had to figure out what I was going to do so I started doing OATV and working on other projects to keep busy. If I’m not busy I get depressed and that's not good.”
Terracini said he felt for all the artists left high and dry by the crisis, particularly singers such as rising star Natalie Aroyan, who managed only two performances as Odabella in Verdi’s Attila and soprano Stacey Alleaume, who was to sing Violetta in La Traviata on the harbour stage this year.
But despite the uncertainly about when audiences will be allowed to return to the opera theatre, Terracini insisted Opera Australia continued to plan for the future.
"As far as we are concerned, we hope to be up and running before too long but having said that I think we all realise the world is going to be a very different place.”
He likened the current situation to that in 2009, when he first took the reins of OA in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
“The company was in a pretty terrible state and we had to do things differently,” he said. “I introduced Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour, the musicals and a different sort of repertoire. Last year and 2018 were unbelievably successful years for the company and were the culmination of 10 years’ work but now we will have to start again. That's all gone.
“It’s a depressing and daunting task but that's the way it is. It’s happened and we can’t do anything about that. We will just have to be more creative and think about who and what we are going to be from next year on.”
Terracini also dropped his strongest hint yet that this year’s much anticipated La Traviata, which was to have opened on the harbour on March 27, will be shifted to 2021.
“Let’s just say I wouldn’t want Stacey [Alleaume] or Con [director Constantine Costi] or any of the other artists who have worked so hard on Traviata for this year not to be given a chance to do it,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby quits TV role and issues poignant statement</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has quit Celebrity Juice, she has announced.
The mum-of-three has left her role on the ITV2 show after over a decade.
Holly, aged 39, had spent 12 years on the series.
She starred alongside the likes of Fearne Cotton and host Keith Lemon.
But pal Fearne quit in 2018 - and now Holly, who also serves as This Morning presenter, has joined her in departing.
On Instagram, Holly paid tribute to the show in a gushing post.
She wrote how she would miss “12 years of fantastic chaos," adding: “I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone.
“Thank you to you all for watching. We’ve always had the loudest and best audiences….
“It’s never felt like work and always been to me like a night out.
“Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work…  All good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever.
“It’s time for me to hand over my team captain seat to some lucky, lucky person.”
She said of Lemon: “I remember starting this journey with you and saying ‘I think this might work’. My goodness me it did.
“Three friends, you me and  Fearne Cotton … and that is what is at the heart of it, friendship. I love the bones of you Lemon!
“Thank you for making me laugh for 12 years… I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jimmy Fallon and His Wife Open Up About 5 Years of Infertility: "Gosh, That Was Just Crazy"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After an adorable introduction for the April 28 at-home edition of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, which featured the host's two daughters, Winnie and Franny, Jimmy and his wife, Nancy Juvonen, got candid about having those two very cute kids together. In the "Ask the Fallons" segment of the show (starting around 9:20 in the video above!), the couple were asked, "How did you know you were ready to have kids?"
"We were ready when we got married. . . . And you love kids and I love kids," Nancy said. "That was just the plan, it wasn't even [an], 'Are you ready?' It was just, 'Now how are we going to do this?'"
The couple have been open about their journey to parenthood, noting that they tried hard to start a family for about five years before turning to surrogacy to have both of their girls. "That was an interesting time," Jimmy said of the years they were trying to conceive. Nancy added: "So that was five years of really, really, really, really, really deciding not to give up, and at a certain point it just had to become almost like a job. Because it's way too emotional to live emotionally through that. So you just keep going and going and going and if you really want something you just make it happen. . . . I think if anyone's out there having the dream [to have kids], do not give up."
The couple also touched on the many times they received bad news throughout their journey. Nancy shared that when they got bad news they'd often go away for a weekend to regroup and be together. "We went away a lot," Jimmy said with a laugh. Nancy added, "Some times were easier than others. But then we'd just get right back up."
The couple went on to joke a bit about the hoops they had to jump through while trying to conceive. "I had magnets in my underwear," Jimmy said before noting that inevitably having kids through surrogacy is "the best move we ever made" and that they're "so lucky" to have their two beautiful girls who are "the best things ever." Our hearts!
Watch the entire video above, especially if you want to hear what they have to say about taking parenting advice!

“Three friends, you me and  Fearne Cotton … and that is what is at the heart of it, friendship. I love the bones of you Lemon!
“Thank you for making me laugh for 12 years… I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check.”
Lemon – real name Leigh Francis – wrote on Twitter: “I’ve had a lovely time working with you. You are the best! I hope I’m lucky enough to work with you again one day.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby confirms she's leaving Celebrity Juice in moving tribute</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has confirmed the news we have been dreading, that she’s leaving Celebrity Juice after 12 years.
The 39-year-old currently appears as a team captain on the show, alongside host Keith Lemon and fellow captain Mel B.
And despite rumours circulating that she had quit, the ITV host has now confirmed the sad news on Instagram with a lengthy post.
Sharing a series of photos of her time on the show fronted by funnyman Keith, Holly began: ‘Thank you Celebrity Juice for 12 years of fantastic chaos… I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone. Thank you to you all for watching..we’ve always had the loudest and best audiences.
‘Also a huge thank you to ITV2 for believing in the show in the first place and for all of your support…Over the years the production team has changed, however to anyone lucky enough to have worked on the show, they will know that we really do have the best time, it’s never felt like work and always been to me like a night out..’
Holly went on to tease who her replacement could be as she continued: ‘Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work… all good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever… It’s time for me to hand over my team captain seat to some lucky lucky person… whoever that is, know you are about to get one of the best jobs in telly working with one of comedies finest…Keith Lemon.
‘Where to begin… I remember starting this journey with you and saying “I think this might work”… my goodness me it did… three friends, you me and Fearne Cotton and that is what is at the heart of it.. friendship… I love the bones of you Lemon!
‘Thank you for making me laugh for twelve years… I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check… if I don’t see you through a week or next week or the week after… know you are always in my heart..’
Shortly after Holly’s announcement, Keith shared a hilarious video on social media with the sweetest caption.
‘I’ve had a lovely time working with you. You are the best!
‘I hope I’m lucky enough to work with you again one day.
‘Goodbye Holly Willoughby x’
Holly’s departure comes after close pal Fearne Cotton left Celeb Juice in 2018.
Celebrity Juice continues on Thursday, at 10pm, on ITV2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby says ‘all good things come to an end’ as she pays tribute to Keith Lemon after quitting Celebrity Juice</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HOLLY Willoughby has paid a heartfelt tribute to Celebrity Juice and its host Keith Lemon after quitting the show.
The TV star shared a collection of her best times with Keith on Instagram and wrote how "all good things must come to an end".
She said: "Thank you @celebjuiceofficial for 12 years of fantastic chaos... I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone.
"Thank you to you all for watching.. we’ve always had the loudest and best audiences.
"...it’s never felt like work and always been to me like a night out... Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work... all good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever...
Holly told her yet to be named successor they were in for an incredible time.
She continued: "It’s time for me to hand over my team captain seat to some lucky lucky person... whoever that is, know you are about to get one of the best jobs in telly working with one of comedies finest... @keithlemon ...
"Where to begin... I remember starting this journey with you and saying ‘I think this might work’... my goodness me it did... three friends, you me and @fearnecotton ... and that is what is at the heart of it.. friendship...

Last night The Sun exclusively revealed quit the comedy game show after 12 years.
The TV presenter, 39, who has three children with her producer husband Dan Baldwin, 45, wants to spend more time with her family.
Holly told the ITV2 show’s producers about her decision last week after filming several lockdown editions with host Leigh Francis, 47.
Since launching the panel series in 2008 Holly — mum to Harry, ten, Belle, eight, and Chester, five — has become one of the UK’s most successful female TV presenters.
She fronts ITV daytime show This Morning, alongside Phillip Schofield, 58, and filled in for Ant McPartlin, 44, two years ago on I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here.
Holly’s decision to quit Celebrity Juice comes after pal and fellow panellist Fearne Cotton, 38, left the series in 2018 to focus on new projects.
A TV source said: “Holly has absolutely loved her time on the show — it’s been a huge part of her life, and has really helped to expand her fanbase over the years.
“But she feels now is the right time to bow out and wants to free up a bit more of her busy schedule to spend with her family.
“She’s still the best of pals with Leigh Francis and will continue to support the series.”
Yesterday comic Leigh posted a touching tribute to the star on his alias Keith Lemon’s Instagram page.
He wrote: “Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in.
“One of the boys but all woman. A wicked sense of humour and very easy to look at.
“Don’t look into her eyes though, ’cos she can make you do anything. What a lady! King of the ladies!
“The queen of the milk beasts! The one and only @hollywilloughby face of an angel but can have the potty mouth of . . . well me I guess.
"Super rad! Super nice! My mate!
“I salute all your wonderfulness. Massive hugs.”
Holly replied: “Aww . . .  what a lovely thing to say . . .  love you Lemon.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Celebrity Juice: Keith Lemon shares hilarious Holly Willoughby video as This Morning presenter 'quits' series</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has reportedly quit Celebrity Juice after 12 years.
The This Morning presenter has been a panellist on the ITV2 series since it began in 2008, but is said to be stepping down to spend more time with her family.
Willoughby follows Fearne Cotton, who quit the show in December 2018. Cotton’s replacement, Paddy McGuinness, left after one series before Spice Girl Mel B took over.
It’s unknown who could replace Willoughby.
A number of episodes recorded in lockdown are expected be her last appearance on the series, which is presented by Keith Lemon.
“Holly has absolutely loved her time on the show – it’s been a huge part of her life, and has really helped to expand her fanbase over the years,” a source told The Sun on Sunday.
“But she feels now is the right time to bow out and wants to free up a bit more of her busy schedule to spend with her family.”
Ahead of the reports, Lemon shared a video of Willoughby on Instagram, in which he looks shocked as she shouts the word “f***” at the screen.
He captioned it: “Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in. One of the boys but all woman. Super rad! Super nice! My mate! I salute all your wonderfulness. Massive hugs.”
Willoughby responded: “Aww... what a lovely thing to say... love you Lemon.”
The Independent has contacted a representative of Willoughby for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby QUITS Celebrity Juice 12 years after ITV panel show helped make her a household name</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has quit ITV’s Celebrity Juice – the show that helped make her a household name – after 12 years.
The presenter will end her reign as a team captain on the award-winning panel show at the end of the current series.
Insiders say the decision comes as a blow to programming chiefs, who have long relied on her star quality to attract viewers.
Although 39-year-old Miss Willoughby had worked in television for several years before Celebrity Juice, landing the role on the show in 2008 helped make her TV hot property.
She joined This Morning a year later and still hosts the show with Phillip Schofield. Celebrity Juice is also where the term ‘Holly Willoughbooby’ was coined to described her curvaceous figure.
Her resignation comes shortly after her husband Dan Baldwin – one of Celebrity Juice’s creators – stopped producing the ITV2 show. 
The mother of three’s departure now throws the future of the series into doubt after its host Keith Lemon, the comic alter-ego of Leigh Francis, said it would be over if she quit. 
A friend of Miss Willoughby told The Mail on Sunday: ‘She absolutely loves being on the show, she has loved it but she felt it was time now. 
'She wants to spend more time with her family, filming Celebrity Juice takes up an evening that she could be spending with her family.
‘She is, after all, one of the busiest women in showbiz.’
Yesterday, Francis paid tribute to Miss Willoughby on Instagram under his guise as Keith Lemon, saying: ‘Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in. One of the boys but all woman.’ A spokesman for Miss Willoughby last night declined to comment.
It is believed the star will make an announcement on Sunday May 3.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nicola Mclean dishes the dirt on hellish stars during I'm a Celeb stint</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nicola Mclean has told how former I'm A Celeb 2008 camp mate David Van Day wound her up on the show and was an "absolute t***".
The former glamour model, 38, invited fans to take part in a Q & A session on her Instagram stories.
When asked who was her most favourite and least contestant on the eighth series of the show Nicola told how former 80s pop star, 63, infuriated her.
She said: "My least favourite was David Van Day because he was an absolute t***. Literally his sole purpose was to p*** everyone off. it worked good for him but oh my god it was hell to live with."
David Van Day has been approached by Mirror Online for comment.
Nicola invited her fans to ask her questions to 'give her some entertainment during self-isolation'.
She said: "Entertain me guys, ask me some advice, tell me some outrageous stories, ask me a question, anything you want."
When one fan asked how is she coping with lockdown, Nicola said
'she was doing alright now, but took her a while to get used to it'.
Another fan asked if she would ever get a bum job?
Nicola replied: "No I hate them, I hate big bums I want to look straight up and down with big boobs."
Nicola claimed in November 2017 that David, who rose to fame in the duo Dollar, made sexual advances towards her on camera.
Responding to the comments, David Van Day's wife, Sue Moxley, told MailOnline : "This was all a bit of harmless fun for TV. It was before I met David nine years ago. I don't know why this is being brought up now. She hasn't been in the press much recently.
"I though Nicola and I were friends. It would have been nice if she gave me the heads up. We've actually all posed together as a group at a red carpet event since the programme aired and everything was fine and friendly."
Nicola is married to footballer Tom Williams, and the couple have two sons, Rocky and Striker.
Nicola finished sixth I'm A Celebrity... and also appeared in CelebrityBig Brother

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lucy Mecklenburgh breastfeeds baby Roman as Ryan Thomas makes her breakfast in bed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LUCY Mecklenburgh shared an adorable snap of her breastfeeding baby son Roman today as fiancé Ryan Thomas treated her to breakfast in bed.
Cradling her son in her arms, makeup Lucy smiled while sitting with banana pancakes on her lap.
She shared the pic on Instagram and wrote: "HAPPY SUNDAY!! Roman’s breakfast first then tired Mummas."
Her followers praised Ryan for rustling up brekkie, with one writing: "You are spoilt by all these lovely breakfasts! I was lucky if I got a cup of tea!!!! 😘😘😘."
The actor recently hailed Lucy a “supermum” after their first baby together was born in isolation.
The Manchester-born star admitted they have found it challenging since son Roman’s arrival last month as they haven’t been able to call on family for support.
Normally Ryan, 35, would be celebrating the new addition with his brothers — former Emmerdale actor Adam, 31, and his twin, Love Island’s Scott — and their parents Dougie James and Gail Waring.
But the pandemic has forced Ryan and ex-Towie regular Lucy, 28, to isolate alone at their home in Essex.
It also meant Ryan’s 11-year-old daughter Scarlett — who he co-parents with his ex, Coronation street actress Tina O’Brien, 36 — had to wait a few weeks before meeting her baby brother.
Ryan, who played Corrie’s Jason Grimshaw for 16 years until 2016, revealed: “Lucy has been a supermum.
“There is no rule book about being a mother and I think it has been a day-to-day challenge and she has dealt with it all amazingly, I’m super proud of her.”
Ryan plans to have a big party in Manchester with his family as soon as the Government advises it is safe to do so.
He said: “It’s been difficult having the new baby and not being with the boys, it’s just not a normal situation.
“The first thing we do when our kids are born is show them off to the brothers. But we’ve been keeping touch and FaceTime a lot.
“My daughter is sharing her time between me and her mum. She’s gone home today and then she’ll be back next week or the week after.”
Ryan joked that he wants to recreate the iconic scene from Disney’s Lion King when monkey Rafiki presents newborn Simba to the Pride Rock animals.
He said: “Hopefully this all dies down and I can drive him home to Manchester and give him the whole Lion King experience.”
Lucy told fans on Instagram that Ryan is proving himself to be a proactive dad, mucking in with night feeds and when she is busy running her fitness and nutrition website.
She met Ryan three years ago, when they both appeared on Channel 4’s Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls. Lucy said of motherhood: “I’m good. Some days are hard, but Ryan has been so supportive and hands-on it’s helped me so much.
“It’s not always easy getting him to sleep but white noise is a lifesaver.”
The birth came after Ryan took to social media to describe the “fear and loneliness” of bringing a baby into the world while in lockdown.
It inspired the kind-hearted actor to offer nappies, babygrows and formula to parents who are struggling financially.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lucy Mecklenburgh had a perfectly lazy Sunday morning as she breastfed her baby boy Roman before devouring breakfast in bed. 
The former Towie star gave her social media followers a glimpse into her new morning routine after she and fiance Ryan Thomas welcomed their son Roman two months ago. 
And it’s looking a little different these days with feeding Roman obviously the priority first thing on a Sunday morning. 
Lucy, 28, shared a photo of herself smiling at the camera while breastfeeding her baby boy with a breakfast tray in front of her. 
It looks as though Ryan, 35, prepared the most deliciously sweet brekkie including banana pancakes drizzled with chocolate syrup and a cup of coffee in a mug with ‘mummy’ on it. 
‘HAPPY SUNDAY!! Roman’s breakfast first then tired Mummas 🥞 💤 #stayhome #staysafe #breakfastinbed #mumlife #nomakeup #pancakes,’ Lucy captioned the image. 
It comes after Lucy shared her reservations about Roman getting his first set of injections. 
‘Romans immunisations are very soon.. Also both our post natal checks,’ she explained. 
‘And I’m not gonna lie I feel anxious. I feel like we have been isolating for so long in our safe bubble I don’t want him to be near anyone. or in pain from the [injection emoji]. 
‘This has made me feel a little better! I also realise they are super important!!’ 
Lucy and Ryan also spent some quality time with the former Coronation Street actor’s daughter Scarlett, with the family grabbing some fresh air amid lockdown with baby Roman strapped to Lucy’s chest in a carrier. 
‘Love it when I’ve got all my squad together,’ Ryan said alongside the cute family selfie. 
The family are finally reunited after Scarlett had to wait a couple of weeks to meet baby Roman to avoid possibly exposing the newborn to coronavirus. 
‘Thank God for technology! I’m finding it really tough being away from my family and sad this is how my daughter met her baby brother,’ Ryan told his social media followers at the time.
‘To any other broken families I feel your pain and it’s killing me being apart from my daughter and family for so long, especially at this special time. ‘BUT we all need to take social isolation and social distancing seriously and it’s a sacrifice we have to make to save lives.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lucy Mecklenburgh breastfeeds son Roman before tucking in to breakfast in bed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Television star Lucy Mecklenburgh has been snapped breastfeeding her baby son before breakfast in bed today.
The former The Only Way Is Essex star, 28, gave birth to son Roman in March with her fiancé Ryan Thomas.
Lucy became engaged to the former Coronation Street actor in June last year after they began dating in 2017.
Ryan already has a daughter named Scarlett with his former Corrie co-star Tina O'Brien.
Now, Lucy has posted an image of her ideal Sunday morning - breastfeeding adorable Roman and getting breakfast served to her in bed by his daddy Ryan.
Sharing the delightful image with her Instagram followers, Lucy looks gorgeous and is a glowing new mother accompanied by some yummy-looking pancakes.
She captioned the image: "HAPPY SUNDAY!! Roman’s breakfast first then tired Mummas' #stayhome #staysafe #breakfastinbed #mumlife #nomakeup #pancakes"
Her openness with the natural routine of breastfeeding was praised by her fans in the comments section.
One of Lucy's followers replied to the post: "Love how open you’re being with motherhood and breastfeeding."
Another joked: "The art of picking at your food when babe is feeding.
"Did you even breastfeed if you didn’t end up with crumbs on your babe's head?"
A different fan of Lucy's commented: "Awwww love this! You’re doing amazingly mama!"
Sadly, Ryan is facing time away from his brothers Adam and Scott due to the coronavirus pandemic.
He recently revealed on This Morning: "The toughest thing of all is my brothers haven't even met my son yet and I can't wait..."
We're sure they'll love him when they meet him!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stacey Solomon films herself while sitting on the toilet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Celebrity mum Stacey Solomon has filmed herself sitting on the toilet after being rudely interrupted by her son Rex.
Stacey, 30, was trying to take a moment to herself when her 11-month-old baby barged in to say hello.
In scenes familiar to parents everywhere, the Loose Women star captured the funny moment on camera before sharing it online.

Stacey's legs can be seen as she asks: "Can I go to the toilet please? Can I? Can I go to the toilet in peace?"
The mum-of-three also captioned her Instagram stories post: "When you don't shut the toilet door properly.
"Haven't finished a poo since [I] became a mum in 2008."
Stacey, who welcomed Rex into the world with long-term boyfriend Joe Swash in May 2019, is loved for her honesty about parenting.
The star is also mum to Zachery and Leighton from previous relationships and she isn't shy about documenting her motherhood journey online.
Following the toilet incident, Stacey revealed that she was having quite a day with Rex. In another clip, the star managed to film herself as she held the tot in one arm and peeled potatoes with her other hand.
She admitted; "He has decided against the morning nap and also does not want to be put down...at all!"
Breaking into Blue's hit song One Love, Stacey sang: "It's okay. I'll just have to do everything with...one hand, for the mother's cry, one hand, for the times we cry!"
Meanwhile, on Saturday night (May 2, 2020), Stacey experienced a dramatic near miss thanks to Joe, 38.
The Dancing On Ice 2020 winner convinced Stacey to perform a move he had learned on the ITV show...and almost dropped her!
As one of her older sons filmed, Stacey said: "I don't want to do it, give me my phone back.
"No, I'm not going backwards, no, what the hell?! What the hell, Joe?!"
Stacey was then seen yelping as Joe tried, and failed, to elegantly hoist her onto his shoulder.
She then screamed: "How did you win this, Joe? I'll dismount the other way! No, Joe, no!"

Thankfully Stacey made it back down to the ground in one piece...and all was forgiven within a few hours.
The couple were snapped cuddled up together with their pet dog before heading to bed. Phew!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hoda Kotb Shares An Adorable Instagram Photo Of Her Daughter’s Ice Cream Party</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Helen Storms
Hoda Kotb and her daughters are making the most of quarantine.
The Today Show’sHoda Kotb and her two young daughters are making the most of quarantine with an ice cream party. In an adorable Instagram photo that 55-year-old Kotb shared on Saturday, her 3-year-old daughter Haley Joy can be seen munching on an ice cream cone.
Kotb stood outside of her family’s New York city home as she snapped a photo of her daughter through an open window. Haley stood inside smiling up at her mother, gripping a half eaten cone in one hand with ice cream and sprinkles all over her mouth. She wore purple glasses and a pink Sesame Street t-shirt. Behind Haley was a small table with what appears to be a child’s homemade ice cream machine on top. It included everything she needed to make the perfect cone, including ice cream scoops and a glass dish with colorful sprinkles.
While the 3-year-old was not likely actually selling her cones, she had made it look like a mini ice cream stand. With the help of her mother she drew pictures of ice cream cones and hearts on colorful construction paper which were taped up on the window frame. One sign read the cones were a mere $.10 while another cheerful looking pink sign read “Haley and Hope’s Ice Cream Party.” Even though 1-year-old Hope was not in the photo, it was clear she had been included in the fun.
Hoda Kotb’s followers loved the sweet photo and it soon racked up over 33,000 likes in just an hour. Kotb has a whopping 1.6 million followers on the platform overall. Many of her fans took to the comment section to compliment her on the sweet photo, some saying they liked her creative idea and might try it out with their own children.
“It looks like the staff there is eating all the goodies!!” one person joked.
“What an adorable and happy child!” another person gushed.
“I’ll bet any day with Hope and Haley is a fun party day,” one fan wrote.
One person jokingly pointed out in the midst of all that is going on in the world, little Haley might want to consider raising the price of her ice cream a little bit.
“Up it to $.25 it’s 2020,” they wrote.
As The Inquisitr previously reported, the coronavirus pandemic has caused Kotb and her fiance Joel Schiffman to discuss postponing their wedding. They had hoped for a simple beach wedding over the summer but are considering putting things on hold for now to be safe.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hollywood artist teams up with Qatar-based sister to tutor Arabic-speaking kids during pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Los Angeles: It was during a phone conversation with her sister back in Qatar that the idea clicked for Hollywood animation artist Reem Ali Adeeb.
Like other regions across the world, young children in the Middle East were confined at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but there was not nearly enough original content online in Arabic to keep them entertained, such as fun tutorials and other activities.
So Ali Adeeb, a Syrian-born animation artist who works at Warner Bros. Entertainment in Los Angeles, and her sister Sandi, a university lecturer of pharmaceutics in Qatar, decided to take matters into their own hands.
The pair set up "Susupreemo," a YouTube channel designed to help Arabic-speaking kids -- and their stressed-out parents -- weather the coronavirus lockdowns through basic tutorials on drawing, making origami or simply reading children's books, all in Arabic.
"The idea is to create videos to engage the kids," said Ali Adeeb, who at Warner Bros. has worked on children's shows including "Green Eggs and Ham," a Netflix animated series based on the Dr. Seuss classic.
"There's tons of content on the web in English for kids but there is not enough original content in Arabic," added the 34-year-old who is now working from home on the second season of the Netflix show.
"So the aim is to make their screen time interactive and inspiring by drawing with them, reading them a story or doing crafts."
Ali Adeeb said her sister's 7-year-old son Omar has even joined in the fun, offering origami tutorials to his peers.
"He's been the best. He's done the most among us with three videos recorded already," she said.
Ali Adeeb herself is using some of the characters from "Green Eggs and Ham," notably Chickeraffe, a chicken/giraffe hybrid, to draw young viewers into her world.
Sandi for her part keeps her young audience focused and allows their imagination to travel by reading them children's books.
"I thought I would read for kids during a time where buying or lending a book is very challenging, especially for some disadvantaged kids in some Arab countries," she told AFP in an email.
"I started with a book suitable for children aged 3 to 6 years old and now I am selecting more books that can engage the kids for longer periods," she added.
A new reality
The response, so far, has been overwhelmingly positive with children enthusiastically sharing their drawings via email and parents thankful for the opportunity to be able to hold work meetings online without being interrupted or just have some time for themselves.
In a region often wracked by war, and where children faced a harsh reality even before the pandemic, experts say such tutorials offer kids a reprieve whether in the comfort of their homes or even in refugee camps.
"Nowadays, children worldwide are confined in their homes and children in the Middle East are no exception," said Annamaria Laurini, the former head of UNICEF in Lebanon.
"Suddenly their own world has disappeared -- no more school, no more play with their friends and no more human interactions except with their family," she added. "It's a lonely reality that makes it difficult to dream, that confines their imagination to the walls of their room -- if they are so lucky to have one."
Soha Bsat Boustani, a UNICEF consultant based in Beirut, said the YouTube tutorials are much needed in a region where such material in Arabic for children is lagging in terms of creativity and innovation.
"And so, initiatives like 'Susupreemo' can only be seen in a positive light as it gives children a healthy way out of confinement and a sense of normalcy."
So far Ali Adeeb, her sister and nephew have produced seven videos and they hope to continue with their project even after the pandemic.
"I'm thinking now of teaching kids how to draw popular cartoon characters ... and I'm hoping to open this space for other artists," she said. "I have a friend who is a dancer and I would love for her to teach kids how to dance.
"There's a lot more we can do."

Sandi for her part keeps her young audience focused and allows their imagination to travel by reading them children's books.
"I thought I would read for kids during a time where buying or lending a book is very challenging, especially for some disadvantaged kids in some Arab countries," she told AFP in an email.
"I started with a book suitable for children aged 3 to 6 years old and now I am selecting more books that can engage the kids for longer periods," she added.
The response, so far, has been overwhelmingly positive with children enthusiastically sharing their drawings via email and parents thankful for the opportunity to be able to hold work meetings online without being interrupted or just have some time for themselves.
In a region often wracked by war, and where children faced a harsh reality even before the pandemic, experts say such tutorials offer kids a reprieve whether in the comfort of their homes or even in refugee camps.
"Nowadays, children worldwide are confined in their homes and children in the Middle East are no exception," said Annamaria Laurini, the former head of UNICEF in Lebanon.
"Suddenly their own world has disappeared – no more school, no more play with their friends and no more human interactions except with their family," she added. "It's a lonely reality that makes it difficult to dream, that confines their imagination to the walls of their room – if they are so lucky to have one."
Soha Bsat Boustani, a UNICEF consultant based in Beirut, said the YouTube tutorials are much needed in a region where such material in Arabic for children is lagging in terms of creativity and innovation.
"And so, initiatives like 'Susupreemo' can only be seen in a positive light as it gives children a healthy way out of confinement and a sense of normalcy."
So far Ali Adeeb, her sister and nephew have produced seven videos and they hope to continue with their project even after the pandemic.
"I'm thinking now of teaching kids how to draw popular cartoon characters ... and I'm hoping to open this space for other artists," she said. "I have a friend who is a dancer and I would love for her to teach kids how to dance."There's a lot more we can do."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hollywood artist tutors Arabic-speaking kids during pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Los Angeles, United States | AFP |  It was during a phone conversation with her sister back in Qatar that the idea clicked for Hollywood animation artist Reem Ali Adeeb.
Like other regions across the world, young children in the Middle East were confined at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but there was not nearly enough original content online in Arabic to keep them entertained, such as fun tutorials and other activities.
So Ali Adeeb, a Syrian-born animation artist who works at Warner Bros. Entertainment in Los Angeles, and her sister Sandi, a university lecturer of pharmaceutics in Qatar, decided to take matters into their own hands.
The pair set up “Susupreemo,” a YouTube channel designed to help Arabic-speaking kids — and their stressed-out parents — weather the coronavirus lockdowns through basic tutorials on drawing, making origami or simply reading children’s books, all in Arabic.
“The idea is to create videos to engage the kids,” said Ali Adeeb, who at Warner Bros. has worked on children’s shows including “Green Eggs and Ham,” a Netflix animated series based on the Dr. Seuss classic.
“There’s tons of content on the web in English for kids but there is not enough original content in Arabic,” 
added the 34-year-old who is now working from home on the second season of the Netflix show. “So the aim is to make their screen time interactive and inspiring by drawing with them, reading them a story or doing crafts.”
Ali Adeeb said her sister’s 7-year-old son Omar has even joined in the fun, offering origami tutorials to his peers.
“He’s been the best. He’s done the most among us with three videos recorded already,” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Quebec designer launches mask line inspired by star skaters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONTREAL - A Quebec fashion designer has launched a line of high-end designer masks inspired by the costumes of the Olympic figure skaters he dresses.
Mathieu Caron has been designing and manufacturing outfits for several years, including the spectacular outfits worn by Canadian Olympic champion Tessa Virtue and world silver medalist Shoma Uno of Japan, among others.
The profits from the mask sales go to the World Health Organization in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
"We took the same materials as the skaters’ costumes, the same decorations, the same design, but we completely recreated the form to make masks,” said Caron, who also designs dancewear, gownS and wedding dresses.
"My primary goal was to make sure that the artistic side could come to help a little, raise funds to make a difference and at the same time make a collection item a little more glamorous than an ordinary mask.”
The limited-edition masks are not for all budgets - the eight models cost between $150 and $300.
Japanese customers were not deterred, snatching items inspired by Uno’s costumes, which retail for $200 to $250. Initially, the idea was to design a maximum of 15 masks for each skater, but in Japan, they sold 70.
"I was surprised,” Caron said. "In times of crisis like this, I honestly didn’t think people had so much money to buy a mask.”
Caron says his goal was not to heighten his brand.
"It was more an artistic contribution to do our part with some members of my team who also got involved in the decoration,” he said. "But with everything we have sold, we will not be unemployed for the next few weeks.”
The masks are made of cotton and polyester fibers. The fabrics come from the same materials as the skaters’ outfits. The material is breathable, with padding to give shape and structure.
"Now, is it something medical? Not at all,” Caron said. "We would rather call it a fashion accessory, a collector’s item.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Designer Mathieu Caron launches high-end masks inspired by Olympic skaters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONTREAL -- Quebec designer Mathieu Caron, whose creations are among the most seen in the world, is launching a line of limited edition, high-end masks inspired by figure skating costumes he designed.
For years, Caron, who hails from Longueuil, has designed spectacular skating costumes seen by millions of viewers, including those of Olympic champion Tessa Virtue and Olympic silver medalist Shoma Uno.
“We took the same materials as the skaters' costumes, the same decorations, the same design, but we completely redid the form to make masks,' said Caron, who also makes dance clothes and other clothing equipment for sports and training.
PROCEEDS GO TO THE WHO
The eight luxury mask models are priced between $150 and $300.
“During this pandemic, my main goal was to make sure that the artistic side could come to help a little, raise funds to make a difference and at the same time make a collection item a little more glamorous than a ordinary mask,” said Caron, noting that all of the proceeds from mask sales will go to the World Health Organization.
Caron reportedly sold over 245 masks in three hours.
The masks especially gained popularity in Japan where the retail price ranges between $200 and $250. 
“I was surprised. I didn't think that in times of crisis like this, people had so much money to buy a mask, honestly,” he said. 
The mask craze quickly led to the hashtag #Showmask. 
ADEQUATE PROTECTION 
Although the mask designs follow health recommendations, Caron insists that they should not be considered medical equipment. 
“It protects very well,” said Caron. “In terms of fabrics, there are cotton and polyester fibers, so it follows the recommendations…. But is this something ‘medical’ ? Not at all. We would rather call it a fashion accessory, a collector's item.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Quebec designer launches mask line inspired by star skaters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONTREAL (AP) — A Quebec fashion designer has launched a line of high-end designer masks inspired by the costumes of the Olympic figure skaters he dresses.
Mathieu Caron has been designing and manufacturing outfits for several years, including the spectacular outfits worn by Canadian Olympic champion Tessa Virtue and world silver medalist Shoma Uno of Japan, among others.
The profits from the mask sales go to the World Health Organization in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
“We took the same materials as the skaters’ costumes, the same decorations, the same design, but we completely recreated the form to make masks,” said Caron, who also designs dancewear, gowns and wedding dresses.
“My primary goal was to make sure that the artistic side could come to help a little, raise funds to make a difference and at the same time make a collection item a little more glamorous than an ordinary mask.”
The limited-edition masks are not for all budgets — the eight models cost between $150 and $300.

Japanese customers were not deterred, snatching items inspired by Uno’s costumes, which retail for $200 to $250. Initially, the idea was to design a maximum of 15 masks for each skater, but in Japan, they sold 70.
“I was surprised,” Caron said. “In times of crisis like this, I honestly didn’t think people had so much money to buy a mask.”
Caron says his goal was not to heighten his brand.
“It was more an artistic contribution to do our part with some members of my team who also got involved in the decoration,” he said. “But with everything we have sold, we will not be unemployed for the next few weeks.”
The masks are made of cotton and polyester fibers. The fabrics come from the same materials as the skaters’ outfits. The material is breathable, with padding to give shape and structure.
“Now, is it something medical? Not at all,” Caron said. “We would rather call it a fashion accessory, a collector’s item.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Love Island’s Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury tricked into thinking they’re on James Corden’s US chatshow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOVE Island's Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury were duped into thinking they were appearing on James Corden's hit American chat show in a cruel prank.
The pair appeared via link from their Manchester home believing they were talking to the Gavin & Stacey star - but were actually being played old clips off him.
YouTube pranksters Josh Pieters and Archie Manners were behind the elaborate joke, posing as TV producers who told them they wouldn't be able to see James because of technical issues.
The pair then played Tommy and Molly old clips of the Late Late Show host from previous shows, including the same recording of the host saying "Oh woooow" which popped up again and again.
The first question seemed to catch them by surprise with 'James' saying: "I don't know if people know this - you two are a couple. You're dating."
Seeming surprised that the fact might have escaped anyone, Tommy replied: "You could call it dating if you want. We might be a little bit past that, but OK."
The pair continued with their questions punctuating it regularly with the same clips of James giggling.
Another recording of the 41-year-old TV star heard him saying: "Now in the UK everybody knows what you do. Try to explain to these folks if you can a little what it is you actually do?"
Tommy, 20, replied that he was a "professional boxer" and Molly a "full-time influencer" as they explained the story of their Love Island romance.
The fake host then asked who they would want to play them in a movie, with Tommy saying Leonardo DiCaprio while Molly-Mae chose his Wolf Of Wall Street co-star Margot Robbie.
 
The clip ended with the pair seemingly none the wiser that they had been tricked - and that, contrary to what they had been told, would not be appearing on The Late Late Show.
Nonetheless it delighted YouTube fans, with one laughing: "The 'Oh wooow' sounds so fake that I die every time it comes up."
Another wrote: "I kinda feel like some of these guys are having their doubts but don’t wanna risk it actually being James Corden."
Tommy and Molly-Mae shot to reality-star fame on Love Island's summer series last year but were unexpectedly beaten to the top prize by Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea.
Yet, Love Island fans will not see the popular show return in 2020 after the summer series was cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Molly Mae Hague and Tommy Fury pranked into thinking they landed a James Corden interview</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Molly Mae Hague and Tommy Fury are the latest stars to fall victim to notorious celebrity prankster Josh Pieters.
He made the oblivious Love Island finalists think they were being interviewed by James Corden on the Late Late Show.
Clips of the US favourite asking random questions were snatched from other shows by the YouTube star, who cobbled together an interview as the pair sat on their sofa dressed to impress.
They were told by a fake producer that transatlantic issues means they couldn't actually see James asking his questions - but he could see them.
Like his others victims, they only find out when the video drops online.
They didn't even twig when a soundbite of James saying 'oh wow' was played a number of times at their less than amazing answers.
James begun: "So, you two are dating?"
Confused boxer Tommy responded: "It might be a bit past dating, but call it that if you want!"
Fake James then asked them to explain what it is they actually do.
He also wanted to know who would play them in a movie - and asked who was doing the housework in lockdown.
The comedian kept them going for a few minutes without the couple thinking a thing was wrong.
Funnyman Josh has history - he wound up Katie Hopkins by dragging the controversial star to Prague to collect a fake award earlier this year.
He presented Katie with a trophy for a lifetime achievement award at a fake ceremony for made-up campaign group The Cape Town Collective For Freedom of Speech.
Josh said he emailed her asking if she would fly to accept their made-up award, dubbed the Campaign to Unify the Nation Trophy.
Things turned controversial as she was recorded mocking Muslims, Asian people and epilepsy sufferers.
Fans loved his latest prank as he stitched up the Love Island stars.
"Josh! You're spoiling us!!!" one posted.
Another said: "Let's just hope James Corden sees the funny side!"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury pranked into James Corden ‘interview’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Love Island stars Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury are among the latest stars to have fallen victim to prankster Josh Pieters. 
The couple were tricked into believing they had landed an interview on the Late Late Show with James Corden recently when actually, it was YouTube star Josh orchestrating the fake chat behind the scenes. 
Molly-Mae and Tommy, both 20, thought they were in communication with a producer who had booked them in for a spot on the US chat show via video link, due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
However, it was simply Josh and his crew using segments of an old interview James did with Julia Michaels and JP Saxe. 
In one of his lines, James says: ‘I don’t know if people know this but you are a couple? You’re dating.’ 
The reality stars nodded in unison – although slightly confused at the obvious line of questioning – as Tommy confirmed: ‘You can call it dating if you want, yeah. It might be a little bit past that but OK,’ referring to the fact they’ve lived together for months.’ 
James then ‘asked’ how the couple have been coping ‘sheltering’ together during the lockdown, to which Molly-Mae replied: ‘It’s been fine, he’s been working out a lot. I’ve been doing a lot of tidying.’ 
Boxer Tommy added: ‘I miss being punched in the face but what can you do?’ 
At one point, the so-called producers make out there’s a wifi issue between Tommy and Molly and James, prompting them to momentarily halt the interview before resuming. 
The talk show host then asks Tommy who he’d love to play in a movie to which the boxer chose Leonardo DiCaprio, while Molly-Mae opted for Margot Robbie so they could have a ‘Wolf of Wall Street moment’. 
‘Producer’ Josh then wrapped up the interview with an outro from James, bringing his prank to a close without suspicion.
Tommy and Molly shouldn’t feel too bad though as they aren’t the only stars who have been targeted in Josh’s three-day prank series – singer Craig David also made the cut. 
Earlier this year, Josh famously pranked Katie Hopkins into believing she had won a Campaign to Unify the Nation Trophy award, even flying her out to Prague, but it was entirely fake.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kyle Walker's ex 'brands Lauryn Goodman heartless h**' after birth of their baby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kyle Walker's ex appears to have hit out at Lauryn Goodman after the birth of their baby.
Annie Kilner, 27, seemed to call Lauryn a ''heartless h**' in a thinly-veiled dig on Instagram on Sunday.
She had dated the England footballer, 29, for 10 years and had three children with him but they split in April after his affair with Laura Brown.
Lauryn, also 29, and Kyle briefly dated last summer and welcomed a baby last month but they aren't a couple.
Taking to Instagram on Sunday, an angry Annie wrote: "A man who disrespects a loyal woman deserves a heartless h**."
Lauryn appeared to take the dig as directed at her and fired back.
"This is harassment," she fumed.
"I've just had a new born baby and I'm dealing with this on a Sunday morning!'
She continued: "I just want to say thank you so much to everyone for your support.
"I am so lucky to have such supportive and caring followers who do not believe lies.
"I have said repeatedly, I was never ever friends with [Annie] and her using my name in the press to gain sympathy for a relationship that had ended before our baby's conception is shocking!"
Lauryn announced their baby's birth last month on Instagram, though she is yet to reveal the baby's sex or name.
She became a mum despite fearing she'd never have the chance thanks to her battle with endometriosis.
She said: "This has truly been the biggest blessing and I keep crying just thinking I can't believe I've made you and you are here. I find myself just staring in awe thinking I have made this little special human.
"You have defied all odds and you are the best thing to have ever happened to me. Words can't describe the love I feel for you already. My #endo baby - you have been so strong and I cannot wait to start this journey with you."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ENGLAND footballer Kyle Walker's ex has taken a swipe at him and Lauryn Goodman after the birth of their baby.
Annie Kilner, 27, took to her Instagram stories last night to post a savage quote hitting out at "disrespectful men".
The post read: "A man who disrespects a loyal woman deserves a heartless hoe."
Reality star Lauryn, 29, welcomed her baby with England footballer Kyle last week.
She posted a picture of the child on Instagram and wrote: "I can't believe I've made you."
Earlier this year The Sun exclusively revealed Kyle's long-term former partner Annie called him “gutless” after he broke the news of Lauryn's pregnancy to her over the phone.
She also called him a “homewrecker” for romping with her pal.
Annie told a friend: “He’s a fool for risking his family for this. When he told me I was heartbroken. I also felt physically sick. All the air in your body leaves you.
“My world completely caved in on me in that second.
“It was the worst-case scenario, the one thing I dreaded most but knew was possible, given his track record with women.
“I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Not only had he cheated on me but she was pregnant with his baby.”
Manchester City full-back Kyle, who Lauryn named as the dad in February, is now a father for the fourth time.
Posting on Instagram after the birth, Lauryn wrote: "I want to introduce you all to my #MiracleBaby. It was the first night in the SnüzPod and it felt so great to have the 👶🏽 so close to me all night ❤️.
"Whenever a feed was due I could just reach on in there. This has truly been the biggest blessing and I keep crying just thinking I can’t believe I’ve made you and you are here.
"I find myself just staring in awe thinking I have made this little special human. You have defied all odds and you are the best thing to have ever happened to me."
Lauryn, who had feared she was unlikely to conceive due to her endometriosis, continued: "Words can’t describe the love I feel for you already. My #endo baby - you have been so strong and I cannot wait to start this journey with you. 💫❤️.
"There is a bit of a story labour wise and after my labour that I do want to share with you all, as I feel it’s so important to be open and honest because my platform can help others.
"But for now, I just wanted to share this moment with you all as you have been so amazing with your advice and messages! My little bed buddy 👶🏽- Welcome to this crazy 🌍."
The star, who was careful not to reveal the child's gender, concluded: "Thank you to everyone who messaged me & recommended the SnüzPod @snuzuk it’s been a dream. P.s 👶🏽 needs its first hair cut already 🤦🏼‍♀️."
She was bombarded with congratulations, with Lauren Goodger writing: "I can’t believe it I’ve been waiting for this day ! Your amazing and I can’t wait to meet bubba 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕."
Her sister, 26-year-old reality star Chloe, wrote: "The most amazing blessing ever!! I’m so obsessed with the little one already I’ve never been so in love I’m so proud of you for how you dealt with pregnancy and your labour 🤩."
Former EastEnders star Jacqueline Jossa posted: "Congratulations ❤️❤️."
Lauryn revealed the identity of the child's father in an interview with The Sun on Sunday, saying: "Rumours and gossip are starting to circulate and I’d rather people heard it from the horse’s mouth so I want to stop all the speculation once and for all.
“Kyle Walker and I are expecting a baby in April and it was conceived during a period we had both split from our previous partners.
"This will be the last time I comment on it and I will only be sharing the positive journey going forward.”
Lauryn's sister Chloe is also pregnant and will soon give birth to her first child, a little girl, with fiancé Grant Hall.

One of the much-loved actors in the industry, Rishi passed away at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital on Thursday, April 30.

The late actor had been taking treatment for leukemia in New York. In September last year, he had returned to India and announced that he was cancer-free.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">American Horror Story star Leslie Jordan has admitted Lady Gaga ‘rode him’ on the set of the show’s sixth season, Roanoke.
Well, you know she has said all along she wants a Bad Romance.
Leslie starred as actor Ashley Gilbert, who portrays medium Cricket Marlow in the show-within-a-show aspect of the season (hold on tight, this could get complicated.)
The actor shared on an Instagram post that he was sharing a scene with Gaga in one episode, where the Stupid Love hitmaker was portraying a malevolent witch.
But you could say things took an unexpected turn as they tried to get into character, as Gaga took him into the woods before the cameras started to roll.
Leslie revealed: ‘She took me in the woods right before [the scene] and she said “I tend to sexualise all my acting parts.”
‘Well, honey, she kicked me, rolled me over and got down and started riding me and howling at the moon, I didn’t know what I was supposed to do. ‘
He continued: ‘I just lay there and thought, “how do I get myself in these situations?”‘
Well, Leslie, to be honest with you – we don’t know. But we hoped you enjoyed your time with Academy Award-nominated actress Lady Gaga, dressed up as a witch and howling at the moon.
That’s certainly something worth shouting about.
American Horror Story is currently preparing to launch its tenth season, following last year’s ninth serial 1984, which was inspired my slasher films of the 1980s.
Gaga is currently very busy – her sixth album, Chromatica, was supposed to be released last month but has been pushed back due to the coronavirus.
Featuring on the album will be fellow pop superstar Ariana Grande, on a track called Rain On Me.
American Horror Story airs on FX in the US.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Hemsworth said co-star Tiffany Haddish ripped apart a script because it didn't properly portray a strip club</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During a recent interview on The Ellen Show, “Thor” actor Chris Hemsworth talked about the upcoming movie he’s starring in with comedian Tiffany Haddish, and said that working together revealed to him Haddish’s strip-club acumen.
The movie, called “Down Under Cover,” is an action-meets-comedy about a detective duo, Hemsworth and Haddish, who are tasked with shutting down multiple casino heists. Hemsworth’s character has to go undercover as a male stripper because they believe Australian male strippers are running the heists.
“Love her work. She’s hilarious,” Hemsworth said of his co-star. “What I didn’t know was how versed she was in the world of stripping, particularly male stripping, and she’s been to many a male strip club.”
Hemsworth said that once he and Haddish were given their scripts, she immediately “ripped the script apart” because it didn’t portray male strip clubs correctly. She pointed out parts of the plot, saying “this would never happen” and explained what the experience would be like in real life, Hemsworth told Degeneres.
Degeneres said she wasn’t surprised that Haddish was well-versed in strip clubs and said that the production was lucky to have her perspective.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Patty Jenkins explains why 'Wonder Woman 1984' has two villains</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES: Filmmaker Patty Jenkins has made it clear that it wasn't her idea to have two villains in her upcoming movie "Wonder Woman 1984" and says it happened organically.
The much-awaited film is a sequel to Jenkins' 2017 blockbuster "Wonder Woman", starring Gal Gadot as the titular DC superhero.
In the sequel, which will come out in August, Gadot's Wonder Woman will face-off against Barbara Ann Minerva aka Cheetah (Kristen Wiig) as well as businessman Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal).
"It turned out that the story was the thing that gave birth to the need for both (villains)," Jenkins told Total Film in an interview.
"It wasn't that I thought I needed both. Cheetah was the villain that we were focused on having in this movie, but then Max Lord, throughout the history of Wonder Woman comics - he serves a very mechanical purpose, often," she added.
The filmmaker also explained her decision to cast Wiig opposite Gadot in the sequel.
"It doesn't have to be against expectations, I think it has to be fresh, you know? If it was just a vixen...like, Gal's a model, a full-blown model.
If we cast another full-blown model and it's a cat fight? "That felt a little dull, versus a beautiful woman who's totally different - Kristen - who's really funny but a total juxtaposition to Gal.
So they have such a different space. I thought that was an interesting way to tell the story," Jenkins said.
As for Pascal, the director said the "Narcos" star has done a "fantastic" job with his character.
"Max Lord is a great 'Wonder Woman' character. I love him serving the role he is right now. Pedro Pascal is fantastic at this role.
It's like you've never seen him before too," Jenkins added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's always a treat when High School Musical stars revisit songs from the Disney classic. Vanessa Hudgens is one of the latest to take a trip down memory lane, as she recently crooned a socially distanced version of "Breaking Free" with Broadway actor Max Clayton. Hudgens, who plays Gabriella Montez in the film series, initially shared a clip of her performing the tune solo. But when her friend wanted in on the fun, she was totally game. "I LOVE @maxmclayton and u probably will too after u watch this lol," Hudgens captioned an Instagram teaser. "He did a duet and it's hilarious." The pair previously teamed up for a performance of High School Musical 2's "Gotta Go My Own Way" back in April.
Hudgens recently reconnected with her High School Musical costars for a performance of "We're All in This Together" during The Disney Family Singalong. Corbin Bleu, Ashley Tisdale, Monique Coleman, and Lucas Grabeel were among the former Wildcats featured in the special. Now, please excuse us while we go rewatch all three High School Musical movies.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Leslie Jordan has really been taking over social media amid the quarantine and the latest ‘Pillow Talk’ video proves just why! This time around, he decided to share a very funny but also quite bizarre story about Lady Gaga while together on the set of American Horror Story: Roanoke!
In the first clip posted on his IG account, Leslie starts by saying that: ‘Pillow talk! You know, I can just tell when I meet you, within 3 minutes, how you were raised.  When I met Lady Gaga on American Horror Story…beautifully brought up. ‘Please, thank you.’ Lovely girl. Told me to call her Stephanie.’
Next, he went on to recall having to film a scene with the talented singer and actress.
Apparently, contrary to his first impression, he got to know Gaga’s very out of the ordinary approach to acting!
‘We had a scene in which she was gonna blow fairy dust in my face, and knock me down, blind me, chase me, and roll me over, and kick me. Then she was supposed to squat down and cut me with a knife,’ he explained how the scene was supposed to go.
However, in a weird and shocking turn of events, Gaga apparently took Jordan to the woods before the shoot and warned him that she tends to always ‘sexualize’ her acting partners!
Then he went on to reveal that ‘Well honey, she kicked me, rolled me over, got down on me and just started riding me… I did not know what I was supposed to do! I just laid there and just thought, ‘How do I even get myself into these situations?’ Yikes.’ What a story!
While it may seem quite a bit bizarre and what she did might actually cross some huge lines, it sounds like the actor did not mind that much and was excited to share the experience with social media users everywhere. Hopefully!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Leslie Jordan knows how to tell a story, and the “Will & Grace” star took to Instagram on Saturday to share a doozy about Lady Gaga.
In the latest edition of his “Pillow Talk” Instagram series, the 65-year-old actor shared a hilarious story about his experience working with Gaga during “American Horror Story: Roanoke”.
Jordan began by explaining how impressed he was by Gaga when they first met.
“I can tell when I meet you, within three minutes, how you were raised,” he said. “When I met Lady Gaga on the ‘American Horror’ set… beautifully brought up. ‘Please, thank you.’ Lovely girl.”
In the series, Jordan played psychic Cricket Marlowe, while Gaga portrayed ancient witch Scathach.
“We had a scene where she was gonna blow fairy dust in my face, and then knock me down, and blind me, chase me, and then roll me over, kick me,” he explained. “And then she was supposed to squat down on me and cut me with a knife.”
In the two-part video (the first one ends when he sneezes), Jordan describes Gaga’s unique acting technique.
“She took me in the woods right before we shot, and she said, ‘You know, I tend to sexualize all my acting partners,'” he continued.
“I thought, ‘Where’s this going?’ Well honey, she kicked me, rolled me over, and got down on me and started riding me, howling at the moon” he added. “I didn’t know what I was supposed to do! I just laid there and thought, ‘How do I get myself into these situations?’ Yikes!”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Looks like Ryan Reynolds and Taika Waititi are doing everything to forget their DC film, Green Lantern. The 2011 superhero film was helmed by Martin Campbell in which the Deadpool actor played the titular role and Taika portrayed Thomas Kalmaku.
While the actors are trying to act like they never heard of Green Lantern, the moviegoers remember everything. In an interaction with Total Film Magazine, both Ryan Reynolds and Taika Waititi were asked about their 2011 film and they gave strange reactions.
Taika Waititi said, “What’s the project you’re talking about? I’ve never heard of it,” the actor/director says. “Green… what?” But Taika Waititi couldn’t resist talking about Green Lantern and all the fun he had working with Ryan Reynolds on it. The Jojo Rabbit director said, “No, that type of thing is great, because Ryan and I have both got a similar sense of humour in regards to things like that. I find it really funny that I did that film. The thing is, it’s like when people shy away from things, and they don’t want to admit they’ve done something, or they don’t ever reference it, I find it worse.”
He added, ” Because when you can make fun of yourself, then everybody else understands: ‘Oh, we’re all in on the joke’. Because if you pretend it never happened, then it makes it kind of weird and uncomfortable for everyone. [Pauses] I still don’t have any idea what that project is. I’m not entirely sure which one you’re talking about.”
To this, Ryan Reynolds added, “I’ve never met him.” Along with the duo, Green Lantern also starred Blake Lively. Both the actors are known for their amazing sense of humour and this time, they decided to make fun of their own film.
Currently, the Green Lantern duo is busy with the promotions their upcoming comedy-action film, Free Guy. The film is helmed by Shawn Levy and also stars Jodie Comer and Joe Keery.
We wonder what Blake Lively and DC Comics have to say about Taika and Ryan pretending to not know about Green Lantern!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ryan Reynolds and Taika Waititi have put out some excellent work, their work together on “Green Lantern” was not one of them.
The two have teamed up once again for “Free Guy” where they sat down with Total Film but both stars just couldn’t seem to remember their 2011 movie.
“What’s the project you’re talking about? I’ve never heard of it,” Taika joked.
“…No, that type of thing is great, because Ryan and I have both got a similar sense of humour in regards to things like that. I find it really funny that I did that film. The thing is, it’s like when people shy away from things, and they don’t want to admit they’ve done something, or they don’t ever reference it, I find it worse.”
He continued, “If an actor is brave enough or comfortable enough in themselves to acknowledge it, and to be self-deprecating, and to own that they have been a part of something that’s been lambasted a bit, then I think that’s great…because when you can make fun of yourself, then everybody else understands: ‘Oh, we’re all in on the joke.’ Because if you pretend it never happened, then it makes it kind of weird and uncomfortable for everyone.”
Waititi added, “I still don’t have any idea what that project is. I’m not entirely sure which one you’re talking about.”
Reynolds then quipped, “I’ve never met him. I still can’t quite figure out how we got him for [‘Free Guy’]. He just sort of said ‘yes’ right away.”
“Free Guy” hits theatres on Dec. 11, 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">First Blood and Brian Dennehy’s Charming, Down-to-Earth Villainy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“The only way to do it is to grab the fuckin’ audience by the throat, shake the shit out of ’em and say, ‘You think you’re getting out of here alive? You’re not. Prepare to spill your fucking blood, because I’m gonna spill mine, and you’re coming with me.’”—Dennehy, talking about the 2012 adaptation of The Iceman Cometh
“Character actor” is a term whose definition can be as expansive as the range of the actors it’s used to describe, but Brian Dennehy was an actor who immediately brought it to mind in his decades on the stage and screens large and small. Physically towering and intense, his lead roles tended to be wounded patriarchs and his supporting roles, even in his first appearances, had him playing cops, lawyers or other no-nonsense types.
Yet, within that fairly narrow typecasting, he revealed depth and vulnerability, always with a naturalistic touch and hardly ever leaving any toothmarks on the scenery. His turn as the villain in First Blood was his big break, but it was also emblematic of the more thoughtful nature of that first installment, before the series went into full-bore jingoism. Five films in, he remains the only villain in the series with even an iota of nuance.
Teasle: “If one of my deputies gets out of line with a prisoner, the prisoner comes to me with it. And if I find out it’s like he says, I kick the deputy’s ass—me, the law! That’s the way it’s gotta be. People start fuckin’ around with the law and all hell breaks loose!”
Sheriff Will Teasle (Dennehy) walks out of the precinct and pauses, framed against the gentle-blowing American flag, and then heads over to hop into his squad car, where he’s bracketed by the red and blue lights of the police cruiser and the purple mountain’s majesty towering over his small town. He is a paragon of American decency, backed up by the legitimacy of capital “D” Democracy. That the movie signals so clearly so early that it’s about such thorough disillusion is one of the most interesting things about it, and Dennehy’s character time and again illustrates it.
Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) drifts into town, wandering aimlessly in the knowledge that he is the last one of his elite group of Army badasses. Teasle singles him out for hassling, picking him up in his squad car and escorting him to the other end of town, for no reason other than that he doesn’t like the cut of Rambo’s jib. When Rambo quietly turns right back around and tries to head into town to get some food, Teasle’s immediate reaction is to escalate things.
Before anybody knows who he even is, the cops have roughed Rambo up and awakened his past trauma. The trouble is that unlike the many other un-charged detainees they’ve no doubt brutalized before him, Rambo isn’t so easily dominated. After beating the crap out of everybody in the station and fleeing into the hills, Rambo is hunted and nearly murdered by one of the most violent and heedless of Teasle’s deputies. When Rambo kills the guy in self-defense, Teasle of course throws all caution to the wind and leads a doomed manhunt into the mountains.
The most recent installment of the series, Rambo: Last Blood, also features Rambo Home Alone-ing some poor schmucks until only one hapless idiot remains to tell the tale. In this first film, he doesn’t actually kill any of Teasle’s men. The maiming he gives them, and the dire warning he gives to Teasle to back off, are the stuff of horror movies.
In town, Teasle is the law. He isn’t hunting Rambo because of any threat to the populace, or even to avenge his deputy. He’s doing it because he cannot abide the thought there is any place where he is not the law.
“I wanted to kill that kid. I wanted to kill him so bad I could taste it.” —Teasle, First Blood
“I want revenge. I want them to know that death is coming and there’s nothing they can do to stop it. I want them to know our grief. To know that’s the last they will ever feel.” —Rambo, Rambo: Last Blood
Dennehy clearly understands this, and it’s crucial that the film clearly understands it, too. It makes the whole thing all the more bizarre in context with the other Rambo movies, which throw nearly all ambiguity to the wind and assign Stallone the role of unerring, blameless lawman. In the fourth installment (2008’s confusingly titled Rambo), Stallone is dragged reluctantly back into a war zone where everything he says and does is right and everybody else is a dope: The villain murders non-combatants and rapes little boys and for the most part doesn’t even get subtitles on his dialogue.
It’s in the fifth, though, Rambo: Last Blood, that we get an essential reversal of everything that made the first movie interesting. Its earnest young female lead (Yvette Monreal) disobeys Rambo’s order to stay home and gets kidnapped, sold into sex slavery, and raped to death about ten seconds after. He dedicates the rest of the movie to shredding the bodies of the army of foreigners who killed her. This involves, again, Home Alone-ing a bunch of arrogant pricks to death, but this time Rambo actively goads them into coming onto his property. This time, there’s no forbearance. Indeed, Rambo has the drop on the final boss and spares him for the express purpose of literally pinning him to a wall and ripping his heart out of his chest.
The oddest choice the movie makes is ending on a montage of everything that came before. Scenes from First Blood flash over the credits, reminding us of how completely the series has strayed from where it began. I’m not sure if the movie itself knows this.
Dennehy’s Teasle gets a solemn moment of reflection near the end of First Blood, where he confides in Rambo’s Army handler the feelings of irrational rage the man raised in him. He sounds like I feel after I’ve had a fight with my fiancée’s 11-year-old: like he doesn’t recognize himself. It’s a bit of humanity he found in a not-particularly-deep stock villain role, as he so often would: Whether it was as a computer-generated rat who’s disappointed in his son’s culinary obsession or another crooked cop who betrays his team because he doesn’t want to die protecting a criminal. In the midst of such contrivance, you really believed him.
Dennehy died April 15 at the age of 81.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britt Ekland on Peter Sellers: ‘He was a very tormented soul’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Peter Sellers is widely admired as a British comic genius, the creator of some of the most memorable characters of 20th-century film and broadcasting. He was central to the cult 1960s BBC programme TheGoon Show, once described as “probably the most influential comedy show of all time”, while his later role as Chief Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther films brought him international stardom.
But in private he was a difficult, domineering and jealous man who married four times, and once said of himself: “If I can’t really find a way to live with myself, I can’t expect anyone else to live with me.” Now we have fresh testimony from one who tried – and failed.
Sellers’s former wife Britt Ekland has opened up about their troubled marriage, describing Sellers – who suffered from serious ill health as well as alcohol and cocaine dependency – as deeply controlling and mentally unstable, but unable to receive the medical treatment that he would have got today, partly because he was so valuable to the studios.
In a major BBC Arts documentary, Peter Sellers: A State Of Comic Ecstasy, the former Bond actress recalls her four-year marriage from 1964.
She remembers that Sellers would choose what she should wear, buying her entire wardrobe without consulting her, and threatening her with divorce “every Friday night – and by Monday there would be a make-up lunch or present”.
She adds: “He obviously suffered from or was bipolar, severely bipolar. He was a very tormented soul who should have had more help. But instead he was unable [to] because he was such a valuable asset.”
Sellers, who died in 1980, made his name, with Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine, through the seminal radio comedy The Goon Show. He became a global star with classic screen roles such as the inept Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther in 1963, to which he took Ekland on their first date.
The couple met after he saw a photograph of the Swedish actress in a newspaper and realised that they were both staying at the Dorchester in London. In the documentary’s archive footage, Sellers says: “I thought that I would like to meet what I saw.”
Ekland had come to Britain to be launched as 20th Century Fox’s new star. She recalls being in the bath when there was a knock at the door: “I wrapped a towel round me and rushed to open the door … This very tall gentleman said ‘I’m Mr Sellers’s valet’. Would I like to come to his suite?”
In a whirlwind romance, Sellers called her two days after their first date, she recalls: “He said, ‘I have told the press that we’re going to get married’ … By the time we married [it] was probably little more than three weeks [later].”
Returning from their honeymoon, she was photographed in a fur coat: “He decided what I was going to wear. He just pre-decided everything without ever asking me.”
Ekland, who went on to star in The Man With The Golden Gun, also recalls how Sellers’s actions got her fired from the 1964 film Guns at Batasi: “He called me and said, ‘Ask the production if you can have an extra day off’. And they said no. He just said that’s taken care of. Someone drove me to the airport. The next thing I know I land in California, where I’d never been before, with no clothes. The plan was I would spend the weekend and then I would fly back. When I arrived, he said, ‘I have a doctor here because you don’t look well’. The doctor said, ‘She’s suffering strain and stress. You can’t possibly go back to filming’.”
Asked in the documentary whether she was ill, she exclaims: “Of course not. I was 21 years old, fit as a fiddle, but I had no choice. I couldn’t have said, ‘I’m sorry, I love you, but I’ve got to go back to work now’. There was no option for that … I was fired from the film.”
She continues: “I was taken straight back to our marble palace. He took me into the bedroom, which was all gold and white, and then next to it was a walk-in closet. He’d bought everything you could possibly need as a woman who didn’t have any clothes, from evening gowns to bikinis. The bikini was actually of mink … I was floored.”
Although she has previously been quoted describing her marriage as “an atrocious sham”, John O’Rourke, the documentary’s producer-director, told the Observer: “She’s always quite private about this chapter of her life because she had her first child, Victoria, with Sellers … She hasn’t gone into huge amounts of detail. There have been a lot of books and documentary films made about Sellers over the years. She refused to speak to them … She mentioned bipolar disorder. Obviously Britt’s not a medical professional. But she did live with him for four years.”
In the documentary, Ekland says that when she reads her diaries she sees repeated use of the Swedish word for “fight”. She recalls an argument in Rome, after they were harassed by paparazzi: “He just went on and on … This continued all night and he took my radio and smashed it. In the end he called our agent and said, ‘Come and pick her up’. I knew that this time I could never go back.”
The tragedy is that Sellers brought out so much of life’s funny side. In the documentary, one of Milligan’s children recalls: “Dad would have to lie down on his bed to talk to Peter because they’d be laughing so much.”
But Sellers’s grandson Will says: “The sad thing is that, like a lot of comedians, happiness eluded him.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brassic's Joe Gilgun was 'living like Brad Pitt' after landing US role</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brassic’s Joe Gilgun went from squatting to ‘living like Brad Pitt’ when he landed a role in the US drama Preacher.
The former Emmerdale star, 36, played an Irish vampire in four seasons of the big-budget comic book adaptation.
He said it’s so ‘strange’ getting the ‘multi-million dollar’ experience when he travels to Hollywood for work.
Joe told The Sun’s TV Mag: ‘It’s been strange. I go from living like Brad Pitt in these multimillion-dollar things in the States, to coming back to the house I was squatting in, which didn’t even have running water.
‘Everyone was going: “Joe, you’ve got a load of money, you stupid ****, you could have a house!”‘
When Joe – who has bi-polar disorder like his character Vinnie in Brassic – checked his finances he realised he’s minted.
God we hate it when that happens.
The Misfits actor revealed: ‘It turns out I’m f***ing wedged. I’ve had to buy a f***ing house and everything. I don’t want it! I’m happy feeding the pigeons.’
And it looks like things are about to get even better for Joe, what with season two of Brassic hitting our screens soon.
That’s right, Vinnie and the gang are back in May to thieve, bribe and joyride their way through life.
The second series looks set to be even funnier than its predecessor, with Vinnie going undercover after faking his own death.
Aside from the whole death thing (nightmare), the thieves also get threatened for owing £10,000 in cash, with just days to pay it all back.
God, we’re EXCITED.
Brassic returns to Sky and NOW TV in May.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Louis Theroux slices finger off making Jamie Oliver pancake recipe – and he still can’t find it</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOUIS Theroux has managed to slice off part of his finger while trying his hand at making a pancake recipe by Jamie Oliver.
The hit documentary maker has risked his life over the years to make great TV but it seems an encounter with a sharp knife and a red onion has inflicted the most trauma.
Louis Theroux, 49, was trying his hand at a Jamie Oliver recipe for savoury pancakes on Saturday evening when the culinary catastrophe occurred.
The BBC filmmaker shared a photo of his finger heavily bandaged up and a devastated expression on his face to his Instagram followers.
In the caption Louis wrote: “Cut a small slice of my finger off while chopping a red onion for a Jamie Oliver recipe for carrot and coriander pancakes.
“Briefly went pale and had to lie down. Family not impressed by my lack of stoicism. Me too frankly. Still haven’t found the missing piece of finger.”
Celeb chef Jamie Oliver is yet to comment on the missing digit but Louis's other pals sent him comforting words, including
fellow BBC presenter and former One Show host Matt Baker, who joked: “I think the recipe says Ginger not Finger.”
Louis should be a dab hand in the kitchen after starring in BBC's Great Celebrity Bake Off where he had viewers in hysterics as he thrusted into the air during the Stand Up To Cancer special.
The broadcaster was also the first to secure the coveted Paul Hollywood handshake, before Prue Leith followed suit.
Louis then insisted comedian Noel Fielding shake his hand too, which Noel did so reluctantly, deadpanning: "This means nothing."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Celebrity Bake Off star Louis Theroux has sliced off the tip of his finger while attempting to make lunch.
Louis, 49, was trying to whip up carrot and coriander pancakes when the horrible mishap happened.
The documentary filmmaker was chopping up a red onion when he accidentally caught his index finger with the knife.

Louis has since admitted he "went pale" and had to "lie down" following the painful incident.
Taking to Instagram, Louis has shown off his wound, which is now wrapped heavily in a white bandage.
He also admitted he is yet to find the missing piece of his digit. Yuck!
Louis told fans: "Cut a small slice of my finger off while chopping a red onion for a Jamie Oliver recipe for carrot and coriander pancakes.
"Briefly went pale and had to lie down. Family not impressed by my lack of stoicism. "Me too frankly. Still haven’t found the missing piece of finger."
Louis married his long-term girlfriend and mother of his three sons, Nancy Strang, in 2012.
The family now live in the US, having moved there almost three years ago.
Earlier this year, Louis appeared on the celebrity version of The Great British Bake Off for Stand Up To Cancer.
And while on the show, he made history.
Keen cook Louis and his fellow celeb contestants - Jenny Eclair, Ovie Soko and Russell Howard - were tasked with making a giant cookie.
Louis decided to make his pizza-themed, using raspberry icing for the sauce, grated white chocolate for the cheese and dark chocolate drops for the olives.
Judge Paul Hollywood was so impressed that he gave him a handshake. Louis then convinced Prue Leith and Noel Fielding to shake his hand too.
Louis gushed afterwards: "I got three handshakes! That’s never happened before on Bake Off."
Sadly for Louis, this didn't secure him a win. Jenny went on to take the title of Star Baker.

During the show, Louis also admitted he has a"fascination" with Paul Hollywood.
He said: "His eyes...they're like the eyes of an arctic fox, aren't they?"
Louis added: "Why is he called Hollywood? What a ridiculous name."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Louis Theroux ‘slices finger’ while trying Jamie Oliver pancake recipe</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Louis Theroux risked it all while trying his hand at a Jamie Oliver recipe this weekend and ended up ‘slicing off’ part of his finger in the process.
The BBC filmmaker got busy in the kitchen on Saturday night and decided to try one of Jamie’s quirky recipes for savoury pancakes. 
However, it all ended in bloodshed with Louis, 49, sharing a photo of his poor finger bandaged up and a devastated expression on his face. 
‘Cut a small slice of my finger off while chopping a red onion for a Jamie Oliver recipe for carrot and coriander pancakes,’ Louis revealed to his Instagram followers. 
‘Briefly went pale and had to lie down. Family not impressed by my lack of stoicism. Me too frankly. Still haven’t found the missing piece of finger.’ 
While Jamie is yet to respond to Louis’ kitchen nightmare, the documentarian’s followers had plenty to say. 
Former One Show host Matt Baker joked: ‘I think the recipe says Ginger not Finger.’ 
‘That’s the universe’s way of saying you should stick with the lasagne,’ quipped another of Louis’ followers. 
Keen to avoid the recipe themselves, one added: ‘Reasons why not to make carrot and coriander pancakes number 26.’ 
Another fan cried: ‘For Gods sake Louis, stop cooking!!!!’ 
It’s safe to say he’ll probably be ordering take out more often going forward. 
Aside from creating a mess in the kitchen, Louis also opened up about his past interview with Tiger King’s Joe Exotic. 
The pair met in 2011 for Louis’ BBC documentary America’s Most Dangerous Pets before Joe became the single most talked about man on the planet following the Netflix series. 
‘I knew him before he was famous,’ Louis said on The Graham Norton Show. 
‘I spent the best part of a week with him for a documentary on dangerous pets in 2011.’ ‘If I have any regrets, it’s not talking to him more about his two husbands and his rules of engagement for three-person love making!’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Louis Theroux cuts off top of his finger during horror cooking accident</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Louis Theroux was left bandaged up after suffering a cooking accident.
The documentary maker, 49, took to Instagram on Saturday evening to reveal he'd cut off the top of his finger while chopping an onion.
He shared a picture of his injury all wrapped up as he pulled a sad face for the camera looking very sorry for himself.
Louis explained that he'd been following Jamie Oliver's recipe for carrot and coriander pancakes when he had the accident.
The dad-of-three captioned the post: "Cut a small slice of my finger off while chopping a red onion for a Jamie Oliver recipe for carrot and coriander pancakes."
The accident came as a shock and he admitted he had to have a lie down afterwards.
Louis continued: "Briefly went pale and had to lie down.
"Family not impressed by my lack of stoicism. Me too frankly.
"Still haven't found the missing piece of finger."
The fact that he managed to post a selfie seems to suggest he is recovering well from his accident.
Louis has found himself in the headlines again lately thanks to the Netflix series Tiger King.
He was one of the first to interview to the show's leading man Joe Exotic.
Tiger King follows Joe as he ran his zoo full of big cats before he was eventually arrested and jailed for animal cruelty and murder for hire.
Louis interviewed Joe before his imprisonment for America's Most Dangerous Pets in 2011.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cameron Diaz, Scarlett Johansson, Drew Barrymore and more break into epic fist fight for lockdown Boss B***h Challenge</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MARVEL star Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, Margot Robbie, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and more iconic actors have starred in one epic fist-fight challenge, shared on social media.
The challenge sees them all film a scene individually that has then been edited together so that it looks like one extended fight scene.
"I’m so bored! I just want to play with my friends!" says 41-year-old Zoe, kicking off the video as she reads a book.
“Wait a minute, I can play with my friends!" she exclaims, as she walks towards the camera and punching it - with the edit switching to reveal Lucy, 52, who jumps back from the kick and calls out: "What the heck, Zozo?"
Lucy then delivers a punch and the video continues on - although with child stars including Once Upon A Time In Hollywood's Julia Butters also appearing, there are moments where the stuntwomen choose to tickle or let a dog lick the girls, rather than punch a child in the face.
Julia has no such qualms though, and quickly smashes her elbow toward the camera, while Little Women star Florence joins in the fun by picking up a wine bottle before smartly checking herself putting it down and picking up a dog toy to smash into the camera instead.
Margot was clearly inspired by her DC Comics character Harley Quinn as she picks a baseball bat to aim towards the camera.
Halle Berry, 53, meanwhile, falls into a swimming pool before recovering and delivering a punch worthy of any stuntwomen.
Juliette Lewis, Hamilton star Renee Elise Goldberry and Rosario Dawson all also star, while Scottish singer KT Tunstall - whose song The Healer soundtracks the video - appears at the end and asks to be included next time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WATCH: Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson & Cameron Diaz feature in Instagram Fight Club</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Stuntwoman and actress Zoë Bell has created a virtual fight club on Instagram including plenty of famous faces such as Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson, Cameron Diaz and Halle Berry.
The idea may sound a bit outlandish but the all-female fight scene is very well put together and definitely worth a watch.
Bell has labelled the creation '#BossBitchFightChallenge'.
She's known for her work in popular Quentin Tarantino films such as Kill Bill: Volume 1, The Hateful Eight and Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.
Some of the best moments in the five-minute clip include Johansson using a medicine ball as a weapon, Robbie taking a swing with her Harley Quinn baseball bat and Berry taking her shot after falling into a pool.
Enjoy!

    <h5 class="mb-1">#BossBitchFightChallenge Video Is a Star-Studded Melee</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Like all of us, Zoë Bell is starting to get a little bored at home. Unlike most of us, what she’d normally be doing instead of reading a book is kicking ass on screen as a stunt double for folks like Lucy Lawless (Xena: Warrior Princess), Uma Thurman (Kill Bill) and Cate Blanchett (Thor: Ragnarok). The New Zealand stuntwoman and actress, who also played Janet Miller in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Six-Horse Judy in The Hateful Eight, enlisted many of her actor and stuntwomen friends for an Epic #BossBitchFightChallenge set the to KT Tunstall’s “The Healer” that you just have to watch.
Participating brawlers include Lawless, Drew Barrymore, Juliette Lewis, Rosario Dawson, Cameron Diaz, Florence Pugh, Daryl Hannah, Zoe Saldana, Rosie Perez, Thandie Newton, Halle Berry, Scarlett Johansson, Margot Robbie, and many others. And Tunstall has her own cameo at the end.
Bravo, Ms. Bell. We’re glad you got to play with your friends.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hollywood stunt professional Zoe Bell has organized an all-female quarantine fight club, and it’s a star-studded, action-packed affair.
“I’m so bored! I just want to play with my friends!” says Bell, who doubled for Uma Thurman in the “Kill Bill” movies. Tossing aside the book she was reading, she walks up to the camera and declares, “Wait a minute, I can play with my friends!”
With that, she delivers a roundhouse kick aimed at the camera, with Lucy Lawless revealed as the recipient of the blow (Bell was also Lawless’ stunt double for “Xena: Warrior Princess”).
“What the heck, Zo-zo?” asks a ticked-off Lawless as her facial expression shifts from surprise to glee, firing back with a punch assisted by her “Xena” Chakram.
And then more female stars get in on the action. Through the magic of choreographed stunt fighting and clever editing, the end result is a who’s who of Hollywood’s female stars seemingly beating the tar out of each other in what Bell calls the #BossB***hFightChallenge.
Other of the many, many stars involved include Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, Scarlett Johansson, Margot Robbie, Halle Berry, Thandie Netwon and Florence Pugh, who punch, kick and headbutt each other, some gaining assistance fomr an array of props ranging from shovels to sheep.
As the action continues, KT Tunstall’s song “The Healer” plays in the background as the soundtrack to all this mayhem.
“Here it is……! Kicking lockdown boredom with some of the coolest!” wrote Bell to accompany the YouTube video. “Ladies, you are all my heroes.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby's raunchiest Celebrity Juice moments as she quits show</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has officially left Celebrity Juice after 12 whole years of being a team leader on the show.
She made the announcement on Instagram after rumours of her departure had started to circulate on social media.
Sharing a string of pictures covering her time on the show, the 39-year-old confirmed the news to her 6.6million Instagram followers.
The star wrote: ‘Thank you Celebrity Juice for 12 years of fantastic chaos… I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone.
‘Thank you to you all for watching… We’ve always had the loudest and best audiences.’
Since then, Metro.co.uk has decided to look back at some of her best bits and has compiled a list of her raunchiest (and funniest) moments.
One of the most repulsing challenges of the show, Holly and her fellow team leader at the time, Fearne Cotton, were tasked with guessing what kind of smoothie they were drinking.
This time around it was a blend of fish, chips and mushy peas – which are a great combo on their own, but probably not the best when pureed.
Slurping up the substance through a straw, Holly was finding it difficult to get any of the concoction to her lips.
And that made her quip: ‘It’s so thick I can’t get it up.’
Well, the innuendo was just too much for host Keith Lemon, who was bent over in stitches at her response.
Holly and Fearne are not afraid of getting down and dirty, and this is exactly what they did during House of Tongues.
While Keith watched from afar, the duo had to use their tongue (and tongue only) to carry a tiny raisin covered in chocolate from the floor over to a table.
Licking the mat that it was placed on, Holly managed to get one side of the treat while Fearne licked up the other, seeing the girls struggle to make it off the ground.
After a couple of attempt though, they smashed the technique and completed th challenge.
Through no fault of her own, this probably turned out to be one of Holly’s raunchiest moments on the show – and it’s all down to the minds of the viewers are home.
Because what’s so wrong about carrying a banana around an assault course in your mouth?
Jumping through hoops and crouching underneath hurdles, Holly and Fearne managed to complete the challenge with the whole banana in tact.
What champs!
Ant McPartlin had to take a year off presenting I’m A Celebrity: Get Me Out Of Here! following his car crash in 2018.
However, this meant Holly stepped in, and joined Declan Donnally as his new co-host.
But before sending her all the way to Australia, Keith Lemon made sure she was well equipped when it came to Bushtucker Trials.
Forcing her to get used to her new normal, Celeb Juice made their own version of the show, seeing Holly lick chocolate mousse out of a pot while blindfolded.
Keith Lemon told viewers Lick My Baubles was a Christmas present to all those ’16-year-old boys watching’ as he made Holly crouch down and taste the festive decorations.
The aim of the game was for the team leaders (and Michelle Keegan) to guess what festive sauce he’d dipped the baubles in before the show.
While Michelle got a mouthful of cranberries, Fearne was treated to mushed up sprouts.
However, when Holly licked the decs, there was absolutely nothing on them!
‘You’ve got nothing on your baubles, you’re just doing this for s**ts and giggles,’ she told the host – oh Holly, we’re going to miss you!
While it’s not confirmed who is going to replace Holly on the ITV2 show, Michelle Keegan, Emma Bunton and even Eamonn Holmes are key favourites.
Her departure comes after Fearne Cotton also decided to call it quits on the show, seeing Paddy McGuinness take her place as a team leader.
Celebrity Juice continues Thursdays, on ITV2, at 10pm.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby's paid an emotional tribute to her co-stars and fans as she quit Celebrity Juice.
The This Morning star has been a team captain on the ITV2 show - which is fronted by Keith Lemon - since it started more than 12 years ago.
Holly, 39, said in her announcement on Instagram that "all good things must come to an end" and that "nothing lasts for ever."
Alongside a collage of photos from her time on the panel show, she wrote to her 6.6m followers: "Thank you @celebjuiceofficial for 12 years of fantastic chaos...
"I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone.
"Thank you to you all for watching..we’ve always had the loudest and best audiences."
The mum-of-three goes on to say: "It's never felt like work and always been to me like a night out... Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work... all good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever...
"It's time for me to hand over my team captain seat to some lucky lucky person... whoever that is, know you are about to get one of the best jobs in telly working with one of comedies finest... @keithlemon ..."
Paying tribute to the show's host she continued: "Where to begin... I remember starting this journey with you and saying ‘I think this might work’... my goodness me it did... three friends, you me and @fearnecotton ... and that is what is at the heart of it.. friendship... I love the bones of you Lemon!
"Thank you for making me laugh for twelve years... I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check...
"If I don’t see you through a week or next week or the week after... know you are always in my heart...," she ended the post in a nod to Keith's show phrase.
Fearne Cotton, 38, quit the long-running series back in 2018.
Keith responded to the post: "I’m in tears x"
And fans are gutted she's leaving the chaotic show too.
"Won't be the same without you Holly," one said.
Another commented: "Always loved the show! Not been the same without Fearne and will be even worse without you Holly."
"Noooooooooooooooo this can’t be won’t be the same," echoed a third.
Keith had already paid tribute to Holly before her announcement with a rather sweary video clip that he shared on Instagram.
In the short clip, Keith is seen reacting in shock as Holly screamed “F***!” at the camera.
He captioned the video: "Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in. One of the boys but all woman.
"A wicked sense of humour and very easy to look at. Don't look into her eyes though, cos she can make you do anything. What a lady!"
He added: "The one and only @hollywilloughby face of an angel but can have the potty mouth of... well me I guess."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NeNe Leakes just made a lot of fans excited when she announced that she has a new interesting video featuring Jennifer Williams uploaded on her YouTube channel. Check out the video here.
A follower told the RHOA star: ‘Nene you would slay your own talk show! Let’s speak that into existence 🙌🏾‼️’
Someone else was grateful to NeNe for posting this video and said: ‘Thanks for posting because I need to go back to YouTube to finish watching this interview… Nene you are a great interviewer/ host. Your friend Wendy knows that you are capable of doing her job. You’re awesome & inspiring.’
Another commenter said: ‘Bravo wrong for having everybody wear white and leave you out just foul! I’m so happy you changed Greg was 💯percent right!’
Someone else said: ‘Jennifer seems really naive when it comes to men. I’m with NeNe. Why didn’t you just leave the car at someone’s home you trusted like her? When you googled him and he didn’t show up, something should’ve gone off in your head, right at that moment. I’m sorry, but she dropped the ball on that one.’
One other follower posted this message: ‘Jennifer needs to be careful. She is now bringing attention to crime rings including fraudulent activity, auto theft, credit card theft, chop shops etc. Those are dangerous people.’
Another person said that they ‘Never liked Jennifer, but watching her here is making me change my mind. She is classy and tends to listen and allow others to shine. She is definitely not competing for attention.’
One YouTube user said that ‘I like Nene’s advice about ‘allowing a man to choose YOU. My mom has always said, “The man that really wants you ( not necessarily the man YOU initially want) will be the man that treats you the best.” I understood this as I got older. 💕
What do you think about the video?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ellen DeGeneres’ Oscars bodyguard accuses host of being ‘cold, sly and demeaning’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A bodyguard who was hired to protect Ellen DeGeneres at the Oscars has criticised the host for being “kind of demeaning”.
Tom Majercak was looking after DeGeneres as well as her mother and wife Portia de Rossi in 2014, the year Ellen was hosting the awards ceremony,
In an interview with Fox News, he claimed that Ellen was the one celebrity he’s worked with “that has never taken the time to say hi to me”, adding: “And I’ve been assigned to quite a few celebrities.”
Majercak said that things started off well thanks to de Rossi, who he described as “very pleasant”. However, things “started going negatively” when de Rossi introduced him to DeGeneres.
“Ellen pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and didn’t even say ‘hello,’ or ‘thank you for protecting my mother, my wife, and me,’” he continued.
“It was very cold and it was very sly and it was actually kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle.”
Majercak also said that celebrities had to be approved to come and talk to DeGeneres at her table during a high-profile after party.
He said that he came forward with his story after people claiming to be Ellen’s ex-employees shared some startling experiences they’re said to have had with the presenter on social media.
One story claimed that DeGeneres would send her staff at The Ellen DeGeneres Show home if they had failed to chew gum before speaking to her.
Another added: “A new staff member was told ‘every day she picks someone different to really hate. It’s not your fault, just suck it up for the day and she’ll be mean to someone else the next day.’ They didn’t believe it but it ended up being entirely true.”
“It’s bugged me for years,” Majercak said. “I see this person come across as being very enlightened and positive and awesome and everybody loves her and is in awe, and that’s really not the case when you meet her in person.”
A representative for DeGeneres has been contacted for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ellen DeGeneres’ former bodyguard slams her as ‘cold’ and ‘demeaning’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ellen DeGeneres’ former bodyguard has slammed her as “cold” and “demeaning”.
Tom Majercak was hired to protect the talk show host while she hosted the 2014 Oscars, and he also shadowed Ellen’s mother, and her wife Portia de Rossi.
Speaking to Fox News, Tom said it was one of the worst jobs he’s ever signed up for, in the ten years he’s worked in security.
He said: “Ellen is the one person that I’ve been assigned to, and I’ve been assigned to quite a few celebrities, that has never taken the time to say hi to me.”
Although Tom said Portia was “very pleasant and carried on a conversation”, he couldn’t say the same for Ellen.
He said: “[She] pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and didn’t even say ‘hello,’ or ‘thank you for protecting my mother, my wife and me.’”
“It was very cold and it was very sly and it was actually kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle.”
“It’s bugged me for years. I see this person come across as being very enlightened and positive and awesome. And everybody loves her and is in awe and that’s really not the case when you meet her in person,” he said.
“When you see her on TV, people fall in love with her but it is a false facade and bravado. You start hearing these stories and I was like, ‘Man, there’s got to be more to this.’
“She’s not the person she portrays to be that she’s playing off of society. That’s my opinion,” he added.
The news comes after Ellen was criticised by staff members over lack of communication about their pay amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Production on The Ellen Show halted in March, and Ellen has since been hosting the show from her house.
A source told Variety: “Radio silence from producers created anxiety among crew members who feared they would be furloughed and, in that case, would need to explore unemployment benefits.”
Staff were also furious over Ellen hiring a non-union company to help her produce the show from her house, when her usual crew members have the same skills and are currently out of work.
The chat show host also hit headlines for all the wrong reasons last month, when YouTube star NikkieTutorials called her “cold” after she appeared on The Ellen Show earlier this year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A bodyguard who looked after Ellen DeGeneres at the 2014 Academy Awards has spoken out about the talk show host, saying that the experience of working with her was “kind of demeaning.”
Bodyguard Tom Majercak said that he was hired to guard Ellen, her mother and her wife Portia de Rossi at the ceremony, which she was hosting, and at events before and after.
He told Fox News that he has worked with a number of high-profile clients but that he did not find the talk show host to be especially friendly.
“Ellen is the one person that I’ve been assigned to – and I’ve been assigned to quite a few celebrities – that has never taken the time to say hi to me,” he said.
He said that he and Portia de Rossi carried on a pleasant and friendly conversation but that things “started going negatively” when he spoke to the host. He continued:
He claimed that he was inspired to say something about his experience after seeing various stories about Ellen circulating online in recent months:
Dutch beauty YouTuber Nikkie de Jager, otherwise known as NikkieTutorials, recently spoke about her own experience on Ellen’s show, calling her “cold and distant.”
Let’s also never forget this iconic interview with Dakota Johnson, in which the pair squared off about whether the hos was or was not invited to Johnson’s birthday party:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Eddie Marsan recruits family to film TV scenes during lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Eddie Marsan has tackled the challenge of appearing in a new TV series while in lockdown by recruiting his family as film crew and performers.
The Happy Go Lucky star and his wife Janine juggled home-schooling their four children while capturing his scenes for ITV’s Isolation Stories, a four-part drama about families during the coronavirus pandemic.
Covid-19 outbreak restrictions saw Janine step behind the camera for the first time to help capture her husband’s performance while two of their children joined in the acting.
Marsan – whose career has seen him directed by Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and Mike Leigh – hailed his wife’s directorial debut.
He told the BBC Andrew Marr show on Sunday: “She was fantastic, she really took it on. She was moving the cameras, moving the lights, doing the sounds, cooking the lunches, everything.”
Janine explained she was given technical support by director David Blair and others via the video conferencing platform Zoom, but said she did not think she would start a new film career.
Marsan explained that he is due to appear in an episode entitled Karen, which sees him play a “heartbroken” man whose marriage has collapsed and is self-isolating at home with his two teenage sons.
His ex-partner’s father, played by actor David Threlfall, comes to his house to persuade him to let his former wife see the children.
Due to strict social-distancing rules, Threlfall had to remain in the Marsan family garden while performing his scenes.
“The whole premise is to tell stories about what’s happening in everyday people’s lives but within the context of isolation and the difficulties that that brings,” Marsan explained.
He said his children had grown up on film sets and he thought the challenge of helping film scenes at home would teach them to collaborate.
“They loved it. It was very hard work and they wanted to get off their school work, but we didn’t let them,” he said.
“So every time we said ‘cut’ and we had to change things, they had to go down and do some more work, and they wanted to just play on the Xbox or something. We didn’t let them.”
Isolation Stories airs at 9pm over four nights on ITV, starting on Monday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Eddie Marsan recruits family to film TV scenes during lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Eddie Marsan has tackled the challenge of appearing in a new TV series while in lockdown by recruiting his family as film crew and performers.
The Happy Go Lucky star and his wife Janine juggled home-schooling their four children while capturing his scenes for ITV’s Isolation Stories, a four-part drama about families during the coronavirus pandemic.
Covid-19 outbreak restrictions saw Janine step behind the camera for the first time to help capture her husband’s performance while two of their children joined in the acting.
Marsan – whose career has seen him directed by Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and Mike Leigh – hailed his wife’s directorial debut.
He told the BBC Andrew Marr show on Sunday: “She was fantastic, she really took it on. She was moving the cameras, moving the lights, doing the sounds, cooking the lunches, everything.”
Janine explained she was given technical support by director David Blair and others via the video conferencing platform Zoom, but said she did not think she would start a new film career.
Marsan explained that he is due to appear in an episode entitled Karen, which sees him play a “heartbroken” man whose marriage has collapsed and is self-isolating at home with his two teenage sons.
His ex-partner’s father, played by actor David Threlfall, comes to his house to persuade him to let his former wife see the children.
Due to strict social-distancing rules, Threlfall had to remain in the Marsan family garden while performing his scenes.
“The whole premise is to tell stories about what’s happening in everyday people’s lives but within the context of isolation and the difficulties that that brings,” Marsan explained.
He said his children had grown up on film sets and he thought the challenge of helping film scenes at home would teach them to collaborate.
“They loved it. It was very hard work and they wanted to get off their school work, but we didn’t let them,” he said.
“So every time we said ‘cut’ and we had to change things, they had to go down and do some more work, and they wanted to just play on the Xbox or something. We didn’t let them.”
Isolation Stories airs at 9pm over four nights on ITV, starting on Monday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rebel Wilson Rocks See-Through Mesh Shirt & Shows Off Dance Moves For TikTok Challenge</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It truly feels like TikTok is taking over the world! Some of our favorite celebrities have been posting hilarious videos on the app — and Rebel Wilson is no exception. The Aussie actress took to the social media platform on May 3 to share a funny clip of herself starting a duet fight. The 40-year-old Pitch Perfect star’s dance challenge was set to the tune of Shakira‘s hit “Hips Don’t Lie”, and she encouraged her fans to get in on the fun. “Duet me on TikTok if you dare! Let’s see who is victorious!,” she captioned the clip.
The duet function on the video sharing app allows users to take another person’s video and add to it their own clip, either reacting to it, or recreating it. Props to Rebel for creativity! In the clip she wore a purple, see-through mesh top over a black bra, and allowed her blonde locks to fall above her shoulders in pretty curls. It comes one day after the Cats actor posted a series of snaps showing off her slimmed-down figure in a light blue tracksuit. “I call this series: At Home with Rebel,” she captioned the carousel post, in which she wore pants and an unzipped hoodie, exposing her black bra.
In the first snap, she totally looked like a model as she posed on top of her chic white sofa, and smized like a pro! In the second pic, the Pitch Perfect actress stood in front of her camera with her leg popped out to the size and her blonde tresses styled into pretty curls, falling below her shoulders. Finally, she channeled her now-iconic role in Cats for the third pic as she crawled towards the camera. Rebel’s personal trainer Jono Castano Acero applauded her self-timer shoot and commented “yes” along with several fire emojis.
The Aussie star recently got in an intense outside workout, going toe-to-toe with Jono at a park in Sydney. After exercising with some workout bands, Rebel strapped on her boxing gloves for a sparring session. After losing so much weight before COVID-19, it appears Rebel wasn’t going to let a pandemic ruin her workout routine. Rebel revealed her dramatic 40-pound weight loss at the 2019 premiere of Muriel’s Wedding: The Musical in Melbourne, Australia. Ever since then, she has basked in the glory of her hard work with every public appearance.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With each passing day, it’s crystal clear that megastar Chiranjeevi is taking Twitterati on his own stride dominating all the other young heroes who were ruling the roost till the megastar’s entry.
By the way, don’t miss checking the latest video he uploaded on his Twitter wall. It was a dance video of the 10th reunion celebration of 1980s club and Chiranjeevi was dancing out his heart with yesteryear heroines having all the fun.
The throwback dance video has all the elements to go viral with an immediate effect. When Chiru joined Twitter, there were mixed reactions and there were a few voices asking if he needs all the negativity and trolls at this age.
It’s easy to fall prey to nasty trolls and then, the negativity can actually hurt. In no time, Chiranjeevi proved that he can handle Twitter like a pro and since then, he has been dominating all the young heroes.
We must agree that his social media PR team has been perfectly doing a great job. Being witty and spontaneous seems to be the mantra behind the megastar’s instant connection with the Twitterati. That’s why boss is boss!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">K-Pop idol Lisa’s legs is the latest quarantine meme to hit the internet.
The BlackPink member accidentally started a whole new internet ‘Did it Work?’ meme, crediting her thigh-high leather boots featured in a sultry dance cover of 6lack and Quin’s 2019 single ‘Mushroom Chocolate’ released on her personal YouTube channel.
Users soon jumped on the hilarious meme bandwagon by screenshotting her dance performance and cropping themselves, or other public figures, side-by-side to the K-Pop artist’s pair of thigh-high boots.
High-profile celebrities like Dolly Parton, Luke Evans, Stephen Colbert, Lil Nas X, and James Corden have also similarly taken part of the current meme craze and captioned “Did it Work?” in their posts.
In just a week, her video performance choreographed by Cheshir Ha and filmed by Anthony King has already amassed 17 million views.
Known for her dancing skills, YG Entertainment’s first non-Korean artist has been regularly posting dance covers on her YouTube account.
The Thailand-born rapper and dancer was a trainee under YG Entertainment before making her debut as a BlackPink member in August 2016. She is reportedly the most-followed K-Pop star on Instagram, amassing a whopping 32.4 million followers.
Aside from her group activities, Lisa is currently a mentor on Chinese talent show, ‘Youth With You’, alongside Cai Xukun, Jony J, and Ella Chen.
While Blinks are looking forward to solo music from Lisa, they are anticipating BlackPink’s collaboration with Lady Gaga.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Loose Women rehearse for return of ITV daytime stalwart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Loose Women presenters have rehearsed for the return of the TV show after six weeks away.
The panellists met this weekend to get ready for the new programmes, starting on ITV on Monday.
The daytime show, which came off screen because of the coronavirus pandemic, returns with social distancing measures in place.
Three women are on an extended panel, two metres apart, with a fourth panellist appearing via video-link.
Monday’s first live show will see Andrea McLean, Brenda Edwards and Nadia Sawalha on the panel with Coleen Nolan joining via video-link.
McLean said: “Loose Women has been a part of my life for 13 years, so to suddenly not be meeting up with my friends, catching up over a latte and hearing the latest about what’s going on in their lives has been really strange.
“As the whole world will agree – chatting over video call just isn’t the same.
“I can’t wait to get back to work, get back into the studio and give our lovely viewers some much-needed love and laughter at lunchtime.”
Nolan said: “Although we won’t have our lovely live audience there for a little while longer, we promise to still make them smile at home.”
Loose Women returns on Monday at 12.30pm on ITV.

Monday’s first live show will see Andrea McLean, Brenda Edwards and Nadia Sawalha on the panel with Coleen Nolan joining via video-link.
McLean said: “Loose Women has been a part of my life for 13 years, so to suddenly not be meeting up with my friends, catching up over a latte and hearing the latest about what’s going on in their lives has been really strange.
“As the whole world will agree – chatting over video call just isn’t the same.
“I can’t wait to get back to work, get back into the studio and give our lovely viewers some much-needed love and laughter at lunchtime.”
Nolan said: “Although we won’t have our lovely live audience there for a little while longer, we promise to still make them smile at home.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Film fans prepare to ‘feel the force’ on Star Wars Day</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Movie fans around the world are preparing to mark Star Wars Day.
The day is celebrated on May 4 each year with aficionados wearing costumes to show their love of the sci-fi franchise.
Fans refer to the movies’ famous phrase May The Force Be With You by declaring “May the Fourth be with you”.
Last year, after the death of Chewbacca actor Peter Mayhew, his family shared a special message, saying that “May the 4th is a tribute to the scale of Star Wars reach”.
Entertainment giant Disney+ is putting the final instalment in the Skywalker saga, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, on its platform on the day.
The Rise Of Skywalker was released in December and featured a star-studded cast including Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Adam Driver.
It received mixed reviews from critics and holds a 52% score on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes.
The film earned just over one billion dollars at the global box office, making it less successful than both The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joe Wicks 'feeling fantastic' after operation and vows he's 'back in the game'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Wicks has admitted he’s feeling ‘fantastic’ after having surgery on his hand and shared an update from his hospital bed.
The Body Coach had been admitted to Kingston Hospital in London over a painful injury and underwent an operation to repair it after falling off a bike, but he’s now fighting fit and rearing to get back to keeping the globe healthy during coronavirus lockdown.
‘Good morning everybody, I feel fantastic,’ Joe said in a video posted on his Instagram Stories.
‘The antibiotics have well and truly kicked in. The inflammation and the swelling has gone right down.’
He then wiggled his fingers and joked he might now write some emails and play the guitar.
‘I’m back in the game so see you Monday morning for some nose-picking,’ Joe added.
Joe revealed that he will be returning to his PE session next week, with the 33-year-old previously telling his followers: ‘See you Monday for PE with Joe.’
He also explained that his wife, Rosie, will be helping him for the upcoming session, as he might not be able to showcase many exercises due to his injury, but he ‘doesn’t want to let anyone down’.
‘I’ve just asked my lovely wife Rosie to help me with #pewithjoe on Monday morning and she’s kindly agreed,’ he said, as he posted a picture of Rosie with their son, Marley, to his story.
‘It’s well out of her comfort zone but she’s my best friend and she knows how much this means to me.
‘I don’t want to let anyone down but I don’t think I’m going to be able to demo many exercises so I’ll be having Rosie on camera with me.
‘I’ll still lead the session and coach you through it. I’ll just have Rosie demonstrating the moves.’

“The wires have been taken out…. it was infected,” he said in a video on Instagram Stories.
“I’m staying in tonight to have…  antibiotics and a bit more paracetamol then I’ll be home tomorrow morning, back to my family.
“So see you Monday morning, PE With Joe.”
Earlier, Wicks, who is donating the money raised from his online PE lessons to the NHS, posted a video of himself “gowned up” with “the socks on” and waiting for his operation.
He said the pain from the “infection” in his hand was “throbbing and pulsating like liquid hot magma”.
Wicks said he was “super grateful for the health system we’ve got” and “the NHS people who are out here still grafting”.
Wicks also said his wife would help out on Monday.
“I’ve just asked my lovely wife Rosie to help me on Monday morning and she’s kindly agreed,” he said.
“It’s well out of her comfort zone but she’s my best friend and she knows how much this means to me.
“I don’t want to let anyone down but I don’t think I’m going to be able to demo many exercises so I’ll be having Rosie on camera with me.”
Wicks added: “I’ll still lead the session and coach you through it.
“I’ll just have Rosie demonstrating the moves.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Hemsworth thanks fans for watching 'Extraction' on Netflix</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3 (UPI) -- Chris Hemsworth thanked viewers this weekend in an Instagram video for watching his new Netflix original movie, Extraction.
"Hey, what's up guys? I hope you're doing well," the action-thriller's star said in Saturday's post.
"I just want to say a massive 'thank you' to everyone who checked out Extraction. You've made it the No. 1 film on the planet right now, and it looks like it's going to be Netflix's biggest feature film of all time, which is absolutely mind-blowing," he added.
"On behalf of myself, the Russo Brothers, Netflix, our director Sam Hargrave, thank you so, so much. We love you guys."
The streaming service tweeted Friday: "EXTRACTION is well on its way to becoming the biggest-ever film premiere on Netflix -- with a projected 90 million households getting in on the action in the first 4 weeks. Thanks to everyone who watched so far!"
Hemsworth, who is famous for playing Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, previously worked with the Russos on Avengers movies.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here Are the Best Twitter Reactions to Netflix's Extraction</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Extraction, which premiered on Netflix on April 24, is on its way to becoming the most-watched feature film on the streaming service. On Saturday, Hemsworth released a video statement on his Instagram account, with the following message:
"Hey what’s up guys?," he starts."Hope you're doing well. I just want to say a massive thank you to everyone that checked out Extraction. You've made it the #1 film on the planet right now."
Netflix also issued a statement expressing their gratitude to fans: "Extraction is well on its way to becoming the biggest-ever film premiere on Netflix—with a projected 90 million households getting in on the action in the first 4 weeks," the company wrote. "Thanks to everyone who watched so far!"
So now that we know everyone is freaking out about this film enough to make it the No. 1 movie people are watching, it's time to look into all the hype on Twitter. First, it's important to know that this film is about a black-market mercenary named Tyler Rake who is hired to rescue the kidnapped son of an international crime lord. Obviously, this is a pretty risky, deadly mission, but action movies about deadly missions seem right up Chris Hemsworth's alley.
Hemsworth is obviously feeling the love that people have for his latest big hit. He tweeted that he woke up to find that his Instagram account was absolutely blowing up with likes. "Woke up to a notification saying my new IG acct got put on hold due to unusual activity. Do I already regret this???," he wrote.
Let's take a look at all of this Extraction social media action; maybe this round-up will help the movie's star keep track of all the love he's getting.
According to Hemsworth's Instagram story, this is how we should all wish Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson a happy birthday today:
Genius.

    <h5 class="mb-1">[BREAKING] Uncharted 4: Nathan Fillion Is Nathan Drake In Deepfake! Watch it Now!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Remember that deepfake starring Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Holland in Back To The Future? Here's another deepfake... This time, Nathan Fillion stars in Uncharted 4, and it is nothing short than amazingly done.

It's simple really, a deepfake creator, who calls himself as Jarkan has done amazing work with recapturing Nathan Fillion as Nathan Drake in the Uncharted franchise.
They do have some resemblance, and it looks like Jarkan has seen through it as well, hence him doing what he did with poor old Nathan Drake's digital face and replacing it with Fillion's chiseled looks.
Jarkan's work shows what deepfake software can do, and this video is a proof. It is able to swap out a face with another with the help of artificial intelligence as well as a deep learning machine. The arrival of the software is met with mixed reviews because it can cause a great deal of concern, especially for ethical reasons as well as fraud.

Of course, there are other more sinister things people can do with the software like previously swapping out Emma Watson for an adult actress and more.
While Jarkan's work is truly a work of art, it shows that if ever producers would think of making a real-life action movie of the franchise, the obvious choice for the main actor would be, of course, Nathan Fillion. The Firefly and Castle star has always been touted as the man to play the role for Drake in any Uncharted movie. Fun fact, even the actor himself is a big fan of the game, so it doesn't seem far off for him to cast his ballot for that fictional role.
Without further ado, here's the video of that deep fake starring Nathan Dra..err Fillion in the Uncharted 4 clip.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Who could forget Cat Valentine of Victorious and Sam & Cat? On Saturday, Ariana Grande remembered her Nickelodeon days, after taking home an award for Favorite Female Artist during Nickelodeon'sKid Choice Awards 2020: Celebrate Together.The singer used her video acceptance speech to thank fans for their ongoing support, but also to acknowledge the special role the network has played in her career.
Grande began her video by shouting out fans who voted for her, saying, "I just wanted to thank you so, so, so much for making me your favorite female music star, I'm very appreciative." The Sweetener singer added a special message about the network as well, saying, "Nickelodeon always will hold such a tremendous place in my heart, not only because of Victorious and Sam & Cat and the amazing years I spent working with them, but also just for SpongeBob, you know?"
The 2020 Kids Choice Awards televised event was one of the first award shows to air during the COVID-19 pandemic, which prohibits large gatherings of people and forced winners and presenters to participate remotely, as per Billboard. Victoria Justice, who co-starred with Grande on Victorious, hosted the virtual event, welcoming guests such as Dwayne Johnson, JoJo Siwa, Ellen DeGeneres, and more.
The Kids Choice Awards win was a full circle moment for Grande's career. Nickelodeon's sitcoms served as a launchpad for the singer's music career, as Grande was cast in Victorious in 2010, and recorded music for the popular series, as per IMDB. Later, Grande also appeared in spin-off series Sam & Cat, which aired in 2013.
Grande's KCA acceptance speech is not the first time the star has opened up about her television career. In 2014, Grande reflected on Sam & Cat after the show was canceled, saying of her character, "I admire her so much," in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. She added that she always loved how Cat had an, "appreciation for life and everybody she encounters" as well as "passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread." Grande added: "She always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good."
It's been many years since Grande appeared on either sitcom, but Cat Valentine had a role in making her the mega-star she is today. Never one to miss an opportunity to thank her dedicated fans (or shout out SpongeBob), the singer's acceptance speech hit the right note for the event.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nick Kids' Choice Awards 2020: 7 Moments That Stuck Like Slime</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We might be in the middle of a pandemic but a little thing like a global health crisis can't stop the slime. On Saturday (May 2), the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards took place with Victoria Justice hosting a remote evening of blimps, winners and green goo.
From showers to SpongeBob, these were the top seven moments of Nick Kids' Choice Awards: Celebrate Together.
Couples Goals
Shawn Mendes (winner of favorite male artist) showed up with Camila Cabello to accept the favorite music collaboration award for their duet "Señorita." "I've literally watched the Kids' Choice Awards for years and I wish I could get slimed!" Cabello said from quarantine with Mendes. "We're gonna make organic slime right now and slime ourselves." Share the recipe, CC. We're ready.
Giving Back
Host Victoria Justice announced that Nickelodeon was donating a million dollars to No Kid Hungry to help in these difficult times. Which is awesome -- and even better that she delivered the news holding a sweet lil pup. Respect.
Frozen in the Shower
Kristen Bell, decked out in costume Anna realness, appeared during the broadcast alongside dolls of various Frozen 2 characters. As did Josh Gad, who walked out of his bathroom in a pink shower cap to accept his blimp. As Olaf's human voice put it, "This is the closest I'm gonna get to air transportation right now."
NBA? N-B-Yay!
LeBron James, his beard in full effect, showed up to accept the award for favorite male sports star. "You guys are amazing, this has always been one of the best shows to be a part of. Stay safe and healthy," he said.
Take a Bow
JoJo Siwa, who hopped into the pool after winning a blimp, held nothing back during the KCAs, not just dousing herself in slime but brushing her teeth with the iconic Nickelodeon slime. You think that's nothing? Okay, do it yourself.
SpongeBob Social-Distancing Pants
The voices of SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star (Tom Kenny and Bill Fagerbakke, respectively) appeared to accept the award for favorite animated series, and watching the real-life humans adopting their cartoon voices on camera was a total delight. "We're in this together!" said Kenny in character, before adding, "But Squidward is in this alone."
A Grande Entrance
Victoria Justice shouted out former Victorious castmate Ariana Grande, who won the favorite female music star award. "I'm very appreciative. Nickelodeon will always hold such a tremendous place in my heart not just for Victorious and Sam and Cat and the years I spent working with them. But also just for SpongeBob, you know? I'm always very honored." Agreed. Truly, we are all lucky to exist in the same timeline as SpongeBob SquarePants.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JoJo Siwa, 16, was the highlight of the Nickelodeon’s Kids’ Choice Awards 2020: Celebrate Together special! The teen just re-defined being “slimed” — the signature occurrence at every KCAs — and it was epic. As JoJo made her way through her family home, she just couldn’t get away from the goopy green substance! The sequence got off to a bang as JoJo woke up to a text that said “Happy Slime Day,” lifting her head off of a slime-soaked pillow! “Hmm, I wonder what that means?” she exclaimed, giving fans a glimpse at her colorful, candy-filled bedroom! We were particularly loving her gum ball printed desk that made a cameo in the opening scene, acting as a shelf for her sweet candy “laboratory.”
As the blonde made her way to her bathroom, it appeared even her toothpaste had been replaced by the gross slime! Easy going JoJo rolled with the punches, and proceeded to scrub away at those pearly whites, green goop and all. From there, she went to her arcade toy machine (seriously, can we move into this house?) and finally got one of the toys with the impossible-to-use robotic arm. As the plush bear made it’s way out of the machine, JoJo was disappointed to discover it, too, was doused in slime. “What? How is everything slime?” she exclaimed, figuring out what “Slime Day” meant.
The teenager appeared to be producing her own slime at one point, as it began leaking out of her mouth after she sipped on water — yikes! As if that wasn’t enough, JoJo got completely doused outside — luckily — right in front of her swimming pool! “Happy Slime Day, everybody!” she screamed as she jumped into the water. As always, JoJo rocked her sassy side ponytail and colorful bow — by the way, she now has her very own line called JoJo’s Bow Club — and a colorful ensemble! She didn’t disappoint with her silver glitter sunglasses and bedazzled orange t-shirt, accessorizing with a bright green bow.
Later in the show, JoJo was honored with a blimp of her very own in the Favorite Social Media star category! “Hey, JoJo, what’s that at the bottom of the pool?” a female voice asked her off-screen. JoJo then — once again — dove right into the pool to fish out the award! “I won a Kids’ Choice Award!” she screamed from the pool. “Wow, this is crazy. Oh my gosh, this is my first Kids’ Choice Award and I want to thank you guys so, so much for voting for me, for always supporting me!…Even though times are hard right now, it’s only going to make life bigger and better!” she added.
Many A-Listers have had the — erm — honor of being slimed over the years, with the tradition dating way back to 1988! Halle Berry was hilariously and unsuspectingly doused in the sticky goop back in 2012, joining the ranks with Ben Affleck, Will Smith, Katy Perry, Pink, and more! Multiple celebs were surprised with slime on last years’ broadcast, including YouTube star David Dobrik, Adam Sandler, dad-to-be Chris Pratt, and DJ Khaled!
The Kids Choice Awards were originally scheduled to air on Mar. 22, however, were postponed due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The re-scheduled version, hosted by former Nickelodeon star Victoria Justice, looked like a very different production as talent participated from their own homes. The star-studded event also served as a fundraiser for those in need, donating an incredible $1 million to organization No Kid Hungry.
Other than JoJo, Camila Cabello, Ariana Grande, David Dobrik and Millie Bobby Brown made appearances on the colorful broadcast, bringing the party right along with them! LeBron James was also honored for his work in education with the Generation Change Award.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just like all other public places, the gyms too are shut during the lockdown leaving fitness enthusiasts stranded. But Priyanka Chopra Jonas seems to have found a rather cute way to keep working those muscles. While not the biggest fan of workouts, Priyanka has figured a way to tone up while at home.
PeeCee shared a video on social media doing some lifts. However, instead of weights, she was lifting up her cute little niece, Krishna Sky Sarkisian. She captioned the video, "No gym, no problem.”
Priyanka is very close to her niece and we keep seeing her adorable videos and pictures that she shares on social media. Well, it looks like the actress has figured out another fun way to spend time with Krishna.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aww! Disha Patani and her boyfriend Tiger Shroff’s mother Ayesha Shroff’s social media banter over the former’s per dog is simply adorable
Just like Tiger Shroff, his rumoured girlfriend Disha Patani shares an amazing bond with his mother Ayesha and sister Krishna as well. We often come across Disha’s delightful social media banter with the Shroffs and it’s always a sight to behold. This time, however, the Bharat actress and Ayesha Shroff bonded over the former’s four-legged buddy, Goku. It all happened after Disha shared a happy video of her pooch jumping around the lawn in joy. Ayesha was quick to take notice and compliment the cutie.
The video sees Disha Patani’s pet dog Goku excitedly jumping in her lawn and playing with the grass. Needless to say, Goku, just like most of the dogs, was elated to head out. Disha in her caption wrote, “My goku #postlockdown.” Tiger’s mom Ayesha Shroff was pretty impressed with Goku, as she wrote, “He’s the cuuuuuuuuutest,” followed by lots of smiling and heart emoticons. The Malang actress was quick to reciprocate by leaving a couple of hearts under Ayesha’s comment.
Prior to this, Disha Patani had shared a sizzling BTS from Baaghi 3, which impressed Ayesha and Krishna to bits. The mother-daughter duo also left some compliments under Disha’s post.
Check them out:
Meanwhile, Disha, in an interview, revealed how the Baaghi franchise has helped her come a long way in Bollywood. She was quoted saying, “From sharpening my dancing skills to finally having a solo performance in 'Baaghi 3', the franchise has helped me come a long way. I am very grateful to be a part of the Baaghi family again.” (ALSO READ - Are Disha Patani And Tiger Shroff Really Living Together During Lockdown?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drake on posting pictures of his son: ‘I wanted to free myself’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Drake has finally opened up about the reason he shared pictures of his son online, after keeping him out of the public eye for the first two years of his life.
Last month the Canadian rapper took to Instagram to share pictures of his blonde, curly haired and blue-eyed toddler Adonis, who he parents with former adult star Sophie Brussaux.
Now, he reveals to Lil Wayne why he chose to end the secrecy.
“It wasn’t even anything I talked to anybody about or anything I planned. I just woke up one morning, and I was like, you know what? This is just something that I want to do,” said Drake.
“I want to be able to go places with my son and share memories with my son. I don’t want to feel like just because of a life choice I made to be a ‘celebrity’ that I got to make everybody live under this blanket. I just wanted to free myself of that.”
The rapper said it was “great for me” to be able to do that. His comments aired on the second episode of ‘Young Money Radio’, Lil Wayne’s show.
The world first learnt of Drake’s son in 2018, when rapper Pusha T released a diss track against him titled ‘The Story of Adidon’, exposing that Drake had been hiding a child.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Is it Morally Correct For Lil Win To Make Money From Late Bernard Nyarko’s Death By Just Crying On Youtube?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“Bishop Bernard Nyarko is dead and I’m going to cry, but before I do that, I need you to record me doing it so I can put it on Youtube, that way at least I can make some money from it”-– we guess that was the idea that popped into Lil Win’s head when he heard the news of the death of his colleague actor.
It’s been already confirmed that A-list Kumawood actor Bernard Nyarko is dead and while several Ghanaians are mourning him, Lil Win who is also an actor decided to mourn him differently by making some money out of it while doing so.
Lil Win has uploaded an 8-minute long video of him mourning the actor on his Youtube channel and it’s sparked a debate about whether it is “morally correct” to do something like that, considering the fact that, he actually “acted” the whole scene.

I mean I’m not saying those tears are fake, but to get time to wear red cloth, get a camera in front of you, and then begin to cry and after that have that energy to upload it on your Youtube channel, and ‘MONETIZE” it seriously begs the genuineness of those tears.
A friend is dead for Christ sake, this is not the time to shed some crocodile tears (well that’s what he’s led me to think) and upload it on your Youtube Channel.
Well, the video has garnered some 70,000 plus views at the time of this post, and if he doesn’t gather the decency to take it down, the views will keep rising.
Some fans of his who were shocked by his actions wrote that in comments.
 
So it is morally correct? Share your thoughts in comments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drake Opens Up About The Reason He Finally Decided To Introduce His Son Adonis To The World Two Years After Welcoming Him!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During a chat with Lil Wayne on the newest episode of ‘Young Money Radio,’ Drake opened up about parenthood as well as his new music. The rapper explained, among other things, why he finally decided to introduce his son, Adonis to the world!
As you probably remember, Drake took everyone by surprise when he shared the first pics of his child after previously trying to keep him more of a secret.
Also as a complete surprise, he dropped his mixtape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes not too long ago so during his sit down with the fellow rapper, Drake made sure to talk about the tracks while also discussing his role as a dad to his 2-year-old son, Adonis.
The hitmaker posted the very first pics of the toddler on his Instagram account on March 30 and now he dished that ‘It was great for me. It was great to share that with the world and just felt like … It was not even anything I talked to anyone about or anything that I planned. I just woke up one morning and was like, ‘you know what? This is something that I want to do.’ I wanna be able to go places with my son and to share memories with my son.’
‘I do not want to feel like because of the life choice I made to be a ‘celebrity’ that I have to make everyone live under this blanket too. So, I wanted to free myself of that. And I’ve watched you [Lil Wayne] be a functioning rap father for years, an incredible father,’ he went on to say.
Drake also mentioned that other rappers, including Lil Wayne himself, have inspired him to always strive to be a great dad.
‘A lot of the guys that we came up around [were] great family men on those tours and on those long studio nights when albums need to get done,’ he mentioned in part.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drake 'feels great' sharing son with the world as he opens up on fatherhood</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Drake revealed he felt ‘great’ sharing his son with the world.
The rapper confirmed back in June 2018 that he had son Adonis, with Sophie Brussaux, and he explained it felt ‘freeing’ to be able to tell everyone.
Speaking to fellow rapper Lil Wayne on Young Money Radio, he said: ‘It was great for me. It was great to just share that with the world and I just felt like… it wasn’t even anything I talked to anybody about or anything I planned.
‘I just woke up one morning and I was like, you know what? This is just something that I want to do.’
‘I want to be able to go places with my son and share memories with my son. I don’t want to feel like just because of a life choice I made to be a ‘celebrity’ that I got to make everybody live under this blanket.
‘So, I just wanted to free myself of that.’
Drake later stated that it was ‘inspiring’ to see his labelmates, such as Lil Wayne, being able to focus on music and look after their children at the same time, and has credited the Young Money record label for allowing him to do the same.
‘I’ve watched you be a functioning rap father for years, an incredible father,’ he told Wayne. ‘And that gave me a lot of confidence too.
‘A lot of us, like [2] Chainz, is a great father and a lot of the guys that we came up around just being great family men on those yours and on those long studio nights when albums need to get done.
‘But specifically you, just how you always just made that s**t function and work and how much love the people in your life have for you.’
He added: ‘And I could just tell the way your kids would stare at you that the time and effort that you put in as a father.
‘So, that was really inspiring for me just to know that I can still keep pushing forward as a musician and be there for my son.’
In the meantime, Drake has released an album of leaks and one-off tracks called the Dark Line Demo Tapes – and has teased he could drop a new studio album this summer.
He’s really spoiling us.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Elton John is reflecting about life in quarantine while speaking with Zane Lowe on “Beats 1”.
“I’ve never lived like anything like this in my lifetime,” Elton said of the COVID-19 pandemic however he is looking at the silver lining that hopefully, it will bring everyone together.
“No matter what political party you are on, you have to listen to what [the experts] tell you,” he added.
The famed musician is isolating with husband David Furnish and sons Zachary, 9, and Elijah, 7, where they play Snakes and Ladders every weekend.
“To be honest with you, it has been great to spend this much time with my boys,” he continued. “It’s 24/7 with them and it’s been fantastic.”
He then joked, “I’m saying that after a week. Check on me in about three weeks.”
Elton did express that he is “saddest” about all the musicians and crew who live “month to month” that are suffering during this time. “I’m very lucky.”
He also had some advice for all the young people who, like him once, think they are “invincible.”
“This is a different situation that has ever happened before. You have to be very careful. Stick with your family…cherish it while you can,” he mused. “It gives us a chance to reflect on what life is all about…coming together as one is what I hope will be the result of all of this.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drake Reveals Why He Finally Decided To Post Photos Of Son Adonis, 2: ‘It Was Great For Me’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Drake surprised us all when he dropped his mixtape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes, and he sat down with rapper Lil Wayne on Apple Music’s Young Money Radio to discuss the new tracks, and his role as a father. The “God’s Plan” hitmaker has a two-year-old son, Adonis, who he posted pictures of for the very first time on his Instagram page on March 30. “I posted those pictures. It was great for me. It was great to just share that with the world and I just felt like … It wasn’t even anything I talked to anybody about or anything I planned,” he dished on episode two of Lil Wayne’s talkback show.
“I just woke up one morning and I was like, ‘you know what? This is just something that I want to do’,” Drake continued. “I want to be able to go places with my son and share memories with my son. I don’t want to feel like just because of a life choice I made to be a ‘celebrity’ that I got to make everybody live under this blanket. So, I just wanted to free myself of that. And I’ve watched you [Lil Wayne] be a functioning rap father for years, an incredible father.” Drake also admitted how much the “Lollipop” singer, and other rappers like 2 Chainz have inspired him to be a better father.
“A lot of the guys that we came up around [were] great family men on those tours and on those long studio nights when albums need to get done,” he said. “But specifically you, just how you always just made s**t function and work and how much love the people in your life have for you. And I could just tell the way your kids would stare at you that the time and effort that you put in as a father. So, that was really inspiring for me just to know that I can still keep pushing forward as a musician and be there for my son.”
Drake also talked about his new music, which he announced on Instagram on April 30. The mixtape not only includes a cheeky reference to Kylie Jenner’s billionaire net worth, but also boasts features from Chris Brown (“Not You Too“), Future (“Desires”), and Playboi Carti (“Pain 1993”). The overall mixtape was a joint effort between Drake and his “brothers,” Oliver El-Khatib (co-founder of Drake’s record label OVO) and producer Noel Cadastre. “My brothers put together a lot of the songs people have been asking for (some leaks and some joints from SoundCloud and some new vibes),” Drake explained.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kara Bosworth's dad Matt Keough dies weeks after tragic stillborn birth of her baby son</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reality star Kara Bosworth has been devastated by the death of her father mere weeks after the tragic stillborn birth of her baby son.
The Real Housewives of Orange County star, 32, has been rocked by the loss of dad Matt Keough, a former Oaklands Athletics pitcher and her special assistant, who died on Saturday at the age of 64.
Having lost her baby son in a stillborn birth a few weeks ago, Kara has now been left grieving over her beloved father.
Sharing a moving tribute to Matt on Instagram, Kara shared a sweet selection of throwback images of her father.
Caption the picture, Kara writes: "Daddy, please take care of my son.
"Teach him the circle changeup and how to find forever friends. You’re on grandpa duty in heaven now.
"Xoxo, Hammerhead."
Matt was married to Kara's mother and former Real Housewives of Orange County star Jeana Keough until their divorce last year, despite being separated for fifteen years.
The former couple had three children together, including Kara herself and her brothers Shane and Colton.
Jeana has herself posted a throwback tribute of her own on Instagram, with two handsome images of her late former husband.
Meanwhile, Oakland Athletics have now released their own statement on Matt's death.
Billy Beane, the team's executive vice president of baseball operations, commented: "Matt was a great baseball man and a proud Oakland A.
"He had an incredible passion for the game and we were lucky to have him and his wealth of knowledge alongside us for the years he worked as a special assistant.
"He left an unforgettable impression on everyone he touched in baseball.
"Our sincere condolences are with the entire Keough family tonight."
The post by Kara has seen an outpouring of support and grief in the replies.
Former RHOC star Tamra Judge comments: "Oh Kara. I am so sorry. Big hugs."
Fellow RHOC alumn Vicki Gunvalson also offers words of support to Kara.
Vicki writes: "Kara, I am so sorry. There are no words to say except that you are loved."
The tragedy comes after Kara's heartbreaking post last month that confirmed the loss of her and husband Kyle Bosworth's son McCoy Casey Bosworth on April 6.
She wrote at the time: "Weighing in at 11 pounds and 4 ounces and spanning 21 inches, McCoy surprised us all with his size and strength (and overall perfection).
"During the course of his birth, he experienced shoulder dystocia and a compressed umbilical cord.
"He joined our Heavenly Father and will live forever in the hearts of his loving parents, his adoring sister, and those that received his life-saving gifts."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Raveena Tandon Shares Her LAST Memory With Rishi Kapoor, Adds “My Dad Has Been Feeling Very Down”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Raveena Tandon was a child, Rishi Kapoor was already a big star. Years later, Raveena would star opposite the man who is one of the greatest romantic icons in Bollywood, heartthrob of millions.
Raveena shared her fond memories of Rishi Kapoor, who passed away on April 30, and also spoke of her father, filmmaker Ravi Tandon’s long association with the late actor.
“I have not worked with him in many movies but my dad has worked with him a lot. I have seen him since I was a child. I literally grew up in front of his eyes. My heart is heavy right now,” said Raveena, recalling Rishi Kapoor. She added: “Rishi sir’s death is a huge blow for my father. My father has lost one more friend from his inner circle. I clearly remember how my dad, Pancham uncle (RD Burman), Ramesh Behl uncle and Rishiji used to hang out together. After his demise, my dad has been feeling very down,” shared the beauty.
Ravi Tandon worked with Rishi Kapoor in films like “Khel Khel Mein” and “Jhoota Kahin Ka”. Raveena was paired opposite Rishi Kapoor in the 1995 movie “Saajan Ki Baahon Mein”.
Remembering her last encounter with Rishi Kapoor, who’s fondly called ‘Chintu’, Raveena shared that it happened last year when she met him during Ganpati pooja at Rishi Kapoor’s sister Rima Jain’s house in Mumbai.
“I was at Rima’s house for Ganpati pooja. When I was about to leave, Rima told me to wait as Chintu ji’s coming. I waited for him because I had not seen him for a long time since he was in New York. He came, we did aarti and had a good talk. That was my last and final memory of him. I will miss him a lot. May his soul rest in peace,” Raveena said.
She took to social media to mourn the death of Rishi Kapoor, remembering the first walkie talkie doll he bought for her as a gift from Paris.
“Just totally love you ! Seems like a part of my life, my childhood memories, my now..all taken away so fast. Not fair Chintu uncle. Not fair on all of us..could not even say a goodbye. We will miss you terribly. His infectious laughter, his wit, incidents, even when he used to scold me on sets when working with him. Still seeing me, as the same 5 year old he knew, my first walkie talkie doll he bought from Paris, a make-up gift for getting engaged to Neetu aunty without telling me,” Raveena recalled.
Rishi Kapoor died in a Mumbai hospital on April 30. He was 67 and had been battling leukemia.

    <h5 class="mb-1">An actor, mother, social worker – Nargis Dutt was far more than Mother India</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: Gap-toothed beauty Nargis Dutt, who graced the silver screen from the 1940s to ‘60s, has often been described as a legend. After all, there is a category in the National Film Awards named the ‘Nargis Dutt Award’ in her honour.
The first Indian actress to receive a Padma Shri award, Nargis featured in 51 films including Mother India, Barsaat, Shree 420 and Andaz. And yet her end was a lot more grim than her beginnings.
Nargis died of pancreatic cancer in 1981, just days before the release of Rocky, her son, Sanjay Dutt’s first movie. She was 51 years old and left behind a substantive body of work that proved she could play both a royal persona in an epic like Humayun and a spoiled cosmopolitan girl like in Andaz. But Nargis had range not just on screen, but off it as well.
At the peak of her fame, she gave up acting to raise a family and ended up dedicating her life to the cause of spastic children. Her charitable work earned her a seat in the Rajya Sabha in 1980. The Nargis Dutt Foundation, instituted in her honour, has been working in the field of health, education and women’s empowerment for the past 40 years.
On the star’s 39th death anniversary, ThePrint takes a look at her journey from actor to cultural icon.

Born Fatima Rashid on 1 June 1929, in Allahabad, she was someone in whose home “art was the way of life”. Her mother was a renowned classical singer, Jaddanbai, and her father belonged to an affluent family of Rawalpindi. The family briefly moved to Calcutta before settling down in Bombay. Young Nargis was what people then called a tomboy and loved playing badminton, but perhaps the first sign of her acting chops was in school plays at Queen Mary’s.
Nargis was steered into acting by her mother at a very young age. She made her debut at 4 in a film called Talashe Haq which her mother produced and curated music for. It’s no surprise that Nargis’ brother, Anwar Hussain also took up the craft.
But it was Mehboob Khan’s Mother India (1957) that put her on the map and it was Khan who suggested her stage name. In the film, she played Radha, a poor woman determined to raise her children despite hardships and social exploitation, who ends up killing her son, a bandit and sexual harasser (played by her future husband, Sunil Dutt). It won her a Filmfare Award for Best Actress in 1958 and became the first Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Awards.
Incidentally, it was on the set of this film that Sunil Dutt rescued her from a fire. Her on and off relationship with actor and filmmaker Raj Kapoor was the subject of some talk, and his son, the late Rishi Kapoor, even wrote about it in his memoir, Khullam Khulla.
In an interview with Simi Garewal, Sunil Dutt revealed that Nargis used to call him her “biggest Baby”. She extended the same care to many film crews she would work with. As one crew member recalls in her biographical documentary, Nargis would nag them about eating well and sleeping early.
The two raised three children – Sanjay, who became an actor, Priya, who joined the Congress party and Namrata, who has shied away from the limelight throughout her life. Sanjay, the eldest, was the “most pampered”. However, according to Yaseer Usman’s book Sanjay Dutt: The Crazy Untold Story of Bollywood’s Bad Boy, the middle child, Namrata remembers, “Mom sometimes got angry with Sanjay. She’d spew expletives like suwar, ullu, gadha and even threw a chappal at him.”
According to Priya, Nargis knew about Sanjay’s drug addiction during his youth “but didn’t want to accept it”. Her death left a lasting impact on him considering she passed three days before the launch of his first film, Rocky. At the premier, there was a chair left empty in her honour, recalled Sunil.
Nargis became the first patron of the Spastic Society of India in 1973 and in her biographical documentary, you can see her visit to the first clinic – playfully interacting with children and teaching them one-on-one. According to Mithu Alur, founder of the Spastic Society of India, Nargis told her she “always wanted to be a doctor and do medicine…but didn’t have the opportunity”. After her death, Sunil Dutt funded the Spastic Society. Little is known of what has become of the patronage since his death in 2005.
Priya has carried on the legacy of the Nargis Dutt Foundation, set up by Sunil in 1981, which has successfully set up medical camps across India and mobile clinics in slums. The actor’s battle with cancer also birthed the Nargis Dutt Memorial Cancer Foundation in 1982.
From the long list of honours and establishments set up in her memory, it’s safe to say Nargis has been immortalised. An actor, a mother, a social worker and a woman driven by compassion – the mark she left behind is yet to fade.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sister unveils tragic details about Madhubala's life</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Madhubala, who tragically passed away in 1969 at the age of 36, is still considered one of Bollywood’s earliest and finest beauties.
Her role as Anarkali set her apart from many of her contemporaries, and is still revered, decades after her death. But, Madhubala was not an enigma just because of the roles she played but also because of her tumultuous personal life.
As reported by Bollywood Hungama, one Yaser Khan on Twitter detailed her sister, Madhur Bhushan’s, remarks about her late, great sister. From her career beginnings to falling in multiple loves that were destined for failure and her sickness that ultimately took her life, Madhur, who lovingly referred to Madhubala as Apa, shared an intimate look at her.
“Apa first fell in love with Premnath. The relationship lasted six months. It broke on grounds of religion. He asked her to convert and she refused,” she revealed, adding that “the next relationship was with Dilip Kumar,” – a pairing that was immortalised in 1960’s Mughal-E-Azam. 
Madhur then talked about her long affair with Dilip Kumar, who she referred to as Bhaijan endearingly. “She met Bhaijan (Dilip Kumar) on the sets of Tarana. It was a nine year long affair. They even got engaged. Unki apa aayee thi, chunni lekar (his sister had come with a chunni as is the custom). Bhaijan was also a Pathan,” she said.
Madhur went on to clarify that their father never stopped them from getting married – many news outlets report that Madhubala’s father did not want to lose the financial security by getting her married. “We already had enough money by then and were financially secure,” said Madhur.
Talking endearingly about Dilip, Madhur also shared how he was respectful towards “us children” and addressed them with ‘ap’. The two would often go for a drive or sit in the room and talk.
What happened then to break one of India’s, perhaps, most iconic pairing? “The breakup with Dilip Kumar happened due to the court case during Naya Daur in the mid ’50s,” she said, detailing the issue further.
“The unit was to shoot somewhere in Gwalior. During the shooting of another film at the same location, a mob had attacked the women and even torn their clothes off. My father was wary and just asked that the locale be changed,” she reminisced.
“It’s not that he (their father) didn’t let her go outdoors. Apa had shot in Mahableshwar, Hyderabad and other places before. Bhaijan called my father ‘a dictator’ in court and sided with the Chopras (late BR Chopra was the director). Darare padh gayee, rishtey toot gaye (relationships were broken).”
Madhur also posed a question at the now 91 year-old Dilip Kumar – “We love and respect Bhaijan but I have just one question, ‘Aapki mohabbat yahan thi, aapki chahat yahan thi, phir aapne aisa kyun kiya (why didn’t you side with your love)?’ Bhaijan could’ve simply said let’s change the location. Or remained neutral.”
Madhur remembered how her Apa would cry a lot those days, and talk to Dilip on the phone in an effort to patch things up, and he was steadfast is his request, “Leave your father and I’ll marry you.” And she’d stick to hers, “I’ll marry you but just come home, say sorry and hug him.” It was zid (ego) which destroyed their love.
Their father, according to Madhur, never demanded her to break off her engagement with Dilip or demanded him to apologise.
For the majority of her life, Madhubala for the sole bread-winner for her family – from an age as early as perhaps 7-8 years old. Her father, a hot-headed Pathan could not bear being badly treated and lost a 15-year-old job in seconds, and they all relocated to Mumbai, where she got her first role as a child-actor in Basant. She remained the earning member till the last.
“Being Pathans we were all tall, fair and had long hair. But none of us sisters looked like her. Our mother was short. We had taken after our father. But we weren’t a patch on Apa. She loved wearing plain white sarees. At home she’d wear maxis. She loved mogras in her hair. She was fond of gold and kundan jewellery,” Madhur reminisced.
Madhubala later got married to Kishore Kumar and remained married to him till he death. “On the rebound Apa got involved with Kishore Kumar who was going through a divorce with Ruma Devi Guha Thakurta (actor-singer).”
“Their love affair went on for three years through Chalti Ka Naam Gadi and Half Ticket. They got married in 1960, when she was 27. After marriage, a doctor told her she had only two years. After that Kishore left her at our house saying, ‘I can’t look after her. I’m on outdoors often’,” shared Madhur of her sister’s unfulfilled marriage.
“She wanted to be with him. He’d visit her once in two months though. He never abused her as was reported. He bore her medical expenses. They remained married for nine years.”
Madhur shared how, during her last nine years, she was confined to bed and was reduced to just bones and skin. “She’d keep crying, ‘Mujhe zinda rehna hai, mujhe marna nahin hai, doctor kab ilaaj nikalenge (I want to live, I don’t want to die, wonder when the doctors will find a cure).”
During her last days, Madhur, who was 19 by that time was suffering from chicken pox and couldn’t visit her Apa who passed away on February 23, 1969 at the age of 36. “Though Bhaijan never visited her when she was unwell, he flew down from Madras to pay his last respects at the kabrastan (cemetery). Food was sent from his home to ours for three days (as is the custom).”
In the end, Madhur shared that her sister was heart-broken, although content, when Dilip Kumar married Saira Banu. “She’d say, ‘Unke naseeb mein woh (Saira Banu) thi, main nahin’. But she’d also say, ‘He’s got married to a very pretty girl. She’s so devoted. I’m very happy for him’. But a vacuum remained in her heart.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Family, friends throw surprise drive-by parade for quarantined Hickory assisted living worker</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HICKORY, N.C. (WBTV) - A family dedicated to the service of others continues to hang strong tonight in light of COVID-19.
Four years ago, WBTV shared the story of Bradley Long, who was a Sherrills Ford firefighter. On June 6, 2016, Long died while searching for a missing man on Lake Norman.
When Bradley went underwater, he never resurfaced. He was 28 years old when he died.
Long’s sister Amy spoke exclusively with WBTV News after his death. Nearly four years later, Amy has been away from her kids and family for 19 days. She's been working at an assisted living home during this pandemic.
Amy is now enduring another struggle after she tested positive for COVID-19 last week.
She’s in a Hickory hotel, quarantined for 14-days. Amy’s older brother Chad, who is a Lincoln County Deputy, organized a drive-by parade in support of his sister. Cars and firetrucks lined up outside the hotel.
Family and loved ones stood outside with loving messages. WBTV was at the hotel as Amy was looking out the window, clearly emotional. Even from a distance, her family wanted her to know they're with her.
“I get on her all the time of how much she volunteers at school and running the concession stand and doing things at school and that’s all she wants to do is give, give, give, so I was so thankful to have these people come out and give back to her,” her father Jerry Long said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Asha Bhosle says Rishi Kapoor’s death was like losing her fourth child</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rishi Kapoor succumbed to leukemia on April 30, 2020. While everyone has said highly about the actor and how he was the livewire of any party or social gathering, Asha Bhosle too poured her heart out about the loss of Bollywood’s true gem.
Asha Bhosle spoke to a leading daily recently and in her interview she got emotional about Rishi Kapoor’s death. She said that losing him was like losing her fourth child, as the singer was close to the actor who has entertained for generations. She said, “I broke down when I heard the news of his death. Mujhe aisa laga ki mere teen bachche hain, unme chautha bachcha ye tha jo chala gaya. I haven’t spoken to any of his family members yet, as I don’t feel that it would be right to call them at this time. Par unko pata hain ki mera pyaar bahut tha uss par.” The singer spoke praises about him and said that in our industry there’s nobody like Rishi Kapoor, as he was the true artiste. Excerpts from the interview, “Industry mein bahut bade artistes hain, lekin Rishi jaisa koi artiste nahin hai. He could dance well, was a great romantic hero and played tragic parts very well, too.”As we all know that Rishi Kapoor was a big foodie and used to love various cuisines. Asha Bhosle used to cook for him at times. But she says that now she’s lost him, she will not cook his favourite dish and neither even eat it, “I don’t think I will ever be able to cook his favourite dishes. Usko jo pasand tha, main banaungi bhi nahin aur khaungi bhi nahin.” Clearly, the loss is immense for everyone – his friends and for movie-lovers.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mithila Palkar, who starred alongside the late Irrfan Khan in the film Karwaan, sang and dedicated a special song for him. Mithila pays a beautiful tribute to Irrfan, who passed away on April 29, 2020, after succumbing to a colon infection.
Sharing the video, Mithila wrote, "Hey Shaukat, This #SingSongSaturday is dedicated to you. I'm struggling with the singing and strumming as usual but I tried to learn this just so I could bother you with my Binaca Geetmala, one last time. Khush rehna, jahaan bhi ho. Khuda haafiz Love. Tanya. #KarwaanForever," (sic).
Mithila had earlier shared a still from the film, where she plays a young girl who shares a cab with others on a long journey, with Irrfan being the cab driver. Sharing the picture where she and Irrfan are seen smiling joyfully, she wrote, "Happy times, happier memories! Rest in peace, Sir. They don't make gems like you anymore." Karwaan was a 2018 movie directed by Akarsh Khurana and produced by Ronnie Screwvala and Prithi Rathi Gupta.
Irrfan had been diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumor back in 2018 and underwent treatment for it in the UK. He was last seen in the film Angrezi Medium, starring alongside Pankaj Tripathi, Deepak Dobriyal, Radhika Madana, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Dimple Kapadia. The film was a spin off to the 2017 film Hindi Medium, and was directed by Homi Adajania. After seeing a limited release in theatres due to the Coronavirus lockdown, the film released on an OTT platform.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">January Jones, 42, is looking better than ever while in quarantine and her latest photo proves it! The actress shared an eye-catching photo of herself smiling and posing in a green bikini while going for a morning swim and in it, she looked fantastic. She also wore sunglasses and jewelry, including hoop earrings and a necklace in the snapshot and used the caption for the photo to give a shout-out to her mom for her birthday. “Morning lap swim! Happy Birthday Mom! 💙” the caption read. The blonde beauty also shared a few pics from her lap to her Instagram story and left a caption that advised her followers by writing “don’t forget your flotation devices.”
It didn’t take long for fans to leave positive comments on January’s pic once she posted it. “Truly a beautiful woman 💙💚” one follower wrote while another agreed by writing “beautiful picture of you.” Others simply said, “Wow” and exclaimed that she is “so pretty!”
This isn’t the first time January stunned in something green. Who could forget her amazing green jumpsuit at the 2015 Emmy Awards? The epic fashion choice was strapless and helped her show off her slim figure on the red carpet. She also looks great in other colors too like red, which she showed off when she wore a red dress in some pics she posted to Instagram in Dec. 2019. The dress included a plunging neckline with a lacy lining, a fitted waist and a draping skirt bottom.
Since we’re used to being impressed by January’s awesome fashion sense and fitting figure, her latest photos are no surprise and we hope to see more soon. It’s great to know she’s staying healthy and active in quarantine!

    <h5 class="mb-1">January Jones Risks Wardrobe Malfunction in New Quarantine Bikini Photos</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">January Jones is heating things up while at home for quarantine! The Mad Men and Last Man on Earth actress shared a series of selfies on Saturday that show herself wearing a tiny teal bikini while swimming. She revealed one in her main feed, while sharing two others in her Instagram Story. The photos served two purposes: they both wished her mom a happy birthday, and showed off her swimsuit look.
In her Story, she first shared a photo of her mom in a one-piece bikini with the caption, "Happy birthday hot mama!" before repeating a similar sentiment in her main photo's caption. She then shared two more pictures, adding the captions "Laps?" and "Don't forget your Flotation devices," swiping a cheeky comment her Spinning Out co-star Will Kemp left on her own photo. Elsewhere in the main photo's comments, the star, who also appeared in X-Men: First Class and The Politician, caught flak for wearing jewelry in the photos. Jones pointed out that "gold doesn’t rust" and she was doing "water aerobics," regardless.
The flirty photos earned a lot of praise in the comments, especially from Jones' famous peers. Mad Men co-star Kiernan Shipka wrote "[Oh my f—ing god]," and Real Housewives of Beverly Hills personality Lisa Rinna wrote "BODY." Resident Evil and Dazed and Confused actress Milla Jovovich also added, "Happy Birthday beautiful!!"
The bikini shots showed off Jones' figure, which she has been working on keeping in optimal shape. In February, the 42-year-old star opened up to Shape about her past ideas of fitness, which were lax to say the least.
“My dad was a trainer, so in my 20s and 30s, I didn’t work out, because he was always pushing my sisters, my mom, and me to exercise. We would rebel and not do it,” she she said. “It’s not that I wasn’t active. As kids, my two sisters were runners, I played tennis, and we all swam. But on a regular basis I wouldn’t work out, ever. Even when I was filming X-Men and they had trainers for all of us, I would lie and say I was exercising in my hotel room, when actually I was watching Friends and having full tea service."
However, her attitude soon changed, as she later added, "After I had my son, Xander, I wanted to feel strong because my body had changed so much. As he got bigger and I was hauling around a 20- or 30-pound toddler, my lower back gave out and I saw my shoulders starting to curl and hunch. I wanted to do something for my posture and core strength. Two or three years ago I started doing barre classes, and after that I took regular private Pilates lessons. Then a friend told me about Lagree Pilates. I’ve been doing it two to four times a week for the past year now, and I’ve gained weight because I’ve put on muscle. I’ve gone up a size in clothes, but I feel like I look better naked."

    <h5 class="mb-1">January Jones Stuns In A Teal Bikini: ‘Happy Birthday Mom!’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Treva Bowdoin
January revealed that she was going for a morning swim.
January Jones kicked off the weekend by flaunting her fit figure in a chic bikini. However, when she shared a photo of her stylish swimwear with her 985,000 Instagram followers, the caption she included with it had a few of her followers scratching their heads.
The 42-year-old Mad Men star wished her mother, Karen, a happy birthday. She also wrote that she was participating in a “morning lap swim” when her photo was taken. The latter revelation led to one of January’s followers making an observation about the array of accessories she was wearing with her two-piece. The actress was rocking a gold medallion necklace with a thick chain, a pair of large textured gold hoop earrings, and retro cat-eye sunglasses with metallic frames and dark lenses.
“Lap swim with necklace, earrings and sunglasses?” the seemingly skeptical commenter wrote.
“Gold doesn’t rust. and it was more a water aerobics situation,” January explained.
The teal swimsuit that January chose for her workout featured a halter neck design with adjustable sliding cups. A small panel of aqua fabric looped around the top of the bikini’s thick halter strap. The string underneath the bust was also the light cyan shade, and the entire bathing suit was trimmed with the color.
January was wearing the cups of her bikini top scrunched inwards to expose a generous amount of her ample cleavage, including more than a hint of sideboob spillage. She was standing in chest-deep water, but, because it was crystal-clear, the bottom half of her bathing suit was still visible. January was wearing a pair of high-waisted briefs that hit her right below the bellybutton. The bottoms had wide sides with low-cut leg openings that showed off her athletic thighs and a hint of her pert posterior. Her two-piece also showcased her trim waist and flat stomach.
The actress was wearing her chin-length blond hair loosely pulled back. Her pale skin was flawless, and her lips were a soft, natural shade of pink. She was flashing a big smile at the camera as she held her arms out to the sides.
Over the span of an hour, January’s morning workout photo racked up over 47,000 likes. Her followers also flocked to the comments section to share their thoughts about the snapshot.
“I’m relieved to see you using flotation devices…” read a popular response from actor Will Kemp.
“Hold up, my jaw fell, have to go back an pick it up,” another commenter wrote.
“Wow!!!!!!! You just made me take a deep breath. Flawless,” a third Instagrammer remarked.
The X-Men: First Class star isn’t the only stunning blond celebrity who has left her fans awestruck by flaunting her bikini body on Instagram. As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Jessica Simpson treated her followers to a sizzling swimsuit snap that also received rave reviews.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan Khan left a gaping hole in not just Bollywood, but in world cinema too. While fans were shattered when news broke out of the Maqbool actor passing away, it was his family who suffered the most. While the late actor’s wife Sutapa Sikder wrote an emotional letter on the actor’s demise, his son Babil too shared his heartfelt condolences.
While Babil had earlier shared a moving video that saw Irrfan Khan gorging on Pani Puri at a fancy restaurant, he has given fans yet another treat to the Maqbool actor’s NSD days.
Taking to his social media handle, Babil has shared some black and white photos from Irrfan Khan’s National School of Drama (NSD) days. Take a look at the post here:
The NSD had released an official statement on Irrfan Khan’s demise that read, “Not only the National School of Drama has lost one of its meritorious members, Irrfan’s demise is a big loss to the Indian art and cinema fraternity.”
Irrfan Khan had a long and painful battle against cancer to which he eventually succumbed on 29th April at the Kokilaben Ambani hospital, where he was admitted for a colon infection.
Babil has thanked all the fans and admirers of Irrfan Khan for the love and respect that they have showered on the deceased actor. Babil’s statement read, “I’m deeply grateful for all the condolences you beautiful friends are pouring in for me. Although I hope you understand that right now I’m not being able to reply because my vocabolary is dizzy. I will get back to each one of you but just not right now. Thank you so much. I love you.”
Our heart reaches out to Irrfan Khan’s family and may God bless them with strength and courage to deal with these difficult days.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yolanda Hadid is so excited about becoming a grandmother! The former Real Housewives star, whose supermodel daughter Gigi Hadid is expecting her first child with Zayn Malik, remained super tight-lipped about the pregnancy. “Yolanda was very quiet about Gigi and Zayn’s announcement until they said something,” a source close to the family told HollywoodLife. “She ignored several calls and texts about the topic even to her closest friends. Everyone was reaching out to her, and she’d reply very short replies if anything, but she didn’t address the topic.”
The source described the mom-of-three as a “mama bear” and revealed she already thinks of Zayn as one of her own. “Yolanda is a great person and friend and can be trusted and she’s a mama bear who protects her children always,” they dished. “She considers Zayn as one of her own. If they work for her kids, they work for her. The family didn’t think it would get out there since so few people knew, but they’re all very, very excited and happy.”
After a few days of speculation over whether or not there was a bun in her oven, Gigi confirmed the news while speaking with Jimmy Fallon. “Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms, but we’re very excited and happy and grateful for everyone’s well wishes and support,” she said during the Apr. 30 edition of The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon. She also confirmed that Zayn in the father, after some thought that Tyler Cameron might have been the one who got her pregnant.
Gigi, who was isolating with her family on their Pennsylvania farm, said that this current pandemic has provided “a silver lining,” since it was nice for her to “be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day.” During the chat, she also dished on her biggest pregnancy craving. She said that she eats an “everything bagel” every day, and she was excited that her 25th birthday cake was actually a giant everything bagel. “Then I found out that Buddy [Valastro], the ‘Cake Boss,’ made my cake … I don’t know if it was my hormones right now or just, like, quarantine emotional-ness, but I cried every five minutes for an hour every time I thought about that Buddy made my cake.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gigi Hadid And Zayn Malik are expecting a baby together and the whole world is excited, including, or rather, especially, family members and others close to them! That being said, singer Dua Lipa, who is dating Gigi’s brother Anwar, opened up about the great news.
After calling in to The Edge NZ, the star admitted that ‘Yeah! It’s very exciting news.’
Dua and Anwar have been in isolation together so she was definitely amongst the first few people who found out about the pregnancy, right?
Maybe not because she was asked about it and she claimed that she learned about it ‘a little bit’ but not ‘too long‘ before the happy news became public knowledge.
The hosts made sure to congratulate her for pretty much becoming an ‘auntie!’
This comes after Gigi confirmed she is indeed pregnant following days of rumors.
During a chat with Jimmy Fallon, she dished that ‘Obviously, we wished we could’ve announced it on our terms, but we are very excited, happy and grateful for everybody’s well wishes and support.’
And that was not all as the supermodel also made sure to mention that Zayn Malik was the baby daddy since there were speculations floating around that it was, in fact, Tyler Cameron!
Gigi has been spending her quarantine with her loved ones on their farm in Pennsylvania and it sounds like she doesn’t mind being stuck at home because of that.
After all, she explained that there was a true ‘silver lining‘ and that is being ‘able to be home, be together and truly experience it day by day.’
The mom to be also revealed her biggest pregnancy cravings, saying that it’s ‘everything bagel’ and that she eats it every day!
That being said, she mentioned how happy she was that her birthday cake was a huge everything bagel.
‘Then I found out that Buddy [Valastro], the ‘Cake Boss,’ made my cake … I do not know if it was my hormones or just, like, quarantine emotionalness, but I cried every 5 minutes for an hour every time I thought about Buddy made my cake,’ she told the host.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chupke Se Anup Jalota ke saath shaadi? Hear it from the horse's mouth. Jasleen is ready to talk about the chain of events, rather candidly
On Tuesday, Jasleen Matharu (of Bigg Boss 12) posted a picture, where the actress was dressed in a floral night suit and seen wearing a chooda, with sindoor on her forehead. This made many wonder if she has tied the nuptial knot. 
However, talking to us later in the day, Ms Matharu clarified that she hasn't got married but this is her look for a project. Interestingly, in another of her earlier interviews with us, Jasleen had revealed, "I am in the mood of getting married but it's just that I haven't found the right person yet. Mere dil ki ghanti nahi baji ab tak."
And now, as per Jasleen some people are still not believing her that she hasn't exchanged marriage vows. Speaking to us exclusively about it, she said, "Ever since I posted that picture, people are sending me congratulatory messages. Many friends are even wishing me 'A Happy Married Life'. In fact, that very day, Kashmera Shah texted me on similar lines."
And what did she tell Ms Shah? "Well, I told her the truth, what else? I was touched with her gesture, though."
Jasleen signs off by saying that some of her fans are still in the 'No Belief' zone and telling her that 'they're heartbroken'. On the other hand, some of them have asked her: 'Who is the man?  Anup Jalota se toh shaadi nahin karli?'
Talking about how it all started, Ms Matharu explained, "I was shooting a music video on the song Chupke Se from Saathiya at home. Yes, I dressed like a newly-wed girl at her honeymoon. But surely, I didn't expect that it would lead to so much chaos."Image Source:- instagram/jasleenmatharu/ jalotaanup/ sunil.r.khandare

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Halle Berry, 53, used some of her time in quarantine to use a hair product she loves and showed off a stunning photo of herself to promote it. The actress shared a snapshot that showed her standing in front of a shower with wet curly locks and no makeup while taking a selfie with her phone and her all natural look is definitely a beautiful sight to see. “Settling in on this fine #SelfCareSaturday with a much needed #HairMask, courtesy of my girl @tarajiphenson’s new line of hair care products, @tphbytaraji . I’ve known this woman since she started in the industry, and it’s been such a joy to watch her flourish and succeed. Obsessed with this line, check my stories for a few of my favorites! ♥️” Halle captioned the pic. 
Once Halle’s pic went public, her followers couldn’t help but gush over her incredible beauty and even complimented her on her support of other women. “Gorgeous. Women supporting women! 👏” one follower wrote while another wrote, “No matter what you do you look good.” Others left hearts and heart-eyed emojis to show their support.
Before her latest quarantine pic, Halle shared many other pics of herself during her time at home and throwback pics as well, including one on May 1. It showed her posing in a sheer black lingerie-style outfit that showed off her incredible figure as she put her hands up on her head. “Ahhhhh the simpler times,” she captioned the pic, most likely referring to the times when quarantine due to the coronavirus wasn’t in effect.
It’s always awesome to see pics of Halle in and out of quarantine. We’re happy she’s staying healthy and positive and hope to see more moments soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">All the times Katrina Kaif made a statement with florals</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Katrina Kaif is an actor who’s par excellence. She is well known for her strides in fashion, too. Keeping it simple and chic, it does not come as a surprise that the actor loves her florals. If you are someone who is a fan of the print, too, this is the best time to bookmark her look ranging from lehengas to saris and dresses. Take a look at all the times she turned heads wearing these prints.
In a gorgeous lehenga from the house of Sabyasachi; the white lehenga features floral prints in pink with a majestic drape. It is perfect for a summer wedding. The lehenga was paired with statement golden chaandbaalis and sleek straight hair.
Katrina Kaif looks like a dream in this floral midi dress featuring small floral prints paired with a cropped beige coat. If you are someone who wants to keep it simple, opt for small floral prints. Pro tip: if you want to make people wonder how you lost all of that weight, go for small prints.
Styled by celebrity stylist Ami Patel, the floral sari, a Sabyasachi creation, features black sequined borders. Styled with a black sleeveless blouse and a pair of silver studs, the look was put together with Kaif’s basic makeup.
Hands down, this is our favourite outfit. This one’s too is from Sabyasachi — a stunning baby pink sari featuring flowers in dark pink, it was styled with a full-sleeves blouse. The look was pulled together with a waistband with the same floral print and the Sabyasachi logo. For the accessories, she kept it simple with a pair of dainty earrings.
Making it to the list of perfect brunch outfits, this body con floral dress wins our heart. Keeping it minimal just like the actor always does, she paired it with a pair of silver hoops. The bodycon dress, which features ruffles, was completed with soft brown smokey eyes.
What do you think about her looks?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Sarah Batool Haider
Peruvian model Paula Manzanal recently took to her Instagram page and treated her 2 million followers to a hot bikini snapshot.
In the pic, which was uploaded to the photo-sharing platform on Saturday, May 2, Paula could be seen rocking a skimpy, purple velvet bikini that perfectly accentuated her curves. That’s not all, but the risque ensemble also allowed her to show off a glimpse of her underboob while drawing viewers’ attention to her taut stomach and sexy legs.
She sported a full face of makeup in keeping with her signature style. The makeup application featured a beige foundation that perfectly matched her sunkissed skin. She dusted her cheeks with a coral blush, opted for a mauve shade of lipstick, light purple eyeshadow, lined eyes, and a thick coat of mascara. She finished off her makeup application with defined eyebrows.
Paula wore her blond tresses in a ponytail to pull off a very sporty look. She accessorized with a white-and-purple cap and allowed a few strands of her hair to fall over her cheeks. To ramp up the glam, she had her perfectly-manicured nails painted with a peach-colored polish. As for jewelry, she kept it very simple by only opting for a dainty gold bracelet.
Paula wrote a caption in Spanish, and according to a Google translation, she informed her fans that she has uploaded a new video on her YouTube channel where she has talked about how she lost 10 kilograms of weight after her pregnancy. She also urged her fans to subscribe to her channel.
Within eight hours of posting, the snap garnered more than 43,000 likes. Her most ardent admirers also flocked to the comments section and posted 500-plus messages to praise Paula’s sexy body and let her know how much they adore her.
“One of the most beautiful faces in the entertainment industry. Can’t get enough of you, Paula,” one of her fans commented on the snap.
“Omg, you look so hot and sexy in this bikini. I really want your body!” another user chimed in.
“Damn Paula, you look so gorgeous, I have no words to describe your beauty,” a third follower wrote.
“This is one of your best photos on IG. Thanks for your wonderful uploads,” a fourth admirer expressed his gratitude.
Many of her fellow models and influencers also liked and commented on the snap to show appreciation and support, including Katrin Freud, Laurence Bedard, Nina Serebrova, Vicky Aisha, and Brooke Lynette.
Paula regularly treats her fans to her hot pics. Not too long ago, she shared a very sexy snap in which she was featured rocking a white crocheted top and matching bottoms.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'It's just scary': Kylie Jenner says the coronavirus hits 'close to home' in the latest KUWTK trailer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“Keeping Up with the Kardashians” won’t be back until September, but a recently released trailer revealed some of the topics the show will be taking on next season, including the coronavirus pandemic.
The trailer, which gives a sneak peek of the show’s 19th season, broaches the topic with a voiceover of Kim who says, “The White House said that the coronavirus is serious,” over ominous music. The trailer also mentions the Los Angeles stay-at-home order, which went into effect on March 19.
It also includes a clip of Kylie Jenner telling the camera that the coronavirus pandemic hits “close to home,” though the clip doesn’t offer any more details into what the Kylie Cosmetics founder meant.
“It’s just scary when someone so close to home has tested positive,” she said.
In recent weeks, many celebrities tested positive for COVID-19, including Tom Hanks, Pink, and Idris Elba.
It appears season 19 will touch on the ways the Kardashian family has been affected by the pandemic. One clip shows Scott Disick saying he’s going a bit stir crazy, and another shows a tearful Kris Jenner telling Khloe over the phone she wishes she could hug her.
The trailer also features non-coronavirus-related clips, including Kris and Disick pulling a prank and the family speculating about whether Khloe has hooked up with ex Tristan Thompson.
“Keeping Up with the Kardashians” will return to E! in September. You can watch the trailer for season 19 here:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Radio presenter Sarah-Jane Crawford announces baby news</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TV and radio presenter Sarah-Jane Crawford is expecting her first child, with football manager Brian Barry-Murphy.
The host of the Sunday Chart Show on Hits Radio discovered she was pregnant before Christmas, and is due to give birth in early August.
After a difficult first trimester, Crawford said she was feeling “more energised” as she prepared to enter the final stage.
She told Hello! magazine: “We are both over the moon. We found out just before Christmas. It was an incredible present.
“I’ve noticed my body is changing with the seasons. When summer comes it will be the blossoming of everything. It’s an amazing journey.”
Rochdale manager Barry-Murphy, 41, has an eight-year-old daughter from a previous relationship.
Crawford said: “Blending a family is a special thing. I’ve come from a blended family too.
“Brian is very excited to be a dad all over again. He loves being a dad and he knew (being a parent) is something I really wanted, too. It’s a new chapter in our relationship.”
Crawford, who has West African and Irish heritage, said that, having dealt with insecurities, she would be passing on a positive message to her child.
She said: “I had things I hated about myself, like my lips, when I was growing up, but now I’m really proud of my looks.
“I’ll pass on the message to my child that: ‘You’re beautiful.’
“I want them to know that their uniqueness is what makes them special. I want them to feel proud of themselves and of their own natural beauty.
“When it comes to learning to love yourself, I have lots of good life experience to pass on.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Radio presenter Sarah-Jane Crawford announces baby news</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TV and radio presenter Sarah-Jane Crawford is expecting her first child, with football manager Brian Barry-Murphy.
The host of the Sunday Chart Show on Hits Radio discovered she was pregnant before Christmas, and is due to give birth in early August.
After a difficult first trimester, Crawford said she was feeling “more energised” as she prepared to enter the final stage.
She told Hello! magazine: “We are both over the moon. We found out just before Christmas. It was an incredible present.
“I’ve noticed my body is changing with the seasons. When summer comes it will be the blossoming of everything. It’s an amazing journey.”
Rochdale manager Barry-Murphy, 41, has an eight-year-old daughter from a previous relationship.
Crawford said: “Blending a family is a special thing. I’ve come from a blended family too.
“Brian is very excited to be a dad all over again. He loves being a dad and he knew (being a parent) is something I really wanted, too. It’s a new chapter in our relationship.”
Crawford, who has West African and Irish heritage, said that, having dealt with insecurities, she would be passing on a positive message to her child.
She said: “I had things I hated about myself, like my lips, when I was growing up, but now I’m really proud of my looks.
“I’ll pass on the message to my child that: ‘You’re beautiful.’
“I want them to know that their uniqueness is what makes them special. I want them to feel proud of themselves and of their own natural beauty.
“When it comes to learning to love yourself, I have lots of good life experience to pass on.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">50 Cent Reveals Painting of Himself as Mike Pence</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson had a very interesting surprise in store for his fans on Instagram recently. On Sunday, he posted a photo of a painting of himself portrayed as Mike Pence — yes, really. In addition to posting the snaps, he included some very choice words for the artist behind the image. As you might have guessed, the wild 50 Cent/Pence mural is truly something to behold.
The mural appears to showcase Pence, but his face is morphed by Jackson's. On Instagram, 50 Cent wrote alongside the snap, "This f—ing guy won’t stop, [shake my head] I guess i’m not wearing a mask because i’m tested frequently." He added, in a separate Instagram post, "wait how does this even happen, what is this guys problem with me. f—ing lunatic i need a drink." According to Billboard, murals, crafted by Melbourne-based graffiti artist Lushsux, featuring 50 Cent's likeness have appeared all over Australia. Not only has the rapper appeared as Pence, but portraits have also popped up featuring him as Taylor Swift, Donald Trump, and Post Malone, which is why he mentioned that the artist "won't stop" with the wild murals.
It's particularly interesting to see Jackson's likeness morphed with Pence's because of the rapper's thoughts regarding the Trump administration. In August of 2019, 50 Cent told the Daily Beast that he was offered a large sum of money to appear at Trump's January 2017 inauguration. But, he refused the offer for a very specific reason.
“He offered me a half-million just to come!” 50 Cent said. “I didn’t think that was a good move at that point. You find out that every dollar is not a good dollar, and how do you repair the damage that that does?” Elsewhere in his conversation with the publication, the conversation turned towards rapper A$AP Rocky, who received support from the president after he was placed in jail in Sweden following an alleged assault incident.
“He’s still the president of America at the present moment. You’re gonna help A$AP? Wait… this kid is from Harlem!” the rapper said, with a laugh. “This is more exciting than an Emmy or a Golden Globe. I would take the tweet, print it out, and have the little picture from Twitter go next to it and put it on the wall, because he’s talking specifically about me while he’s the president of America. We’re just living in a different climate right now. It’s crazy.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Recently, an Australian artist has been painting murals of 50 Cent’s face placed on to various figures in music and politics. However, they haven’t been flattering figures, which has caused 50 Cent to re-post the murals along with his commentary. Artist Lushux previously put 50’s face on Taylor Swift and Donald Trump, and now the artist put the Queens rapper’s face on Vice President Mike Pence. In true 50 fashion, he gave his thoughts on the artist as well as Mike Pence.
On the caption of his Instagram post, 50 said: “👀This f**king guy won’t stop, SMH 🤦‍♂️I guess I’m not wearing a mask because i’m tested frequently. 😤.” 50’s comment is calling out Pence who reportedly didn’t wear a mask while visiting the Mayo Clinic, even though the clinic states that all visitors are required to wear a mask while in the building. Take a look above.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan's deaths have shocked us all. Senior writer Niranjan Iyengar rues the fact that he couldn't see them before their final journey.
Sorry, but I have called you to talk about Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan. You wrote many of their movies...Yes, I had the privilege of writing Irrfan Khan's first film as a hero- Rog. I also wrote Student Of The Year, which had Rishi Kapoor. And then of course, D-Day, which had both.Were you involved in the decision making of casting them in any of those?
It was pre-decided that Rishi would play Dawood Ibrahim in D-Day. And no, I wasn't involved in any decision of casting them.
Were you there on the sets of these films?
Yes.
Please continue...
So many memories, I used to live very close to KrishnaRaj and meet up with Rishiji so often over drinks. Frankly, I don't know where to start from.
The last time you spoke to him?
It was on a call about 2 months ago. He told me 'Aa ja, our drinks are pending'. I don't know why I kept procrastinating 'Aata hoon kal, Aata hoon phir kabhi'. And now, toh... (trails off).
Your memories with both, Rishi and Irrfan, together..
That was obviously during the making of D-Day. We were shooting close to Ahmedabad. Rishi used to chat with me a lot- stories during the making of Jhoota Kahin Ka, Khel Khel Mein and many other films which he had done in the past.
He used to ask me why I don't drink. He loved drinks. And let me also tell you that he was a big foodie, so much so that he would even go to the kitchen and see kya ban raha hai, kaise ban raha hai.
Both, Rishi and Irrfan, were very strong actors. Any kind of disagreements between them?
No. They had their discussions, of course. But there was no friction at all. Haan yeh zaroor tha that Rishi would get impatient when he had too many lines to say. Lekin phir main unko mana leta tha.
And of course, I shall never forget that scene which they shot together. The set-up had a mosque and even I was a part of it; I was very reluctant to do that scene but Nikkhil (Advani, director) and Rishi coaxed me to do it.
Parting shot?
I am feeling so sad. I couldn't go to pay my last respects to them because of the lockdown. I wish I had got the chance to see them for one last time.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The demise of Rishi Kapoor is a huge loss to the Hindi film industry. This loss is being felt not just by fans and audiences, who got to watch him on screen, but also Rishi Kapoor's friends and colleagues in the industry, who valued his incredible presence.
In a recent interview, filmmaker Mukesh Bhatt said that there cannot be another copy of Rishi, and he was grateful to have met him in his life.
Speaking to SpotboyE, Mukesh said, "He was a man who like Bhatt saab (Mahesh Bhatt) and I, never minced words. He said things not to down people. He said things what he felt. But what's wrong with that? I have so many memories about him. And so many times, good memories tend to give you pain."
He also spoke about how Rishi encouraged people to live in the moment. "He always used to say, 'Arre yaar, leave it. Even this shall pass away. Maze le. Let's enjoy the moment'. I hope that we all start thinking like him. You can't make a xerox copy of Chintu. I am happy and lucky that I met him in my life. You know what? People whom you genuinely love never die for you. Rishi will live in my heart forever," he added.
Rishi Kapoor breathed his last on April 30, 2020 at 8:45 am. The veteran actor had been battling leukemia for two years and received treatment for it in New York City.
Rishi left in the presence of his wife Neetu Kapoor and son Ranbir Kapoor. His daughter Riddhima Kapoor was in New Delhi and therefore could not make it in time for his funeral. However, she shared that she is driving down from Delhi to Mumbai to mourn with her family.

    <h5 class="mb-1">When Irrfan Khan left everyone including Navjot Sidhu in splits by ‘threatening’ to strangulate Kapil Sharma on The Kapil Sharma Show for comedian’s controversial tweet against BMC</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bollywood legend Irrfan Khan passed away last week after battling cancer for two years at the age of 53. His tragic death left Bollywood stunned as his millions of fans paid him rich tribute for his extraordinary contribution to the entertainment industry. Kapil Sharma was one of the very few stars, who attended the veteran actor’s last rites. Not many would know that Irrfan had once teased The Kapil Sharma Show host by threatening to strangulate him for causing trouble in his life by his controversial tweet.
When asked about hsi family’s well-being, Irrfan had said, “Yaar, my family is fine but if you talk about my house, I will strangulate you.” This left everyone including Navjot Singh Sidhu in splits. Then addressing Sidhu, Irrfan said, “Paji, I bought a house. Then I learnt that Kapil stays in the same building. I was very happy that being an elder brother Kapil will visit me from time to time. I didn’t know that he is so powerful that he will ruin my life by a single tweet. And our media is also so ‘responsible’ that they are making me suffer for the crime committed by him (Kapil). It is as if only Kapil and I stay in that building, no one  else lives there.”
Irrfan asked Kapil why he was invisible since he had not seen him once even though both lived in the same building. Kapil replied that he was embroiled into legal wrangles even before he could enter his house. Irrfan had jokingly asked him if he ever felt bad for causing trouble to him by his controversial tweet.
Irrfan once again raked up the issue of Kapil’s tweet during the conversation when the comedian told him that children these days did not get a beating as was the case when he was growing up. To which Irrfan once again teased Kapil as he said, “I almost got (thrashed) because of your tweet.” This once again left the audience in splits.
Irrfan continued, “I had never realised your real power. I was aware of your talent as a comedian and the strength of my friendship with you. But never realised that you can wreak havoc in my life with just one tweet.”
The comedian in September 2016 had kicked up a controversy by alleging in a tweet that he had been asked to pay a bribe of Rs 5 lakh by an official from the BMC for the construction of his premises in Versova, suburban Andheri. He had also tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his tweet.
“I am paying Rs 15 cr income tax from last 5 year n still i have to pay Rs 5 lakhs bribe to BMC office for making my office @narendramodi (sic),” Kapil had said in his tweet.
Later, he was accused of destroying mangroves in the area with an illegal structure. The BMC had sent notices to many other residents including Irrfan.
Irrfan was diagnosed with NeuroEndocrine cancer in 2018. He had travelled to London for the treatment and returned home last year. After his return to Mumbai, the popular actor had penned an emotional note to his fans, stating that he wanted to ‘pause to be grateful’ for the ‘immense love and support’ that he received from them.
Kapil was one of the very few celebrities from Bollywood who braved the COVID-19 lockdown to attend his funeral in Mumbai. He had also written an emotional note on Irrfan’s death.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: An online shopper in Dubai was left stunned when she ordered fake wireless Apple AirPods from Amazon, and received the device which was even bigger that her head in size.
In a Twitter post, the Dubai user by the name of @Al33rzay said that when she opened the package, the fake AirPods left her speechless
"So today I received my airpods from Amazon. God these are huge," she tweeted.
"I got the AirPods from Amazon last month. I knew they were fake because Amazon sells weird stuff, and it wasn't expensive. I was shocked not going to lie, but we move on," she added.
According to a report in New York Post, the lady spent nearly $62 (Dh227.73) for the fake AirPods, which normally retail for more than three times the price.
Her post featureing a photo of the giant AirPods received more than 72,000 retweets.
Most users compared the fake airpods with a hairdryer.
"Most of you saying it's hairdryer. But I say it's 'eardryer,'" she said.
Amazon did not comment on her tweet or the report but the tweet was deleted later, saying it contains "potentially sensitive content".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Woman orders bogus AirPods off Amazon bigger than her head</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Maybe they’re AirPods for an elephant.
An online shopper in Dubai who ordered fake Apple AirPods on Amazon in March was stunned when she opened the package to find that they are bigger than her head.
“I got the AirPods from Amazon last month,” said Aleezay in Twitter post last week. “I knew they were fake because Amazon sells weird stuff, and it wasn’t expensive. I was shocked not going to lie, but we move on.”
She said she spent the equivalent of $62 for the fake AirPods, which normally retail for more than three times the price. Her post, which features a photo of the giant AirPods, received more than 72,000 retweets.
“Most of you saying it’s hairdryer. But I say it’s ‘eardryer,'” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 17 best sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sometimes you just want to escape your real life and get immersed in the futuristic, mind-bending worlds of science fiction. Luckily, Netflix has you covered.
The streaming site has a strong selection of sci-fi movies to choose from. Standouts include genre classics such as “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” and “The Matrix,” as well as the dimension-hopping superhero film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” There are also numerous science fiction thrillers available to stream, such as “Moon” and “Inception.”
Here are 17 great sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now.
Note: Numerous Netflix titles drop off the service monthly, so the availability of titles below may change.
Insider has many movie and TV show lists to keep you occupied. You can read them all here.
Netflix description: “In a smog-choked dystopian Los Angeles, blade runner Rick Deckard is called out of retirement to snuff a quartet of escaped ‘replicants.'”
Why you should watch: Widely regarded as a sci-fi classic, “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” is equal parts cyberpunk thriller and noir detective story.
Touching on common questions of the genre (such as what it means to be human, and how closely artificial intelligence can copy that humanity), director Ridley Scott’s masterpiece is further enhanced thanks to the final cut’s extra footage not featured in the movie’s theatrical release.
Netflix description: “A computer hacker learns that what most people perceive as reality is actually a simulation created by machines, and joins a rebellion to break free.”
Why you should watch: With its mind-boggling worldbuilding and ambitious, martial arts-inspired action sequences, the Wachowskis’ tech odyssey captivated audiences when it first hit theaters in 1999.
With the recent Keanu Reeves renaissance in full swing thanks to the “John Wick” franchise, the Netflix rom-com “Always Be My Maybe,” and more, now is as good a time as any to get acquainted with one of the actor’s most well-known roles.
Netflix description: “In a near-future world, single people are hunted and forced to find mates within 45 days, or be turned into animals and banished to the wilderness.”
Why you should watch: While the basic premise of “The Lobster” sounds reminiscent of a dystopian version of “The Bachelor,” the film soon morphs into a strangely moving rumination on the struggle to find love in a society rooted in aspirational coupledom.
Fans of director Yorgos Lanthimos’ most recent movie “The Favourite” will likely enjoy the similar brand of absurdist tragicomedy on display here.
Netflix description: “The Earth’s remaining inhabitants are confined to a single train circling the globe as revolution brews among the class-divided cars.”
Why you should watch: “Snowpiercer” has the same sharp class-structure criticisms that defined director Bong Joon Ho’s best picture-winning “Parasite,” delivered within an ultra-violent, absurdist post-apocalyptic world that’s thrilling to experience.
Marvel fans are also sure to enjoy seeing actor Chris Evans in the lead role of grizzled rebel Curtis, a character worlds away from Captain America.
Netflix description: “A coder at a tech company wins a week-long retreat at the compound of his company’s CEO, where he’s tasked with testing a new artificial intelligence.”
Why you should watch: Smart, sleek, and unsettling, “Ex Machina” uses artificial intelligence to explore how our preexisting ideas about gender and sexuality factor into our understanding of what it means to be human.
There’s also a trio of standout performances from Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander. Plus, it has a great Isaac-centric dance sequence.
Netflix description: “In a Los Angeles of the slight future, a lonely writer develops a relationship with ‘Samantha,’ an insightful and sensitive artificial entity.”
Why you should watch: As technology continues to transform our world, movies must grapple with its positive and negative effects in a nuanced way. “Her” manages to do just that, following the budding romance between recently single writer Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) and sentient voice operating system Samantha (Scarlett Johansson).
Through exploring their unconventional relationship, the movie unpacks the extent to which the bonds we form and maintain online compare to in-person connections, an easily compelling topic for contemporary, tech-savvy audiences.
Netflix description: “In this mind-bending sci-fi thriller, a man runs an espionage business built around entering the subconscious of his targets to mold their thoughts.”
Why you should watch: Following up the Oscar-winning superhero drama “The Dark Knight” is no easy task, but director Christopher Nolan certainly rose to the challenge with “Inception.”
Featuring a star-studded cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, the film is a visually stunning blockbuster with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end.
Netflix description: “After being bitten by a radioactive spider, Brooklyn teen Miles Morales gets a crash course in web-slinging from his alternate-dimension counterparts.”
Why you should watch: Yes, “Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse” is also a superhero movie, but its vibrantly imaginative exploration of parallel universes is part of what makes it so great.
Remixing the superhero origin story with the introduction of multiple Spider-Men, “Into the Spiderverse’s” message that anyone can be a hero appeals to adults and kids alike.
Netflix description: “As he nears the end of a lonely three-year stint on the moon base Sarang, Sam Bell begins to hear and see strange things.”
Why you should watch: Oscar winner Sam Rockwell gives what is arguably his best performance to date in “Moon,” a one-man space story that will appeal to fans of haunting, retro sci-fi like “Alien” and “2001: A Space Odyssey.”
Netflix description: “A seductive alien prowls the streets in search of prey: unsuspecting men who fall under her spell, only to be consumed by a strange liquid pool.”
Why you should watch: Scarlett Johansson leads “Under the Skin” as an alien femme fatale in this mesmerizing original movie, making it one that fans of the genre shouldn’t miss.
With its intriguing premise and a career-best performance from Johansson, the indie film is as absorbing as it is horrifying.
Netflix description: “A going-away party in Manhattan is interrupted when a mysterious monster of epic proportions launches an attack on New York City.”
Why you should watch: One of the most original science fiction projects of the 2000s, this J.J. Abrams-produced monster movie stands apart by using a first-person, found-footage perspective not commonly seen in the sci-fi genre.
The result is a mashup of “Blair Witch Project” and “Godzilla” that calls to mind 1950s monster movies – in the best way.
Netflix description: “A gentle giant and the girl who raised her are caught in the crossfire between animal activism, corporate greed, and scientific ethics.”
Why you should watch: Before “Parasite,” Bong Joon Ho also wrote and directed “Okja.” Stars like Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton round out the genre-defying adventure, in which a young South Korean girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) fights to rescue her beloved, genetically engineered “superpig” from the clutches of an exploitative, multinational conglomerate.
Deftly balancing its satire of corporate evil, coming-of-age narrative, and intercontinental action sequences, “Okja” is an eclectic, engrossing movie experience.
Netflix description: “After the world’s top scientists disappear, orphaned April secretly forges ahead with a family experiment and gets tangled up in a vast conspiracy.”
Why you should watch: “April and the Extraordinary World” follows a girl who lives in an alternate, steampunk version of France and tries to carry on her family’s mission of creating a serum that grants its users immortality.
Animation fans will undoubtedly relish the movie’s blend of whimsical design and steampunk aesthetics, while children are bound to delight in its zanier elements – a talking cat, anyone?
Netflix description: “A young Han Solo tries to settle an old score with the help of his new buddy Chewbacca, a crew of space smugglers, and a cunning old friend.”
Why you should watch: “Solo: A Star Wars Story” is the only “Star Wars” movie that isn’t solely available to stream on Disney Plus, making it a solid pick for Netflix users who want to visit a galaxy far, far away without committing to another streaming service.
It’s also worth watching for Donald Glover’s magnetic performance as a young, enviably fashionable Lando Calrissian.
Netflix description: “In order to keep her job at a biomedical engineering firm that prizes youth, a middle-aged woman must submit to a drastic experimental procedure.”
Why you should watch: Jacqueline Kim stars in this underrated futuristic gem as Gwen, a single mother who agrees to be one of the first test subjects in a procedure that transfers a person’s consciousness into a new body. Having recently been fired in a world where women (particularly older women and women of color) have few opportunities, she goes through with the procedure to ensure that her daughter Jules (Samantha Kim) has a brighter future.
“Advantageous” uses the sci-fi trope of uploading one’s consciousness to grappl ewith the timely issues that give women fewer opportunities to support themselves and has an ending that will stay with you long after the movie finishes.
Netflix description: “Eccentric inventor Doc Brown turns a DeLorean into a time machine that inadvertently sends his young friend, Marty McFly, 30 years into the past.”
Why you should watch it: This sci-fi classic perfectly balances its wacky, lovable characters, madcap time travel adventures, and sweet exploration of growing up and realizing that your parents were once just like you. “Back to the Future” is one of the most enduring ’80s blockbusters, and has a fantastic soundtrack to boot.
Netflix description: “Marty and Doc are at it again in this sequel to the 1985 blockbuster as the time-traveling duo head to 2015 to nip some McFly family woes in the bud.”
Why you should watch it: Although “Back to the Future Part II” never quite holds a candle to its beloved predecessor, it’s well worth watching for its imaginative rendering of the then-future.
Since 2015 is already a year of the past, it’s also particularly fun to note what the movie got right and wrong about life in the 2010s (for better or for worse, we still haven’t quite figured out flying cars yet).

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 17 best sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sometimes you just want to escape your real life and get immersed in the futuristic, mind-bending worlds of science fiction. Luckily, Netflix has you covered.
The streaming site has a strong selection of sci-fi movies to choose from. Standouts include genre classics such as “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” and “The Matrix,” as well as the dimension-hopping superhero film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” There are also numerous science fiction thrillers available to stream, such as “Moon” and “Inception.”
Here are 17 great sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now.
Note: Numerous Netflix titles drop off the service monthly, so the availability of titles below may change.
Insider has many movie and TV show lists to keep you occupied. You can read them all here.
Netflix description: “In a smog-choked dystopian Los Angeles, blade runner Rick Deckard is called out of retirement to snuff a quartet of escaped ‘replicants.'”
Why you should watch: Widely regarded as a sci-fi classic, “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” is equal parts cyberpunk thriller and noir detective story.
Touching on common questions of the genre (such as what it means to be human, and how closely artificial intelligence can copy that humanity), director Ridley Scott’s masterpiece is further enhanced thanks to the final cut’s extra footage not featured in the movie’s theatrical release.
Netflix description: “A computer hacker learns that what most people perceive as reality is actually a simulation created by machines, and joins a rebellion to break free.”
Why you should watch: With its mind-boggling worldbuilding and ambitious, martial arts-inspired action sequences, the Wachowskis’ tech odyssey captivated audiences when it first hit theaters in 1999.
With the recent Keanu Reeves renaissance in full swing thanks to the “John Wick” franchise, the Netflix rom-com “Always Be My Maybe,” and more, now is as good a time as any to get acquainted with one of the actor’s most well-known roles.
Netflix description: “In a near-future world, single people are hunted and forced to find mates within 45 days, or be turned into animals and banished to the wilderness.”
Why you should watch: While the basic premise of “The Lobster” sounds reminiscent of a dystopian version of “The Bachelor,” the film soon morphs into a strangely moving rumination on the struggle to find love in a society rooted in aspirational coupledom.
Fans of director Yorgos Lanthimos’ most recent movie “The Favourite” will likely enjoy the similar brand of absurdist tragicomedy on display here.
Netflix description: “The Earth’s remaining inhabitants are confined to a single train circling the globe as revolution brews among the class-divided cars.”
Why you should watch: “Snowpiercer” has the same sharp class-structure criticisms that defined director Bong Joon Ho’s best picture-winning “Parasite,” delivered within an ultra-violent, absurdist post-apocalyptic world that’s thrilling to experience.
Marvel fans are also sure to enjoy seeing actor Chris Evans in the lead role of grizzled rebel Curtis, a character worlds away from Captain America.
Netflix description: “A coder at a tech company wins a week-long retreat at the compound of his company’s CEO, where he’s tasked with testing a new artificial intelligence.”
Why you should watch: Smart, sleek, and unsettling, “Ex Machina” uses artificial intelligence to explore how our preexisting ideas about gender and sexuality factor into our understanding of what it means to be human.
There’s also a trio of standout performances from Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander. Plus, it has a great Isaac-centric dance sequence.
Netflix description: “In a Los Angeles of the slight future, a lonely writer develops a relationship with ‘Samantha,’ an insightful and sensitive artificial entity.”
Why you should watch: As technology continues to transform our world, movies must grapple with its positive and negative effects in a nuanced way. “Her” manages to do just that, following the budding romance between recently single writer Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) and sentient voice operating system Samantha (Scarlett Johansson).
Through exploring their unconventional relationship, the movie unpacks the extent to which the bonds we form and maintain online compare to in-person connections, an easily compelling topic for contemporary, tech-savvy audiences.
Netflix description: “In this mind-bending sci-fi thriller, a man runs an espionage business built around entering the subconscious of his targets to mold their thoughts.”
Why you should watch: Following up the Oscar-winning superhero drama “The Dark Knight” is no easy task, but director Christopher Nolan certainly rose to the challenge with “Inception.”
Featuring a star-studded cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, the film is a visually stunning blockbuster with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end.
Netflix description: “After being bitten by a radioactive spider, Brooklyn teen Miles Morales gets a crash course in web-slinging from his alternate-dimension counterparts.”
Why you should watch: Yes, “Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse” is also a superhero movie, but its vibrantly imaginative exploration of parallel universes is part of what makes it so great.
Remixing the superhero origin story with the introduction of multiple Spider-Men, “Into the Spiderverse’s” message that anyone can be a hero appeals to adults and kids alike.
Netflix description: “As he nears the end of a lonely three-year stint on the moon base Sarang, Sam Bell begins to hear and see strange things.”
Why you should watch: Oscar winner Sam Rockwell gives what is arguably his best performance to date in “Moon,” a one-man space story that will appeal to fans of haunting, retro sci-fi like “Alien” and “2001: A Space Odyssey.”
Netflix description: “A seductive alien prowls the streets in search of prey: unsuspecting men who fall under her spell, only to be consumed by a strange liquid pool.”
Why you should watch: Scarlett Johansson leads “Under the Skin” as an alien femme fatale in this mesmerizing original movie, making it one that fans of the genre shouldn’t miss.
With its intriguing premise and a career-best performance from Johansson, the indie film is as absorbing as it is horrifying.
Netflix description: “A going-away party in Manhattan is interrupted when a mysterious monster of epic proportions launches an attack on New York City.”
Why you should watch: One of the most original science fiction projects of the 2000s, this J.J. Abrams-produced monster movie stands apart by using a first-person, found-footage perspective not commonly seen in the sci-fi genre.
The result is a mashup of “Blair Witch Project” and “Godzilla” that calls to mind 1950s monster movies – in the best way.
Netflix description: “A gentle giant and the girl who raised her are caught in the crossfire between animal activism, corporate greed, and scientific ethics.”
Why you should watch: Before “Parasite,” Bong Joon Ho also wrote and directed “Okja.” Stars like Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton round out the genre-defying adventure, in which a young South Korean girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) fights to rescue her beloved, genetically engineered “superpig” from the clutches of an exploitative, multinational conglomerate.
Deftly balancing its satire of corporate evil, coming-of-age narrative, and intercontinental action sequences, “Okja” is an eclectic, engrossing movie experience.
Netflix description: “After the world’s top scientists disappear, orphaned April secretly forges ahead with a family experiment and gets tangled up in a vast conspiracy.”
Why you should watch: “April and the Extraordinary World” follows a girl who lives in an alternate, steampunk version of France and tries to carry on her family’s mission of creating a serum that grants its users immortality.
Animation fans will undoubtedly relish the movie’s blend of whimsical design and steampunk aesthetics, while children are bound to delight in its zanier elements – a talking cat, anyone?
Netflix description: “A young Han Solo tries to settle an old score with the help of his new buddy Chewbacca, a crew of space smugglers, and a cunning old friend.”
Why you should watch: “Solo: A Star Wars Story” is the only “Star Wars” movie that isn’t solely available to stream on Disney Plus, making it a solid pick for Netflix users who want to visit a galaxy far, far away without committing to another streaming service.
It’s also worth watching for Donald Glover’s magnetic performance as a young, enviably fashionable Lando Calrissian.
Netflix description: “In order to keep her job at a biomedical engineering firm that prizes youth, a middle-aged woman must submit to a drastic experimental procedure.”
Why you should watch: Jacqueline Kim stars in this underrated futuristic gem as Gwen, a single mother who agrees to be one of the first test subjects in a procedure that transfers a person’s consciousness into a new body. Having recently been fired in a world where women (particularly older women and women of color) have few opportunities, she goes through with the procedure to ensure that her daughter Jules (Samantha Kim) has a brighter future.
“Advantageous” uses the sci-fi trope of uploading one’s consciousness to grappl ewith the timely issues that give women fewer opportunities to support themselves and has an ending that will stay with you long after the movie finishes.
Netflix description: “Eccentric inventor Doc Brown turns a DeLorean into a time machine that inadvertently sends his young friend, Marty McFly, 30 years into the past.”
Why you should watch it: This sci-fi classic perfectly balances its wacky, lovable characters, madcap time travel adventures, and sweet exploration of growing up and realizing that your parents were once just like you. “Back to the Future” is one of the most enduring ’80s blockbusters, and has a fantastic soundtrack to boot.
Netflix description: “Marty and Doc are at it again in this sequel to the 1985 blockbuster as the time-traveling duo head to 2015 to nip some McFly family woes in the bud.”
Why you should watch it: Although “Back to the Future Part II” never quite holds a candle to its beloved predecessor, it’s well worth watching for its imaginative rendering of the then-future.
Since 2015 is already a year of the past, it’s also particularly fun to note what the movie got right and wrong about life in the 2010s (for better or for worse, we still haven’t quite figured out flying cars yet).

But after that comes your rise, And rise you will and be so wise. I wish today, sadness dwindles. I wish today, suffering ends. -AS."

This is Sia’s second single in 2020, the first being “Original” from the motion-picture soundtrack of Dolittle back in January.

Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik are expecting their first child, the supermodel told US talkshow host Jimmy Fallon Friday.
Hadid has been dating Malik on-and-off since 2015, celebrating her 25th birthday with him in quarantine on her mother’s Pennsylvania farm last weekend.
US media had reported she was pregnant after family sources spoke to TMZ.
“Obviously, you know, we wish we could’ve announced it on our own terms, but we’re very excited and happy and grateful for everyone’s well wishes and support,” Hadid told Fallon via video-link.

She is quarantining in New Hope, roughly 30 miles outside Philadelphia with Malik, her mother Yolanda Hadid, sister Bella and friend Leah McCarthy.
But Hadid — who has modeled for Chanel and Victoria’s Secret among others — said it was a “nice silver lining to be able to be home, be together, and really experience it day by day.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gigi Hadid’s ex Tyler Cameron ‘excited’ about her pregnancy news</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gigi Hadid’s ex-boyfriend Tyler Cameron has nothing but nice words to say about his former love, admitting he’s ‘excited’ about her pregnancy news.
The Victoria’s Secret model is currently expecting her first child with boyfriend Zayn Malik just a few months after the pair reconciled their on-off five-year relationship. 
During their recent split, Gigi, 25, moved on and dated Bachelorette star Tyler for a short while before reuniting with Zayn. 
Reacting to the model’s baby news, Tyler said on ESPN West Palm on Saturday: ‘If anything, I’m excited for her. I’m happy for her. She’s gonna be an incredible mother.’ 
Over the past week, Tyler’s been subjected to odd rumours that he’s actually the father of Gigi’s unborn child due to their recent relationship. 
But shutting down the speculation, the reality star stated: ‘No, no, but she’s going to be the most incredible mother. She’s a caring sweet person and she’s gonna be amazing.’ 
He had previously responded to fans on social media: ‘Y’all are wrong in the comments. Y’all are terrible,’ when they began commenting that he was the dad. 
Gigi confirmed the joyful news of her pregnancy during an interview with The Tonight Show’s Jimmy Fallon. 
‘Obviously we wish we could have announced it on our own terms but we’re very excited and happy, and grateful for everyone’s well-wishes and support,’ Gigi told the host in their video interview. 
‘It definitely wasn’t bad news and we’re happy now to be excited about it. 
When host Jimmy urged her not to overdo anything, and ‘be present’ for every part of her pregnancy, she insisted: ‘I’m trying. Especially during this time, it’s a nice silver lining to be able to be home and together and really experience it, day by day.’ 
It comes after TMZ reported Gigi was around 20 weeks pregnant and had told her family that she and Zayn were expecting a little one. 
Eagle-eyed fans then noticed that Gigi’s recent 25th birthday celebrations may have also doubled up as a baby shower, with ‘it’s a girl’ decorations spotted in her Instagram stories.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik are expecting their first child, and it's a girl! According to a source close to the couple, Gigi is 20 weeks along, so they decided to find out the baby's sex. "At the end of the day it didn't matter to the couple what the sex was, but now they can prepare for the new addition before she arrives," the source told ET.
The model and the former One Direction singer's pregnancy news broke just days after Gigi's 25th birthday celebrations. We can't wait to meet this baby girl when she's born — likely midway through September!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gigi Hadid's ex-boyfriend, Tyler Cameron, predicts she will be an 'incredible' mother</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gigi Hadid’s former lover Tyler Cameron has praised the model and predicts she will be an “incredible” mother as he gushed about the Real Housewives of Beverley Hills star.
Gigi and her boyfriend Zayn Malik, 27, delighted fans last month when they revealed they were expecting their first child together following five years of on-and-off dating.
Bachelorette hunk Tyler, 27, enjoyed a whirlwind romance with 25-year-old Gigi between August and October last year while she was on a relationship hiatus from One Direction star Zayn.
And while the romance may have been brief, Tyler says he has enough insight on Gigi’s personality to give a glowing opinion of how she will be as a mother.
Speaking to ESPN West Palm, Tyler gushed: “If anything, I'm excited for her. I'm happy for her. She's gonna be an incredible mother.”
The reality star also laughed off the suggestion that the baby could be his.
Asked about being the father, he replied: “No, no, but she's going to be the most incredible mother. She's a caring sweet person and she's gonna be amazing.”
Tyler’s nervous rejection of the suggestion he could be the father of Gigi’s child followed a similar line of questioning from fans during an Instagram Live chat Tyler held last week.
In the comments section of the chat, one cheeky follower wrote: “Congrats on becoming the father. Gigi is preg.”
But Tyler was quick to knock down the joke, replying: “Y’all are wrong in the comments. Y'all are terrible.”
Last week Gigi beamed about becoming a first time mother during an appearance on Jimmy Fallon’s late night talk show.
"We're very excited and happy and grateful for everyone's well wishes and support," Gigi gushed
And while Zayn himself is yet to publicly comment on becoming a father, Gigi added: "It's a nice silver lining to be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tyler Cameron Gushes Ex Gigi Will Be An ‘Incredible Mother’ After She Confirms Pregnancy With Zayn</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">How kind! Tyler Cameron, 27, said the most precious things about his former fling Gigi Hadid, 25, after word broke that she’s expecting her first child with boyfriend Zayn Malik, 27. He did this during an interview with Josh Cohen and the Home Team on ESPN West Palm earlier this week where the former Bachelor star thinks she’s going to do A-OK if not better in the world of motherhood. “If anything, I am excited for her, I am happy for her,” he gushed while adding, “She is going to be an incredible mother.” Aww! Tyler also denied the rumor that he is the father of the supermodel’s child during the chat. “No, no, but she is going to be the most incredible mother. She’s a caring, sweet person and she’s going to be amazing.”
This isn’t the first time that Tyler has shut down any speculation that he’s the baby daddy. He did an Instagram Live with his fans on Wednesday, April 29, where one of them dropped the allegation. “Congrats on becoming the father. Gigi is preg,” they wrote. He appeared to respond to their words by simply saying, “Y’all are wrong in the comments. Y’all are terrible.” The studly reality star has had his fair share of women he’s been linked to outside of Gigi over the past year that also include Kylie Jenner‘s BFF Stassie Karanikolaou, 22, and, of course, Hannah Brown, 25.
Gigi finally confirmed the news that she’s pregnant and that Zayn is indeed the dad during a pre-taped appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday, April 30. “Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms, but we’re very excited and happy and grateful for everyone’s well wishes and support,” she revealed.
So many celebs have been announcing their joyous baby news lately! Other A-list stars that are currently expecting include Lea Michele and Zandy Reich, Chris Pratt and Katherine Schwarzenengger and Ashlee Simpson and Evan Ross. The former Glee star shared her first baby bump photo on Saturday, May 2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Star filmmakers draw inspiration from Russia lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic might have brought the film industry to a halt but Andrei Konchalovsky, one of Russia's most renowned film and theatre directors, is as busy as ever.
He wants to make a documentary about daily life under quarantine, exploring the poetic side of the mundane, and he has invited ordinary Russians to work with him on the project.
"All of us have ended up on a desert island and that's the most interesting thing," the 82-year-old told AFP in a video interview.
In late March, Konchalovsky issued a call on social media to his fans to make short videos for a project he has called "Quarantine Russian Style".
"Take your smartphones, film your new routines, your favourite spot at home, or even your work web conference. And we'll make movies!" he said.
Every week the celebrated filmmaker, who is followed by more than 400,000 people on Facebook, asks his co-creators a number of questions.
He wants them to speak about their fears or new rituals or even tell him about the "craziest" thing they have purchased during the lockdown.
Konchalovsky, who has earned multiple international awards and worked with renowned filmmaker Andrey Tarkovsky, has already received thousands of video clips and photos to choose from.
"They shoot them from their room, a decrepit window sill or a favourite old sofa," he said.
Sometimes contributors read out a text or wax philosophical about Russians' coping mechanisms.
Scenes have included Russians sharing a vodka bottle at a makeshift table connecting two nearby balconies or riding a bike to a neighbour's door.
Konchalovsky, who lived in the United States for many years and whose Hollywood movies include "Tango and Cash", also asked aspiring filmmakers to reflect on the nature of the quarantine in Russia and how it may be different from lockdowns in China or Europe.
The film director said his countrymen might adapt better to crises than people in the West.
"Specifics of life in Russia have fostered in man an enormous ability to resist sanctions,"  he said. 
"That is why we will be able to tough it out."
'Tales from Quarantine'
Konchalovsky is not the only filmmaker to have found new inspiration during the lockdown.
Director and producer Timur Bekmambetov, who is regarded as one of the inventors of the "Screenlife" format, in which movies take place entirely on computer screens, wants to produce a film about the lockdown in the new genre.
Like Konchalovsky, he has invited Russians to contribute short videos and script pitches for a project he has called "Tales From The Quarantine". 
The crowd-sourced stories could be real or fictional.
"Today we live more and more on our screens rather than in real life: it's where we fall in love, get angry, where we find and lose work and understand who we are," Bekmambetov told AFP in a video interview from the city of Kazan more than 800 kilometres (500 miles) east of Moscow.
The first episode is called "Telecommuting" and features professional actors in a web conference.
"Confinement speeds up usage of a new audiovisual language," said Bekmambetov, 58, who shot to fame in the 2000s when he directed Russian fantasy thrillers "Day Watch" and "Night Watch".
"Traditional cinema, which has come to a standstill during the crisis, is outdated," he said.
"We no longer want movies about bank heists in the era of electronic payments or balcony serenades in time of social networks."
'We must survive'
Due to the epidemic, the Russian film industry is likely to lose around 60 percent of revenue this year, according to preliminary estimates from the culture ministry.
But online platforms still offer an opportunity to earn an income. This is what Galiya Fatkhutdinova, who makes short films, hopes to do.
The 35-year-old was giving acting classes in China when the coronavirus epidemic struck. 
Stuck in quarantine, she decided to launch a series of short films to document the experience upon her return to Russia. 
She invited dozens of her actor friends -- who had all lost their jobs due to the contagion -- to participate in a project dubbed "The Isolated".
"'The Isolated' talks about everything that goes on in isolation: love, betrayal, politics," Fatkhutdinova told AFP.
She is now looking to sell her film to an online platform -- one of the few distribution possibilities left during the lockdown -- to be able to pay her actors.
"We must survive these strange times," she said.

But online platforms still offer an opportunity to earn an income. This is what Galiya Fatkhutdinova, who makes short films, hopes to do.
The 35-year-old was giving acting classes in China when the coronavirus epidemic struck.
Stuck in quarantine, she decided to launch a series of short films to document the experience upon her return to Russia.
She invited dozens of her actor friends -- who had all lost their jobs due to the contagion -- to participate in a project dubbed "The Isolated".
"'The Isolated' talks about everything that goes on in isolation: love, betrayal, politics," Fatkhutdinova told AFP.
She is now looking to sell her film to an online platform -- one of the few distribution possibilities left during the lockdown -- to be able to pay her actors.
"We must survive these strange times," she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Star filmmakers draw inspiration from Russia lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic might have brought the film industry to a halt but Andrei Konchalovsky, one of Russia's most renowned film and theatre directors, is as busy as ever.
He wants to make a documentary about daily life under quarantine, exploring the poetic side of the mundane, and he has invited ordinary Russians to work with him on the project.
"All of us have ended up on a desert island and that's the most interesting thing," the 82-year-old told AFP in a video interview.
In late March, Konchalovsky issued a call on social media to his fans to make short videos for a project he has called "Quarantine Russian Style".
"Take your smartphones, film your new routines, your favourite spot at home, or even your work web conference. And we'll make movies!" he said.
Every week the celebrated filmmaker, who is followed by more than 400,000 people on Facebook, asks his co-creators a number of questions.
He wants them to speak about their fears or new rituals or even tell him about the "craziest" thing they have purchased during the lockdown.
Konchalovsky, who has earned multiple international awards and worked with renowned filmmaker Andrey Tarkovsky, has already received thousands of video clips and photos to choose from.
"They shoot them from their room, a decrepit window sill or a favourite old sofa," he said.
Sometimes contributors read out a text or wax philosophical about Russians' coping mechanisms.
Scenes have included Russians sharing a vodka bottle at a makeshift table connecting two nearby balconies or riding a bike to a neighbour's door.
Konchalovsky, who lived in the United States for many years and whose Hollywood movies include "Tango and Cash", also asked aspiring filmmakers to reflect on the nature of the quarantine in Russia and how it may be different from lockdowns in China or Europe.
The film director said his countrymen might adapt better to crises than people in the West.
"Specifics of life in Russia have fostered in man an enormous ability to resist sanctions,"  he said.
"That is why we will be able to tough it out."
Konchalovsky is not the only filmmaker to have found new inspiration during the lockdown.
Director and producer Timur Bekmambetov, who is regarded as one of the inventors of the "Screenlife" format, in which movies take place entirely on computer screens, wants to produce a film about the lockdown in the new genre.
Like Konchalovsky, he has invited Russians to contribute short videos and script pitches for a project he has called "Tales From The Quarantine".
The crowd-sourced stories could be real or fictional.
"Today we live more and more on our screens rather than in real life: it's where we fall in love, get angry, where we find and lose work and understand who we are," Bekmambetov told AFP in a video interview from the city of Kazan more than 800 kilometres (500 miles) east of Moscow.
The first episode is called "Telecommuting" and features professional actors in a web conference.
"Confinement speeds up usage of a new audiovisual language," said Bekmambetov, 58, who shot to fame in the 2000s when he directed Russian fantasy thrillers "Day Watch" and "Night Watch".
"Traditional cinema, which has come to a standstill during the crisis, is outdated," he said.
"We no longer want movies about bank heists in the era of electronic payments or balcony serenades in time of social networks."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YouTube have deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke’s account.
The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus.
The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including a discredited theory that it is linked to the 5G mobile network.
The video service, owned by Google, told the BBC: “YouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS.
“Due to continued violation of these policies we have terminated David Icke’s YouTube channel.”
The ban follows a similar move by Facebook, who removed Icke’s page from their site on Friday.
Famous medics including Dr Christian Jessen and former junior doctor Adam Kay have called on social networks to remove Icke from their platforms.
They are backed by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), who claim Icke’s conspiracies over Covid-19 have been viewed more than 30 million times.
“We commend YouTube on bowing to pressure and taking action on David Icke’s channel,” said CCDH’s chief executive Imran Ahmed.
“However, there remains a network of channels and shadowy amplifiers, who promote Mr Icke’s content (and) need to be removed.”
They asked for other networks to follow the lead, and added: “It is time for Instagram and Twitter to follow Facebook and YouTube by acting to remove Icke and his content from their platforms.
“Lies cost lives in a global pandemic, and their failure to act promptly puts us all at risk.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">David Icke Booted From Facebook For Spreading COVID-19 ‘Conspiracy Theories’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">David Icke is no stranger to controversy, and has in the past, among other things, claimed that the world in governed by a secret cabal of extraterrestrial reptiles and that the British Royal Family are lizards.
Facebook has removed the official page of renowned conspiracy theorist David Icke after he made a controversial post about the origins of COVID-19.
Mr Icke had reportedly shared a number videos in which he made claims that the Coronavirus pandemic is linked to 5G networks, while in another he said that the disease had been spread by a Jewish group.
The social media giant said that it had removed Mr Icke from its website for “repeatedly violating our policies on harmful information.”
Following his removal from Facebook, Mr Icke then stormed to Twitter to slam the company as “fascist” for deleting his page. Furthermore, Mr Icke shared a picture of Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, with the caption, “The little boy gofer for global tyranny.”
Mr Icke’s now deleted Facebook page boasted almost 800,000 followers when it was removed.
The Centre for Countering Digital Hate said in an open letter calling for Mr Icke's banning from social media that his conspiracies about Coronavirus had been viewed more than 30 million times.
Its chief executive, Imran Ahmed, has been quoted as saying that the kind of information shared by Mr Icke “puts all of our lives at risk by encouraging the public not to comply with clinical guidance.”
Hope Not Hate, a UK-based campaign group, said that it, “welcome news that Facebook have removed David Icke’s page.”
They went on to add that, “he [Mr Icke] has promoted dangerous conspiracy theories including the idea that COVID-19 is a hoax.”
Mr Ickle has also been accused on multiple occasions of using his large social media platform to spread antisemitism.
British broadcaster Rachel Riley, herself a campaigner against antisemitism, welcomed Facebook's decision, saying, “the hate preacher was banned from Australia. Big arenas have rejected him, yet social media orgs allow him a megaphone (& pocket the profits). Facebook have finally deleted him today!!”
Twitter has responded to criticism that it has not taken the same steps as Facebook by removing Mr Icke’s profile, saying that “prioritising the removal of COVID-19 content when it has a call to action that could potentially cause harm.”
Twitter has been widely quoted as saying in response that it is, “prioritising the removal of COVID-19 content when it has a call to action that could potentially cause harm.”
“As we've said previously, we will not take enforcement action on every tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19. Since introducing these policies on 18 March, we've removed more than 2,200 tweets. As we've doubled down on tech, our automated systems have challenged more than 3.4 million accounts which were targeting discussions around COVID-19 with spammy or manipulative behaviours,” a Twitter spokesperson added.
The 5G theory alleges, among other things, that Coronavirus has been caused by frequencies used for the new wireless technology which impair the human immune system. The theory has spread like wildfire across social media, with many arguing that it is in fact true. As a result, across the UK alone, there have been attacks on around 60 5G masts recorded by the authorities, most of which were set on fire.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Avengers reunited for the Kids' Choice Awards and we're in our feelings</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The stars of Avengers: Endgame reunited once more from their respective homes to collect their Kids’ Choice Awards.
The blockbuster, which ended the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s first Avengers saga, was given the award for favourite movie.
The six original Avengers – Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner, made an appearance via video from their respective homes.
Endgame, directed by the Russo brothers, saw off competition from Captain Marvel, Jumanji: The Next Level, Spider-Man: Far From Home, Aladdin and Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker.
Scarlett who played Black Widow: ‘Hey guys! Oh my gosh, this is such a thrill. We are so excited.
‘We are so happy that the Kids’ Choice Awards are still happening.’
Mark, who played Bruce Banner – aka the Hulk – added: ‘The show must go on. Life must go on. Therefore, the Avengers must go on.’
Australian actor Chris referred to his character Thor’s strength and joked: ‘We are stronger together. Amongst this group, I’m the strongest obviously, we know that.’
However Captain America star Chris Evans begged to differ and replied: ‘Well…debatable. I seem to remember beating you in a push-up contest.’
‘I’m pretty sure I was wearing the big suit with the 70-pound weight I had on my back and my stomach. So, it doesn’t count,’ Chris Hemsworth replied. Meanwhile Jeremy, who played Hawkeye, held up masks of the two Chrises and pretended to make them fight.
Scarlett said: ‘This was my life for a decade’, before Jeremy commented: ‘We thought you were..uh…’
Iron Man actor Robert then popped up to join the others and said: ‘What? Social distancing? Aren’t we all?’
Other Kids’ Choice Awards winners included Tom Holland for favourite superhero, JoJo Siwa for favourite social music star and Dwayne Johnson for favourite movie actor.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marvel's STAR WARS: DOCTOR APHRA #1 To Debut Digitally May the 4th, 3 Weeks Before Print</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marvel Comics' Star Wars: Doctor Aphra #1, the launch of the character's new ongoing series, will debut digitally on Monday, May 4, otherwise known as "May the 4th" or "Star Wars Day" to fans.
As just-announced by the publisher Friday, that means the issue will debut digitally 23 days before it's due to arrive in comic shops (via Diamond Comic Distributors' re-established distribution) on Wednesday, May 27. 
Written by Alyssa Wong with art by Marika Cresta, "the series equips Doctor Aphra with both a new crew and a new mission set in the aftermath of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back," reads Marvel's official description. "With the Rebel Alliance back on the run after their defeat at the Battle of Hoth, it’s never been a more dangerous time for outlaws, scoundrels and the errant rogue archaeologist to make their way in the galaxy. But after a string of bad luck and near escapes, Doctor Aphra has been keeping a low profile—jobs are scarce and credits scarcer. But the promise of the score of a lifetime is just too good for her to pass up."
When the issue arrives in comic book shops later in May, Marvel encourages readers to "contact your local comic shop for information about their current business policies to observe social distancing or other services they may offer, including holding or creating pull lists, curbside pick-ups, special deliveries, and other options to accommodate." 
Coincidently (or perhaps not), this is the second time Doctor Aphra #1 has been announced to debut digitally before print. 
In late March StarWars.com announced the series would debut April 1 as a digital exclusive, the same day Diamond suspended their operations, which Marvel Comics later told Newsarama was inaccurate.
The series of course did not launch digitally April 1, but the digital-first part has now seems to be coming true. 
Either way, check out a preview of Doctor Aphra #1right here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Evans assembles ‘Avengers’ stars Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner for a virtual reunion to raise funds for COVID-19 relief efforts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just a year ago fans bid their final farewell to their favourite Marvel heroes, The Avengers, in the superhit film ‘Avengers: Endgame’. Luckily, the goodbye was not for long as ‘Captain America’ star Chris Evans has announced a virtual reunion of the Original six cast members - Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner.
The actor, who finally made his Instagram debut to raise funds for the fight against the novel coronavirus, promised a fun game session, and a “virtual hangout” where lucky fans can indulge in a “private Q&A.”
Making fans an offer they can’t refuse, Chris said, “You can ask us anything. We'll spill the beans.”
Evans made his debut on the photo-sharing website on May 1 and shared that he is taking part in the All In Challenge, launched to help raise money to fight hunger during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The actor said that he feels the cause should encourage fans to join in. "This is a great cause. This helps people who are in need during this COVID nightmare. So I am very happy to be doing this."
He then passed the challenge to fellow Marvel star friends, Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie, as well as Billy Porter, with who he will be collaborating with in the upcoming film ‘Little Shop of Horrors’.
The actor's challenge page shared details that the offer of hanging out goes to one lucky winner and two friends.
"100 per cent of the money raised through this Game/Auction will go directly to Feeding America, Meals On Wheels, World Central Kitchen and No Kid Hungry," read his statement.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Disney Needs ‘Deadpool 3’ Because Its Fox Releases Have Been A Disaster</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A stand-alone Deadpool 3, starring Ryan Reynolds and existing as a 20th Century-produced blockbuster, is more valuable to Disney than Wade Wilson’s theoretical inclusion in a future MCU movie.
Today was supposed to be the “two months-out” date for Free Guy, which was scheduled to open domestically on July 3. The film, starring Ryan Reynolds as a random video game non-playable-character who becomes sentient, will now (hopefully) open on December 11. It was to be one of the big original flicks of the summer. Since the print media tends to plan far in advance, the Total Film cover story already dropped. In it, Reynolds discusses that he has little idea when, if or how Deadpool 3 will happen. Some of the mystery is related to how Kevin Feige plans to include X-Men-related mutants into the MCU, and how Deadpool might fit in. At this point, Disney might want to just make a non-MCU Deadpool sequel. Marvel doesn’t need the character, but Disney could really use a hit from their Fox IP.
While Tim Miller’s $58 million-budgeted Deadpool was technically a spin-off from the Fox X-Men franchise, with Reynolds reprising the role he first played in X-Men Origins: Wolverine seven years earlier, the film proved more popular than any X-Men movie. Heck, the film earned $363 million domestic (from a $132 million Fri-Sun/$152 million Fri-Mon President’s Day launch) and $783 million worldwide, becoming (at the time) the biggest R-rated movie ever worldwide. It passed the cumes of Guardians of the Galaxy ($333 million domestic and $773 million worldwide), meaning it had earned, at the time, more than any non-Tony Stark MCU movie ever. With decent reviews and a strong hook as a vulgar, blood-soaked, R-rated romcom superhero lark (with 99% of its violence directed at the bad guys), the film was a singular sensation beyond just being an X-Men flick or being a Marvel Comics adaptation.
David Leitch’s $110 million-budgeted Deadpool 2 opened with solid reviews and decent buzz in May of 2018 with a $128 million domestic debut. It would eventually earn $324 million domestic (counting $6 million earned by a PG-13 version titled Once Upon a Deadpool) and $785 million worldwide (again, counting $44 million earned, including $24 million in China, by the PG-13 cut). The two Deadpool movies earned a combined $1.568 billion worldwide on a combined budget of $168 million. Had Fox not been bought by Disney, a process which began in late 2017 and culminated in early 2019, there’d probably already be a Deadpool 3 (or X-Force) in development. But Disney’s acquisition of Fox’s movie and TV departments, which eventually resulted in the studio being renamed “20th Century Pictures,” complicated everything. What roles would Deadpool and the X-Men play in future MCU movies?
Yes, there is the issue of both Deadpool movies being R-rated carnage-fests, but that’s less of an issue as it’s not like they didn’t release Fox Searchlight’s R-rated Ready Or Not to relative success ($58 million worldwide on a $6 million budget). An R-rated Deadpool 3, disconnected to any continuity save for Deadpool and Deadpool 2,released by 20th Century Pictures would be entirely sans controversy or complication. No, the real complication is related to whether a Deadpool 3 would take place within the MCU, since that inclusion would bring about questions in terms of MPAA ratings, fourth-wall-breaking and related elements that make Deadpool unique in terms of current superhero franchises. However, Kevin Feige’s Marvel Cinematic Universe is doing just fine without the X-Men. Moreover, Disney could really use a theatrical success with a Fox-specific IP right now.
When these talks first began in November of 2019, it stood to reason that Disney was buying Fox partially for its ability to produce and/or distribute comparatively adult-skewing biggies (War For thePlanet of the Apes, Murder on the Orient Express, Prometheus, Logan, Gone Girl, etc.) and Oscar-friendly (and/or Oscar-winning) hits like 12 Years a Slave, Birdman, The Shape of Water and The Post. In terms of kid-friendly fare, they would score two biggies at Christmas, namely Blue Sky’s Ferdinand ($296 million worldwide)and The Greatest Showman (which legged out to $184 million domestic from a $13.5 million Wed-Sun launch, one of the leggiest wide openers ever). But then Fox’s 2018 was frankly a year from hell. Save for Deadpool 2 and Bohemian Rhapsody ($905 million worldwide), almost every other Fox flick stumbled or bombed. Things did not improve in 2019.
The problem wasn’t the movies, as they had original black dramedies (Bad Times at the El Royale), hot-button melodramas (The Hate U Give), Oscar-friendly thrillers (Widows), promising YA fantasies (The Darkest Minds), adult-skewing, star-driven thrillers (Jennifer Lawrence’s Red Sparrow) and geek-friendly franchises (The Predator). Alas, the demographic shift that caused audiences that once went to the movies just to see a movie to consume their filmed entertainment at home via VOD or streaming, was a killing blow to Fox’s line-up of “what we claim we want in theaters” 2018 releases. 2019 saw The Kid Who Would Be King outright bomb while Alita: Battle Angel almost became a hit with $405 million from a $170 million budget. Ironically, its run in China ($133 million) was undercut by China’s increased fandom for Marvel/DC superhero movies. Except, of course, for Dark Phoenix.
Dark Phoenix was every bit a disaster as predicted. While X-Men: Apocalypse had earned a then-huge $123 million in China two summers ago toward a face-saving $543 million global cume, they didn’t like that movie any more than we did. Dark Phoenix would earn just $59 million in China (along with $65 million in North America) toward a miserable $252 million global cume. Fox’s first year of “Disney released” pictures was a disaster, with two small-scale hits (Ready Or Not and the faith-based Breakthrough), a buzzy Oscar flick (Jojo Rabbit, which earned $90 million global), an under-performing biggie (Ford v Ferrari, which earned $107 million domestic but just $225 million worldwide on a $97 million budget) and a slew of whiffs (Terminator: Dark Fate, Stuber, Ad Astra, Spies in Disguise, etc.). The movies were (mostly) good, but folks didn’t show up.
At their worst, Walt Disney falls into the realm of “evil, not stupid.” As much as we hand-wring about Disney shuttering Fox 2000, putting The Mouse Guard in turnaround or severely cutting down on the number of theatrically released 20th Century/Searchlight releases, that’s at least partially market-driven. If audiences showed up to Bad Times at the El Royale or Widows, we’d get more of their ilk. If audiences showed up for Tomorrowland and Queen of Katwe alongside Inside Out and Rogue One, Disney would happily offer a more balanced cinematic diet. We all shout online and ask “Why does Disney keep green-lighting remakes to their animated movies?!” I’m going to go out on a limb and suggest it’s maybe, just maybe, because Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King earned a combined $3.96 billion in global ticket sales. If you come, they will build it.
However, looking at the various IP and brands that Disney just purchased, the only ones that arguably have any theatrical value are Kenneth Branagh’s Hercule Poirot flicks (Death on the Nile is still slated for October 9, 2020), James Cameron’s Avatar sequels, Planet of the Apes (a new sequel/installment for which is in development) and Ryan Reynolds’ Deadpool franchise. The Deadpool series, specifically the version of Deadpool played by Ryan Reynolds in the first two movies, is as valuable by itself as any MCU franchise. Besides, it’s not like Deadpool 3 would prohibit future Wade Wilson appearances in later MCU movies. Speaking specifically in terms of theatrical releases (as opposed to Disney+ and Hulu streaming), Deadpool 3’s existence as a stand-alone tentpole movie is more valuable to Disney, in terms of representing a Fox-specific blockbuster, than Deadpool appearing as another cog in the MCU.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Live-Action 'Transformers' Film Set for June 2022 Release</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paramount Pictures has dated a new, untitled live-action “Transformers” film to be released in theaters on June 24, 2022, TheWrap has confirmed.
As Paramount and Hasbro press forward to revamp the franchise, two new “Transformers” projects are being developed simultaneously, with Joby Harold (“Army of the Dead”) and James Vanderbilt (“Zodiac”) each penning a script. Plot details are being kept under wraps and no directors are currently attached to either.
Meanwhile, Josh Cooley, winner of the Oscar for Best Animated Film for “Toy Story 4,” will direct an untitled animated “Transformers” prequel with a script written by “Ant-Man and the Wasp” scribes Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari. Hasbro’s entertainment studio, eOne, will develop and produce the film along with Paramount Animation.
For years, “Transformers” was the ultimate critic-proof franchise. Reviews for films like “Revenge of the Fallen” and “Dark of the Moon” were overwhelmingly negative, but fans and families showed up in droves every summer that one of these films came out, to the tune of over $1 billion each.
“Transformers” peaked in 2011 with its third installment, “Dark of the Moon,” with $1.12 billion, a year in which Paramount led all studios with $1.95 billion grossed domestically with 19.2 percent market share.
Deadline first reported the news.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WWE Rumors: Current Champion Reportedly Set To Join Marvel Cinematic Universe</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Kieran Fisher
As The Inquisitr reported earlier, WWE superstar Becky Lynch is currently being mentored by John Cena and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson on how to make the transition from professional wrestling to Hollywood. “The Man” will appear on an upcoming episode of Billions, but she is reportedly also set to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe in an unconfirmed role.
As documented by Sportskeeda, Netflix’s Kris Tapley claims that the Raw Women’s Champion has been cast in a Marvel movie, but he didn’t reveal which one it is. If the rumor is true, however, this is a big move for the superstar as she seeks to ascend the Hollywood ladder.
The next movie on the Marvel release slate is Black Widow, which is a fitting project for “The Man” as it will feature an organization that’s made up of female assassins. Lynch’s prowess for combat courtesy of her wrestling experience, coupled with her popularity as one of the most famous athletes on the planet, makes her a perfect fit for a role such as this one.
According to MCU Cosmic, however, “The Man” could feature in Shang-Chi: Legend of the Ten Rings. The movie will reportedly feature a fighting tournament, which Lynch’s character could be a participant in. The report speculates that “The Man” will only have a cameo appearance in the upcoming film, and a tournament scene seems like an ideal way for her character to make a big impression despite the limited screen time.
However, the Marvel Cinematic Universe will also release The Eternals, as well as new Thor, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man and Blade films in the next couple of years. Lynch could appear in any one of them, or perhaps something else that hasn’t been announced yet.
Disney and Marvel own the rights to the Fantastic Four and X-Men franchises as well, and it’s only a matter of time before new movies enter production. At the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, Lynch even stopped by the Marvel booth to discuss her love of the X-Men franchise, revealing that she’s been a fan since her childhood. Perhaps the studio executives took notice.
Lynch’s acting career appears to be taking off in a big way, but she’s promised fans that she won’t be quitting WWE any time soon. According to “The Man,” she enjoys wrestling and being in front of a crowd too much to change careers full-time. However, now it appears as if she’s going to try and juggle both professions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Becky Lynch rumored to be joining Marvel Cinematic Universe</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was announced earlier this week that RAW Women's Champion Becky Lynch would be making an appearance on the upcoming season 5 premiere of the Showtime Series Billions this Sunday night.
Now, it appears The Man might be coming around to one of the most successful movie franchises in the history of cinema.
Netflix's Kris Tapley says that Becky Lynch has been cast in an upcoming Marvel movie, although he has not said which movie she will be appearing in.
There are numerous possibilities as the Marvel Cinematic Franchise is set to launch Phase 4 this fall with the release of Black Widow. Also, production is set to resume soon on Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, and according toJeremy Conrad (MCU Cosmic), that film is rumored to include a fighting tournament. Conrad speculates that she could appear as one of the tournament competitors.
There are also a number of other major Marvel projects coming up soon, including the next installments to the Thor, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man franchises.
As Becky Lynch has gotten more over with the fanbase, so has her mainstream marketability. Rumors are that Hollywood has started to take notice and this could just be the start of a gradual crossover for The Man.
It's quite possible that Becky Lynch will have the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of The Rock, John Cena, and Batista of pursuing a successful acting career after she hangs up her wrestling boots.
Becky Lynch, however, has not given any indication that she will be walking away from wrestling any time soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Avengers: Every Marvel superhero ranked</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s staggering to think that 10 years ago, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was yet to assemble any Avengers.
Now, 24 films later – and with the “epic conclusion” reached in Endgame, which is celebrating its first anniversary – the film series has introduced 27 world-saving characters.
After the introduction of the originals – including Iron Man, Captain America and Black Widow – it seemed unlikely that characters introduced in future films would rank alongside them.
It turns out that assumption was wildly incorrect – thanks to Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Panther and the MCU’s first female-led film Captain Marvel, starring Brie Larson, those originals have been given a run for their money.
Below, we rank every single Avenger (NB: we’ve omitted SHIELD agents Nick Fury, Phil Coulson and Maria Hill).
Scroll through the gallery to see our picks.
Avengers: Endgame is available to watch on NOW TV and Disney+.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Disney has started developing a live-action remake of its 1997 animated feature Hercules.
Anthony and Joe Russo of “Avengers: Endgame” fame will produce the project for the studio through their production house, AGBO.
Disney has hired Dave Callaham, the scribe of “The Expendables” and upcoming “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings”, to pen the script for the live-action remake, reported Variety.
The original film, directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, was inspired by the legendary hero Heracles, the son of Zeus, in Greek mythology.
In the movie, Hercules (voiced by Tate Donovan) is snatched as a baby by Hades and forced to live among mortals as a half-man, half-god.
Veteran actors Danny DeVito and James Wood had also voice starred in the movie.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Six Years After ‘Amazing Spider-Man 2’ Stumbled, Sony’s New Marvel Universe Gets A Terrible New Name</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Six years ago, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 underperformed and put a temporary end to Sony's hopes of an MCU-like Spidey franchise.
We got word yesterday that Sony has settled on a new name for their official universe/franchise/brand of Spider-Man and Spider-Man-related Marvel flicks. Following Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far from Home, both of which are technically part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Venom, Sony is on the brink of the very thing they sought six years ago on this day. They may just get their own Marvel cinematic universe, one which may or may not be loosely included in Disney DIS ’s current MCU. That’s the good news. The bad news is that the name is, frankly, kinda terrible. Instead of referring to this collection of movies as “the Spider-Verse” or maybe not giving it a name at all, the collection of Sony Spidey pictures will be called, uh, the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters.
But first, a history lesson...
Today, May 2, is the sixth anniversary of the release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2. The second of two Andrew Garfield/Marc Webb Peter Parker passion plays opened amid mixed reviews to a $93 million domestic launch, following a slow overseas roll-out beginning as early as April 17. The film’s reception is a complicated one. It crashed and burned in North America, earning just $202 million domestic compared to the $262 million cume of Amazing Spider-Man and the $336-$403 million cumes (sans inflation) of the previous Sam Raimi-directed trilogy. It performed slightly better than the previous Amazing Spider-Man movie overseas, earning $506 million compared to its 2012 predecessor’s $496 million cume. The $709 million global finish was considered a disappointment, both due to a $255 million budget and (more importantly) in terms of plans for a Sony-specific universe of Spider-Man movies and spin-offs.
While the movie itself was mostly stand-alone, save for a needless subplot involving Peter’s dead parents and a mid-credits tease for a potential Sinister Six movie down the road, the marketing and in-studio expectations set the film up as a backdoor pilot for a whole new world of Spider-Man heroes and Spider-Man villains. Moreover, the film pandered to the hardcore fan base by killing off its female lead (Emma Stone’s Gwen Stacey) which also removed both the new franchise’s most popular character and the new series’ most unique element (the romantic chemistry between Garfield and Stone). Alas, when the film was met with mediocre reviews and shockingly poor domestic legs, it meant that A) audiences were not jazzed for The Amazing Spider-Man 3 and B) audiences were certainly not jazzed for various spin-off movies (Venom, a young Aunt May spy flick, etc.).
Six years later, Sony seems to have discovered the gold at the end of the rainbow which they were pursuing with Marc Webb’s doomed Spider-Man reboot. Spider-Man: Homecoming, featuring Tom Holland as a young Peter Parker palling around with Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man and the rest of the MCU,earned solid reviews and $334 million domestic/$881 million worldwide on a $175 million budget, which is frankly what the Amazing Spider-Man movies should have cost. That’s one reason why Amazing Spider-Man 2 was a “flop” at $709 million but the $170 million-budgeted Captain America: The Winter Soldier was a “blockbuster” at $714 million in the same year. Spider-Man: Far From Home was sold as an epilogue to Avengers: Endgame and earned $390 million/$1.128 billion on a $165 million budget, passing Skyfall ($1.108 billion) as Sony’s biggest global grosser.
More importantly, Tom Hardy’s Venom overcame years of dismissal to score an $80 million domestic debut on its way to $214 million domestic, $279 million in China and $854 million worldwide on a mere $90 million budget. Jared Leto’s Morbius was supposed to open this July but will now debut in March of next year. Oh, and Sony’s animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse brought Miles Morales into the fold, earned rave reviews, earned $190 million domestic/$375 million worldwide (great for a superhero toon) and won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature over Pixar’s $1.2 billion-grossing Incredibles 2. A sequel has now been slated for October 23, 2022. Venom: Let There Be Carnage (starring Woody Harrelson as Carnage) will now open on June 25, 2021.
So the good news is that Sony may just get the “Spider-Man cinematic universe” they’ve been chasing for years. The bad news is that they’ve settled on an inexplicably terrible title for their franchise/brand. To be fair, a dumb name for a cinematic universe isn’t going to be a deal breaker if the movies work on a case-by-case basis. Shock of shocks, Reuben Fleischer’s Venom turned out to be an entirely stand-alone superhero origin story with only a standard mid-credit sequel tease, so it seems that Sony is learning the Iron Man lesson (happy 12th birthday to the first Iron Man, which opened May 2, 2008) of making stand-alone movies that work on their own terms. Nonetheless, why the hell they didn’t just call this the “Spider-Verse” is beyond me. That’s what we’ve all been calling it for the last year or two anyway.
It rolls off the tongue and it reminds folks of one of the best superhero movies ever made. The “Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters” feels like a name created by an algorithm meant to clog headlines and never be spoken by anyone outside of the industry or the media. I don’t think folks are going to be using “SPUMC” either. As Iron Man taught us 12 years ago, a ridiculous word salad (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) only works when it can be shortened to something snappy (S.H.I.E.L.D.). Yes, Into the Spider-Verse was a singular franchise and the Sony Marvel flicks won’t just be about Spider-Man, but heck, calling it “Sony Pictures’ Marvel Characters Universe” would at least get folks to (unofficially) call it “Sony’s MCU.” Which, especially if Michael Keaton’s Vulture is showing up in Morbius, is probably an accurate assessment.
This can only be an issue because Sony was successful in launching four well-received, commercially-successful and (save for Venom) well-reviewed Spider-Man or Spider-Man-ish comic book superhero flicks. The deal Disney and Sony reached in early 2015 allowed for a new Spider-Man series within the MCU, while also turning Andrew Garfield into the George Lazenby of the series. Yes, Holland is Roger Moore compared to Toby Maguire’s Sean Connery, and that’s not an insult to any of them. Even Venom shows that spin-offs can work. A really silly franchise name is A) mere trivia if the movies score and B) indicative of the kind of executive overthinking that turned Amazing Spider-Man from a cheap “Twilight with webs” into a $235 million “Spidey does Batman Begins” remake of Spider-Man and forced Amazing Spider-Man 2 to be a backdoor pilot for Sinister Six. Let’s hope I’m just overthinking it.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The world of ‘Hercules’ will come alive on the big screen once again, this time as a live-action film.
Disney is in early development of a live-action remake of its 1997 animated movie ‘Hercules’, with ‘Avengers’ filmmakers Joe and Anthony Russo producing through their AGBO production company, reports Variety.
Action specialist Dave Callaham is also on board to write the ‘Hercules’ script. Callaham is known for teaming up with Sylvester Stallone for the original screenplay for ‘The Expendables’, creating his character for the franchise.
The 1997 movie was a musical-fantasy retelling of the Hercules legend. It was directed by Ron Clements and John Musker.
The character of Hercules was voiced by Tate Donovan, who was snatched as a baby by Hades and forced to live among mortals as a half-man, half-god.
Hercules had to perform “a rite of passage” on Earth to prove himself worthy of living with the gods on Mount Olympus. He did it with the help of his mentor, voiced by Danny DeVito.
‘Hercules’ had an $85 million (Dh312.1 million) budget and generated $252 million at the worldwide box office. Other Disney films to get an updated live-action version include: ‘Beauty and the Beast’, ‘Aladdin’ and ‘The Lion King’.
The Russo brothers opened the AGBO facilities in Los Angeles last year and co-produced the Chris Hemsworth action film ‘Extraction’, out now on Netflix.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain's Got Talent: Fans have fallen in love with 96-year-old legend Nora</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain’s Got Talent fans have all fallen in love with 96-year-old Nora, who stormed her way to four yeses with a beautiful song accompanied by her daughter.
To be honest, what a legend.
Nora was joined on stage by her daughter Pam, who played along on the piano.
And to be say she was a revelation would be a bit of an understatement, with Nora gaining a new legion of fans up and down the nation.
To put it bluntly, we’re all now in love with her.
‘Go on Nora!’ One fan wrote. ’96-years-old and singing like that! What a woman.’
Another enamoured viewer added: ‘This is what it’s all about…go Nora!’
‘Can I adopt Nora?’ Another fan asked. And no, no you can’t, because she is a 96-year-old woman, sorry!
But the good news is is that Nora (and Pam!) stormed through to the next round, so we only have to wait to see what bop she’ll sing next time.
Maybe a bit of Ariana Grande if we’re lucky?
Tonight’s BGT also introduced us to mother and daughter duo Honey and Sammy, who only went and became Amanda Holden’s Golden Buzzer act.
Needless to say, everyone was in buckets of tears, as were we.
The only question remaining is…when will Nora drop her mixtape?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain’s Got Talent fans insist oldest ever contestant Nora Barton, 96, who has Alzheimer’s, needs to win</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRITAIN’S Got Talent has seen many worthy acts grace its stage but this series one woman has stood out amongst others – Nora Barton, the oldest ever contestant on the show.
And now viewers of the show want the glorious pensioner to win after her utterly charming performance.
Fans were bowled over tonight by 96-year-old Nora Barton, Britain's Got Talent's oldest ever contestant, who fulfilled her dream of performing at the London Palladium.
Nora, who has Alzheimer's, left the judges, audience and viewers blown away by her performance, and fans at home think she should win the show.
The 96-year-old already had viewers hooked when she quipped to host Ant McPartlin that she was doing “nowt” when he asked her what she was up to on stage.
Helped on stage by Ant, Nora’s daughter Pam Dimbleby, 65, who accompanied her, revealed it was a dream for her mother to play there.
The great-grandmother was dressed to impress in a red top, floral skirt and a flower in her hair, before she belted out The Loveliest Night Of The Year from 1951 film The Great Caruso, with daughter Pam playing along on piano.
The nonagenarian was left thrilled as she was given a standing ovation, with Nora saying “thank you very much!”
Fans at home were as equally enthused, taking to Twitter to write: “Nora.... Hands down winner for tonight’s show' declared one viewer.”
While a second added: “OMG! I think she's the winner! Such a lovely lady with a beautiful voice. We have Colin, now we need Nora. The Royal family would adore her. Smiling face with open mouthRed heart #BGT”
And a third concluded: “I've fallen for Nora on #BritainsGotTalent surely she is a winner! Her Royal Highness our Queen of England would love her”
All the judges fell in love with Nora tonight as David Walliams told her: “You are a very special lady because you are full of life, full of laughter, full of joy and you've just entertained the nation at 96.”
Before Alesha Dixon declared: “Once a show woman, always a show woman! I really enjoyed that whole performance, it was just completely charming! Congratulations Nora!”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain's Got Talent viewers moved by 96-year-old Nora's fantastic audition</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain's Got Talent fans were blown away by 96 year old Nora Barton on Saturday night's episode.
The charming singer is the show's oldest ever contestant, and arguably the most memorable of this year's hopefuls.
Nora, who came out on stage with her daughter Pam to play the piano, captured the hearts of the judges, audience and viewers at home with her wonderful singing voice.
She sang her own rendition of The Loveliest Night of the Year, which earned her a very well-deserved standing ovation from Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams.
Daughter Pam explained before the audition: "She's sung for people all her life."
As soon as Nora started singing, the crowds began to cheer.
"She's into it now, isn't she?" host Dec said from behind the scenes.
Judge Alesha was super impressed, telling Nora after her performance: "Once a show woman, always a show woman!
"I really enjoyed that whole performance. It was completely charming!"
David added: "You're a very special lady because you're full of life, full of laughter, full of joy. You've entertained the nation at 96."
While Amanda said: "It was a very special audition. You're a generation that this country is built on. Very well done, and thank you."
Simon joked that he didn't like the act, before proudly announcing: "I loved you!"
It goes without saying that viewers loved the audition, with many taking to Twitter to share their thoughts.
One wrote: "Right. I love Nora already."
"Aww Nora," another tweeted, "What an angel!"
A third exclaimed: "GIVE NORA THE GOLDEN BUZZER!"
A fourth gushed: "Wasn't emotionally prepared for Nora! #BGT."
While a fifth admitted: "GO ON NORA! 96 years old and singing like that, what a woman!"
A sixth viewer was moved to tears, writing: "How lovely was that on BGT. Nora and her daughter Pam. Brought tears to my eyes."
Britain's Got Talent continues next Saturday at 8pm on ITV and Virgin Media One.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Another Bachelor baby is on the way!
Original The Bachelor Australia couple Tim Robards and Anna Heinrich have announced they’re having a baby.
The pair both took to social media on Saturday to share the exciting news with fans.
“It’s been so hard to keep this a secret, over the past few months, but I can now finally shout… I’M PREGNANT!!!” Heinrich wrote alongside a collage of adorable photos.
“With everything that’s going on in the world we feel incredibly lucky and grateful to be starting a family together, and we’re so looking forward to this next chapter in our lives.”
Tim also revealed his excitement to become a father.
“We’ve been keeping busy in lockdown,” The Neighbours TV star joked.
“I can’t wait to be a Dad!!! The giddy feelings in my stomach show there must be a few nerves, but I know Anna’s going to be an absolutely amazing mother and I couldn’t be more excited to start a family with her!”
The couple met on the first season of The Bachelor Australia  in 2013, and tied the knot in a magical ceremony in Italy in 2018.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HA:TFELT revealed she's writing a wedding song for Wonder Girls' Lim.Lim and her longtime boyfriend Shin Min Chulannounced they would be tying the knot this summer, and her fellow Wonder Girls' member HA:TFELT wanted to congratulate her with a song. At her online book talk show 'Zoom In' on May 1, HA:TFELT expressed, "Actually, they asked if I would sing at their wedding. I want to write a new song and perform something original, so I'm deep in thought these days."On her new album '1719', HA:TFELT chose her favorite song, choosing "3 Minutes". She said, "I didn't think it would get a lot of love. It's a style I really like, and I think I sound pretty good in it, so that's why I hold a lot of affection for it." HA:TFELT also gave advice to fans, explaining, "I don't think there's one set answer for everyone. Some people can overcome things without much thought, while others prefer to really think things through before coming to a resolution. In my case, I sort through things by writing and making music. What's most important is that everything comes to an end eventually. Even if difficult times feel so long, they will pass, so I think it's good to have the thought, 'This too shall pass,' in your mind." In other news, HAT:FELT recently released the music video for "Life Sucks".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello Joke About Making ‘Organic Slime’ After Winning Kids’ Choice Award</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Shawn Mendes, 21, and Camila Cabello, 23, just won big at the Kids’ Choice Awards! The couple and “Senorita” collaborators nabbed Favorite Music Collaboration blimp on the broadcast for the song, and thanked their fans with a sweet message. “What’s up guys! Thank you so much for the Kids’ Choice Award, we love you so much,” Shawn began in the selfie-filmed video from their home in Miami, Florida. “This is so cool. I literally watched the Kids’ Choice Awards for forever and we wish we were there to get slimed,” Camila added.
“We wish that we could be there with you, but we hope that everybody is staying safe,” Shawn added, as Camila couldn’t resist bringing up the one thing the KCAs are known for: slime! “We love you, thank you so much for voting. We’re going to make organic slime and slime ourselves,” she joked! We’ll be keeping an eye on their social accounts if that indeed does happen. The couple looked cozy and casual at home, as Camila rocked a white, blue, and red t-shirt along with a ’90s-inspired pair of black overalls! For his part, Shawn rocked an open olive-green button down shirt and black t-shirt. The pair rocked the same outfits in their videos a day earlier promoting the All-In challenge.
“Congrats, you two are the cutest!” host Victoria Justice gushed, as she revealed Shawn had earned a second award for Favorite Male Artist! “Thank you so much for choosing me, your Favorite Male Artist everybody. I just want to say I love you guys and I miss you so much,” Shawn said in a second video, filmed outdoors. “Not a day goes by where I don’t think of you guys, and remember how incredible my fans are. I can’t wait to perform with all of you and sing with you again,” the Canadian singer added.
The couple joined the broadcast, which was hosted by Victorious star Victoria Justice, from Camila’s parents home in Miami, Florida where they have been in quarantine since March. Shawn and Camila are seen going for casual walks almost daily in the area, with Shawn hilariously enjoying his coffee in a ceramic mug (we’re guessing he can’t get his Canadian fave Tim Horton’s down in Florida!).
Shawn and Camila have been slaying it with their virtual performances all month long, and delivered an incredible cover of Louis Armstrong’s “It’s A Wonderful World” on the One World: Together At Home special on April 18. The song was the perfect choice to show support to the hardworking healthcare workers and those working on the frontlines during the pandemic. Shawn accompanied his leading lady on piano as they sung together, showing off their incredible vocals.
The Kids Choice Awards was originally scheduled to air on Mar. 22, however, was postponed amidst the Coronavirus pandemic. Nickelodeon announced the virtual version, Nickelodeon’s Kids’ Choice Awards 2020: Celebrate Together, which also served to donate an incredible $1 million donation to No Kid Hungry.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES - The legal drama “All Rise” has become the first U.S. scripted television series to adapt the the pandemic by producing an episode remotely, enlisting its stars to work from home on their own makeup, set design and lighting.
The season finale, airing Monday night on CBS, finds Simone Missick’s Judge Lola Carmichael presiding over a Los Angeles Superior Court bench trial via video conference.
Missick said she was exhausted at the end of each shooting day after making her own adjustments to costume and sound, converting her living room into an office and her dining room into a court room.
“I did pick up new skills. I think that I could be a location scout-slash-set design co-ordinator. I don’t need to lead the department, but I could be in the background,” Missick laughed in a Zoom interview. “So if this acting stuff doesn’t work out, I could maybe pick up a career doing it virtually because that was the fun part.”
While most full-season shows cut production short due to stay-home orders, “All Rise” creator Greg Spottiswood said he realized that the dialogue-heavy nature of his show allowed for remote production. A key challenge — predicting how the legal world would adjust to the novel coronavirus, with prisons becoming outbreak hotspots and video chats replacing in-court hearings.
“The justice system needs to find a way to respond to this moment. Technology is one of the ways that they’re responding to it,” he said.
Spottiswood said producers paid the full crew, even those that weren’t able to work, for the episode. While the show could produce more episodes remotely in a second season if necessary, he’s anxious to get back to sets and real-world locations.
Missick said her mother-in-law in Atlanta had been hospitalized with COVID-19 for eight days, with symptoms serious enough to require a ventilator. She had fully recovered by the time Missick began shooting, but it brought the coronavirus crisis close to home for the 38-year-old actress.
In her downtime after production, Missick has enjoyed Hulu’s “Little Fires Everywhere” and the Netflix series “Unorthodox.” But she’s been struck by how far away from today’s reality the action on the screen can feel.
“Everything is BC. It’s ‘before coronavirus.’ You’re watching people — they’re in restaurants, they’re hugging each other. You’re like, ‘God, I remember what that was like.’ Now, I think every show that comes after is going to have to deal with what this pandemic is.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain’s Got Talent 2020 viewers were left sharing their disbelief over one hopeful's age on Saturday night, as she took to the stage with her young daughter.
Singing duo Honey and Sammy wowed the judges and fans with their moving rendition of Freya Ridings’ Lost Without You.
They went on to win Amanda Holden’s Golden Buzzer in emotional scenes, with the judge in tears.
But before they’d even started singing, viewers watching at home were stunned over something mum Sammy said.
Asked by Simon Cowell for her age, after confirming her daughter was 14, Sammy revealed that she was 43 years old.
Stunning Sammy’s youthful looks left viewers in shock though, with many believing she was much younger.
Taking to twitter, they couldn't believe her real age and some even thought the girls were sisters.
One fan commented: "Bloody hell is that really her mum."
Another said: "43? she looks fantastic #BGT #BritainsGotTalent."
A third tweeted: "Omg they look like sisters!!"
The pair were stopped mid performance by Simon Cowell, with him asking for a different song.
A little later the mother and daughter returned, and left the judges speechless with their audition.
Amanda was moved to tears and praised the pair, before hitting her Golden Buzzer.
Sammy and Honey burst into tears, as Amanda joined them on stage.
Britain's Got Talent continues Saturdays at 8pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain's Got Talent: Fans 'crying' as Honey and Sammy get Golden Buzzer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain’s Got Talent fans are feeling very emotional tonight as mother and daughter duo Honey and Sammy were chosen as Amanda Holden’s Golden Buzzer act.
They stunned audiences with their performance of Lost Without You by Freya Ridings, after previously being asked to return with a second song after an unsuccessful performance of a song from the musical Waitress.
To make it even more emotional, Honey said they were entering the competition as a testament to their bond as Sammy recovered from cancer treatment.
‘In the past couple of years my mum got diagnosed with cancer,’ Honey began. ‘It has been a tough couple of years and to be here with my mum is the best thing that has happened to me.
After their performance had the entire audience onto their feet, Amanda pressed her Golden Buzzer and sent Honey and Sammy straight through the live semi-finals.
And its fair to say that viewers are now crying just like us.
‘Golden Buzzer! Yes! Amazing!’ One fan wrote. ‘They deserve that moment. Crying at this!’
Another teary fan added: ‘Every time someone pressed that golden buzzer I end up crying!’
Same, hun, same.
‘I’m trying not to cry,’ a viewer admitted .’I’m not crying. Not crying!’
Don’t worry babes, we’re all with you, do you want a tissue?
Honey and Sammy now join the other Golden Buzzer acts to go through this series, including 12-year-old music prodigy Fayth Ifil.
Britain Got Talent airs Saturdays at 8pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain's Got Talent fans divided over Amanda's Golden Buzzer act</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans of Britain's Got Talent have accused the show of being a 'set up' after a mum and daughter duo won Amanda's heart.
14-year-old Honey and her mum arrived on stage and Honey confessed she had signed them up for the talent show.
She then told how her mum had been diagnosed with cancer and after a rough couple of years, things were finally looking up for them.

They began by singing a song from the musical Waitress, but Simon stopped them midway through.
He told them he didn't like the song and he wanted them to go away and learn another then come back later in the day.
The duo exited the stage, and then came back just 15 minutes later to perform again.
Even Simon was shocked they had returned so soon, saying he was expecting them later in the show.
Mum Sammy admitted she had the lyrics on her hands before they belted out Freya Ridings' Lost Without You.
The judges all thought they were amazing, Simon told them he would remember their audition for a really long time.
Amanda was so moved she decided to push her Golden Buzzer.
Simon told her: "They really deserved that."
But viewers at home were far from convinced.
They accused the whole thing of being a set up.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Smitten Kate Middleton has been filmed cooing on camera as she virtually met a newborn baby and his parents.
The Duchess Of Cambridge was introduced to the tot during a video call ahead of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week.
As she said hello to the proud mum and dad, Kate giggled and said: "It's nice to meet you. This is definitely a first I think!"
Kate, 38, was then introduced to their little bundle. Cooing, she gasped: "He is so sweet. Ah, congratulations."
The tot's tired mum revealed she had only given birth to her son the night before.
"My goodness. You must be exhausted," Kate sympathised.

In the footage, which has been posted on Kensington Palace's social media accounts, Kate also meets a range of staff from the midwifery sector.
Mum-of-three Kate tells them: "As organisations, you are playing such a vital role.
"Giving key information, you are hugely trusted by the public. Therefore, the information you provide is a lifeline to a lot of people at this time."
One of the medics explains to Kate that it is important to "get the message out about mental health".
He then urges new parents: "If you need help, get help."
Kate also spoke to midwives about the impact that the coronavirus pandemic is having on them.
She asked them how they were, saying: "There's stress and anxieties out there for families anyway, but you're still working and there's extra pressure and worry.
"And also trying to wear very uncomfortable kit as well.
Kate added: "Babies come all the time, so the fact you have to work in these difficult times...well done."
Both Kate and her husband, Prince William, work tirelessly to promote mental health awareness.
Her latest efforts have been applauded by their fans.
One tweeted: "The baby is cute. keep up the good work duchess Kate, mental health is really important."

A third remarked: "Love her, she’s going to be a brilliant Queen one day."
Meanwhile, it was celebrations all round in Kate and William's household on Saturday (May 2, 2020).
The couple's middle child, Princess Charlotte, turned five. Kate and William shared a beautiful photo of their daughter to mark the special occasion.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kate Middleton coos over newborn during surprise virtual maternity ward visit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A newborn received a royal welcome when the Duchess of Cambridge paid a virtual ­visit over the internet.
Kate, who has a keen ­interest in early years development, spoke to parents Rebecca Atwood and John Gill about what it was like to have a baby during the lockdown.
The Duchess, 38, cooed at baby Max, who was just 16 hours old, and said: “Hello! Very nice to meet you! This is ­definitely a first, I think!”
After sending “huge congratulations” to his parents, Kate added: “He is so sweet. When did you have him?”
When told he had arrived at 10pm the previous night, she replied: “My goodness, you must be exhausted!"
Kate’s surprise ‘bedside visit’ came during a call to staff at Kingston Hospital’s Maternity Unit on April 22.
She did a two-day work placement at the south west London hospital last November, and this time heard from staff about their experiences during the pandemic.
Six midwives took it in turns to join the chat, while one pulled on personal protective equipment and took a ­laptop to introduce mum-of-three Kate to baby Max and his parents.
The Duchess dialled in from Anmer Hall in Norfolk – where the Cambridges have been staying during the lockdown – and heard that the hospital had dealt with a rise in referrals for anxiety.
Jo Doumouchtsi, perinatal mental health midwife, said: “The main issues women are having are around coming into hospital and catching Covid, but also about the isolation after the baby is born.
“They have to self-isolate, so they are having limited support from their other family members.”
And midwife Jennifer Tshibamba added: “We want women to know we’re here, we’re still open.
“Even with what’s ­going on, we’re here to listen to you, we’re still here to make sure we provide you with the best care for your pregnancy, for your baby and support your family.”
The hospital’s perinatal mental health team – which includes psychiatrists and mental health nurses – sends out a weekly newsletter that gives mums advice for coping during the pandemic and lists what ­services are available.
Kate said: “That’s probably such a valuable tool for them now. To you all there, you do an amazing job, ­honestly, as you say, ­babies come all the time.
“The fact you’re having to work in these difficult times… well done.”
Kate told the midwives how she and husband William had spoken to NHS staff about the importance of reaching out if they were feeling low.
She said: “They don’t feel they can reach out because they feel guilty for doing it, which is extraordinary.
“With new mums and parents and families, they don’t want to feel like they’re overburdening but it is so ­important to reach out and ask for help when you do need it.”
As part of their work to support people during the pandemic, the Duke and Duchess have created a new text service dedicated to key workers.
Leading mental health charities will work together to provide 24-hour ­support to those under pressure while millions of us stay at home to save lives.
Mind, Samaritans, Shout, Hospice UK and the Cambridges’ Royal Foundation will provide support and online resources to the key workers keeping Britain ­moving through the crisis.
William, 37, said the text service would be their “top priority” in the coming months. And ahead of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week – which starts tomorrow – Kate said new mums should also speak up if they need help.
Typically, around one in 10 women experience a mental illness during ­pregnancy or in the first year after giving birth.
Kate said that in her experience, talking to other mums helped.
She said: “You realise you are going through the same thing. Before that, you’re worried that actually, what you’re experiencing, you’re the only one going through it.
“To be able to share it in whatever way, whether it’s on the phone, through social media – in any form – ­it does ­normalise some of these anxieties.”
Using a video call to ­connect with others was exactly what Princess Charlotte did on her fifth birthday on Saturday.
Kate and William threw a party for their daughter at home, with lots of fun and games for her and brothers, George, six and Louis, two.
A source said Charlotte also made Zoom calls to members of her family, ­including the Queen.
Kensington Palace ­yesterday released five photos of the ­princess to mark her birthday – all of which were taken by mum Kate.
The sweet images showed a smiling Charlotte helping to deliver care packages to vulnerable Norfolk residents during the lockdown.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How we stay together: 'I don’t want to just be flatmates. It’s got to be more than that'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Names: Julia and Paul Miller Years together: 29Occupations: Therapist and engineer
Hearing her future husband sing The Sound of Music’s My Favourite Things sealed the deal for Julia Miller.
The couple were finalising their wedding preparations, a stressful time made worse because Julia’s father was in the final stages of cancer. She was steeling herself for the inevitable, when late one night she got a prank call. After telling the random caller exactly what she thought of him, she was upset and couldn’t get back to sleep. And so Paul sang his favourite song, about whiskers on kittens and raindrops on roses, to soothe her. “That’s the moment that I knew he was the one for me,” she says now.
The Sydney couple will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary in November. Yet when they first met, the then-21-year-old Julia wasn’t interested in Paul, who was 23.
She’d just come out of a bad relationship and wasn’t looking for anything serious. A mutual friend decided she needed a fling to cheer her up, so she set the couple up, organising a group date on a yacht. Reluctantly Julia went along.
But Paul was keen: “I thought she was hot when I saw her. I was interested right from the first second.” He was an experienced sailor so he hoped to impress her, even feigning a dangerous moment that he skilfully navigated. Julia remained oblivious. Undeterred, the mutual friend nudged them into a second date. And this time, when just the two of them went to the movies, it was more successful. “That’s when I thought ‘I like what he looked like, but actually I really like him. He’s a nice guy.’”
At the time Paul was living in Newcastle and Julia was in Sydney, but they spent as much time together as they could. They bonded over their similar upbringings and shared values and quickly realised they were right for each other. After six months they moved in together in Sydney. They were keen to get engaged too, but were conscious that others may think they were rushing. “I’ve still got the piece of paper where Paul wrote the plan of when we were going to get engaged, because he’s like that,” says Julia. Paul adds their courtship was “pretty quick” by “2020 standards”… “but I think in the late 80s it wasn’t probably too ridiculous.”
The lead-up to the wedding was stressful. Not only was Julia’s father battling cancer, their priest was unwell with a brain tumour and a close family member died suddenly. Then three days before the wedding, Julia went to pick up her dress only to find her dressmaker was ill and not even close to finishing it, or the bridesmaid dresses. In a mad dash, Julia roped every woman she knew to finish the dresses in time for the wedding day. “I got an ulcer. I definitely got cold sores the day before. But I lost a lot of weight so I was really skinny,” she says with a laugh.
The day itself went smoothly but all the stress taught the couple an important lesson. Julia says they learned “early in the piece how we would go through bad times together.”
Young, happy and in love, the first few years of their marriage was fun. They saved hard and travelled. About four years into their marriage, they had their first daughter. Things got trickier around the arrival of their second child. “When you have just one child it doesn’t affect you so much, but when you have a second one and each of you have to share the load a little bit more, it probably separates you a little bit more than you’re first used to,” remembers Paul.
They made an effort to spend as much time together as possible. It was something Julia had learnt from her own parents. “They’re the sort of people who had to make sure that they had time to themselves so to a certain extent they pushed the kids away,” says Paul. “A lot of that rubbed off on Julia, so she made sure that our kids didn’t get in between us. So I think that’s been a positive in our relationship.”
They were always careful to maintain affection. “My mum and dad were really, really affectionate,” says Julia. “I think when I first met Paul he was affectionate, but he wouldn’t kiss me in public. It took him a little while, and now I find he’s probably worse than me,” she laughs.
Both were determined to make it work. Julia in particular wanted a great marriage, not just a mediocre one. “I thought, ‘I don’t want to just be together because of the kids,’ or, ‘I don’t want to just be flatmates.’ It’s got to be more than that.” She says if it had come to it, she wouldn’t have stuck around. “It’s just too sad. It’s too sad to be living in a loveless marriage.”
One of their biggest challenges came when Paul became very involved with sailing, spending huge amounts of time on it, to the exclusion of everything else. Julia made it clear things had to change. “That was probably our biggest hurdle, that was a couple of years and the girls were young-ish. But I remember one of my daughters saying, ‘All you do is argue’ … I just could not get him to understand how I felt about it.”
It’s something that Paul recognises in himself: “One of my problems is that I focus too much and I have blinkers. I can’t see everything else going on in my life, but that’s where we’re a good couple together because we are very good at adapting ... I don’t think either of us are really stubborn, so we tend to be able to adapt to either bring the other back onto the right path or to, when required, stay calm and live with it.”
What saved them was renovating their house, working shoulder to shoulder each weekend. It was another important lesson for the couple. “You’ve got to have projects together,” says Paul.
Over the years, their approach to conflict has evolved. Where Paul usually avoids conflict, Julia prefers to deal with it straight away. “He now is starting to say, ‘I’m sorry, I didn’t realise that I was hurting you. Do you need to discuss it?’” And a lot of the time I go, ‘No, I’m fine. Because you validated it.’”
They were never afraid to disagree in front of their two girls. Both had grown up in homes where their parents didn’t appear to argue, so when there was an argument, it would cause undue anxiety. Instead they wanted their children to see them disagree, resolve and move on.
There was something else. For Julia, as a girl growing up surrounded by brothers, she had to learn to speak up for herself. She wanted her girls to learn that too. “I needed my girls to feel they could have a voice. My daughters will still say, ‘Good on you, Mum’s standing up to Dad.’ Not that Dad’s a pushover, but it’s to say, ‘Don’t let a man dominate you.’ For me that was important for the girls to see, that you can say what you think and not have to be pleasing all the time.”
These days both daughters are adults and have moved out of home. Julia and Paul are enjoying their time together, not least because they still have much in common. “We’ve got friends who go, ‘Oh, I love the way you do things together,’ I think, ‘Yeah, because we’ve kind of kept at it,’” says Julia.
“Not so long ago, [Paul] said, ‘I don’t think I’ll leave you. I’m kind of used to you now,’” says Julia. “I’ve told people that and they’ve gone, ‘Oh,’ and I thought, ‘No, it makes me laugh because that’s how I feel.’” She says they’ve settled into a more comfortable rhythm than ever before. “I never wanted to leave but you’re trying to make this perfect relationship … the kids have to be this and we have to have this perfect family. And now it’s just like, ‘Oh, I’m kind of used to you now’ … It’s not because you couldn’t find anyone else... It’s just that this life is easy.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amanda Holden was left in tears after a mother and daughter performed together on Britain’s Got Talent.
Honey and Sammy from Essex will perform on tonight’s BGT where they will sing Lost Without You by Freya Ridings.
In a rather emotional first-look clip, the duo take to the stage where Honey explained to the judges their backstory of why they are auditioning.
‘In the past couple of years my mum got diagnosed with cancer,’ the 14-year-old began.
‘It has been a tough couple of years and to be here with my mum is the best thing that has happened to me.
‘I never thought when me and my mum would be singing in the car that it would bring us to this stage.’
The pair got amazing feedback from the judges, and it left Amanda reaching for the tissues.
‘After everything you have been through, you deserve that moment,’ Simon said.
‘I am going to remember this audition for a long long time.’
Amanda added: ‘Every single lyric that you got right and sang just seemed so poignant to your story it was the most wonderful thing to witness.’
Other acts that wow the judges on tonight’s instalment are 96-year-old Nora and a group of dancing turtles.
Yes you heard that right!
Britain’s Got Talent continues on Saturday at 8pm on ITV.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Treva Bowdoin
Demi revealed that she just learned how to use her self-timer.
Demi Lovato upped her selfie game by learning to use the self-timer feature on her phone, and her fans were the beneficiaries of her newfound knowledge when she snapped a steamy swimsuit snapshot.
On Saturday, Demi took to Instagram to share a set of two photos with her 80.9 million followers. For her intimate solo photo shoot, the 27-year-old singer rocked a strapless bathing suit that was a rich wine color. The garment featured all-over ruching, a design element that elevated its appearance by giving it texture and depth. The folds of gathered fabric also added a touch of elegance to Demi’s figure-flattering swimwear, while a sweetheart neckline gave it a romantic feel.
In Demi’s first photo, all of her bathing suit was submerged in the crystal-clear water of a a hot tub. However, the “Sorry Not Sorry” singer was providing a close look at the tantalizing amount of cleavage that the garment’s low neckline was leaving exposed. In this picture, Demi was reaching out to take the selfie by holding the camera away from her.
Her pale freckled skin looked radiant. Her cheeks were slightly flushed, and her lips were a natural shade of pink. If Demi was wearing any eye makeup at all, it was subtle. However, her dark eyelashes did appear to be curled.
Demi’s second photo was taken from a distance. She was standing up so that the bubbling water in the stone hot tub came up to her hips, which provided a peek at the top of her curvy derriere. She had her back arched, and she was reaching up with both hands to grasp her long, dark hair. The musician had her lips slightly parted, and she was gazing at the camera with a dreamy look on her face.
In the caption of her post, Demi seemingly suggested that she won’t need the help of celebrity photographer Angelo Kritikos as much now that she’s mastered the art of taking timed photos.
It took just one hour for Demi’s demonstration of her photography skills to earn her over 1.1 million likes. Her natural beauty look proved to be a big hit with her followers.
“You look so amazing without your makeup Demi,” read one response to her photos.
“You are so naturally beautiful!” another admirer remarked.
However, one fan was impressed with an area of Demi’s body other than her flawless face.
“How do you get your armpits to look so good?” the commenter asked.
Earlier this year, Demi shared another gorgeous selfie that received rave reviews from her fans. She was completely barefaced, and she let her Instagram followers know that she was “proud” of her freckles and her “booty chin.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Selena Gomez, 27, is still making music! The pop star shared a gorgeous make-up free photo to her Instagram on Saturday, May 2 as she appeared to be preparing to record a song. “Makeshift studio so I can work from home,” she captioned the post for her 175 million followers, adding headphone, music sheet and microphone emojis. Selena’s complexion absolutely glowed in the photo, which showed her sitting on the ground and looking back at the camera with her right hand resting on her chin. She kept her dark hair loose and down for the at-home recording session, kicking off her fur slippers to go barefoot.
We were loving Selena’s cozy quarantine style as she opted for a gray knit sweater and a casual black sweatpants. She looked relaxed and ready-to-go with her sticker-covered notebook on the ground to the left, and various recording equipment — including a music stand and a mic — surrounded by temporary gray studio walls. The Texas native recently dished about building the at-home studio space, and it looks like it came along swimmingly! “Currently, I’m actually building this little studio situation. I’m doing it with people that have been in my house,” she revealed to Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in an interview released on April 27. “I’m creating a little station where I’m going to be able to FaceTime with my engineer and some of my producer friends, and we’re going to try and make some music. I haven’t started that process, but that’s what we’re doing right now. I was going to FaceTime some of my writing friends, and just see what we’re all feeling during this time,” she said.
The Wizards of Waverly Place alum also opened up about how she’s been spending her time in quarantine. “I do find that routine and structure helps…I’ll go into a little bit of like two days watching a lot of stuff, and then I’ll realize I definitely need to like do something,” she said on the interview, conducted over FaceTime. “I do a lot of walks. I do weights inside of the house. I embarrassingly watch the YouTube videos where I’m trying to do what the woman is telling me to do, but she looks so glamorous doing it,” she added.
Despite being at-home, Selena has plenty on-the-go with the upcoming launch of her highly anticipated makeup line Rare Beauty! “Being rare is about being comfortable in yourself,” Selena narrates in a trailer promoting the line, which drops in “summer 2020” at Sephora according to the website. “I want us all to stop comparing ourselves to each other and embracing our uniqueness. You aren’t defined by a photo, a like or a comment,” she also shares in the uplifting video.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mother and daughter team, Sammy and Honey, gave an emotional and golden buzzer worthy performance on “Britain’s Got Talent”.
As the duo took the stage, Honey, 14, revealed why they decided to compete.
“In the past couple of years my mom got diagnosed with cancer,” Honey said. “It has been a tough couple of years and to be here with my mom is the best thing that has happened to me. I never thought when me and my mom would be singing in the car that it would bring us to this stage.”
Yet, there first go wasn’t a success with judge Simon Cowell stopping them.
“I just don’t like the song but your voices work really well together, how would you feel about coming back later on today?” he asked.
And thank goodness they did because their second attempt where they sang “Lost Without You” by Freya Ridings landed them the golden buzzer from fellow judge Amanda Holden.
Alesha Dixon told the duo, “I just loved the connection, there’s nothing more beautiful than a mother, daughter relationship.”
Holden added, “Every single lyric that you got right and sang just seemed so poignant to your story it was the most wonderful thing to witness.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain's Got Talent: Mum and daughter become Amanda Holden's golden buzzer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A mother and daughter act has become Britain’s Got Talent’s fourth golden buzzer act of the series.
Honey and Sammy from Essex wowed the entire audience with their heartfelt performance of Lost Without You by Freya Ridings.
And Amanda Holden was so impressed she gave them her one and only golden buzzer.
It was a truly emotional moment.
The first time the pair went on stage, the 14-year-old explained to the judges why they were there.
‘In the past couple of years my mum got diagnosed with cancer,’ Honey began.
‘It has been a tough couple of years and to be here with my mum is the best thing that has happened to me.
‘I never thought when me and my mum would be singing in the car that it would bring us to this stage.’
Although their audition didn’t go too well as Simon Cowell stopped them half-way through the song.
‘I just don’t like the song but your voices work really well together, how would you feel about coming back later on today?’ he asked them.
When Honey and Sammy came on stage later on that day, they came back with a vengeance .
The pair got amazing feedback from the judges, and it left Amanda reaching for the tissues.
‘After everything you have been through, you deserve that moment,’ Simon said.
‘I am going to remember this audition for a long long time.’
Alesha Dixon commented: ‘I just loved the connection, there’s nothing more beautiful than a mother, daughter relationship.’
Amanda added: ‘Every single lyric that you got right and sang just seemed so poignant to your story it was the most wonderful thing to witness.’
Other acts that audition for the judges on tonight’s instalment are 96-year-old Nora and a group of dancing turtles.
Britain’s Got Talent continues on Saturday at 8pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BGT fans in tears as Simon Cowell halts mum and girl's audition</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain's Got Talent viewers were in tears after Simon Cowell halted a mum and daughter's performance.
Honey and Sammy, aged 14 and 43 from Essex, pulled at the heartstrings as they opened up about their life.
The teenager revealed she came on the show with her mum, she said: "In the last two years my mum got diagnosed with cancer, and it's been like a tough couple of years and to be here with my mum is the best things that's ever happened to me.
"I'm just so grateful for everything that's happening, I never thought when me and my mum were singing in the car we'd ever come on a stage."
But as they started singing, Simon halted their performance.
He explained that whilst they sounded good together, the song wasn't working for them.
Simon asked them to go backstage, learn another song and then come back.
Luckily, on their second attempt, singing Freya Riding's Lost Without You, they stole the show with their vocals.
They received four 'yes' votes and Amanda Holden gave the pair her golden buzzer.
Viewers were in tears over the whole situation.
Matt tweeted: "Well there I go again the # floodgatesof my tears overtook me again, that was beautiful just beautiful mum and daughter singing on # BGT."
Leanne said: "In tears over @ BGTalready, LOVED the Mother and Daughter melted me."
And Graham said: "Amanda Holden’s golden buzzer act has me in tears. What a beautiful mother and daughter. Beautiful song choice and beautiful voices."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pandemic-era celebrities struggle to strike appropriate tone</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK — As the coronavirus pandemic has forced populations worldwide indoors, many celebrities have harnessed their star power to try and raise spirits online, dubbing the illness a great unifier.
But expressions of solidarity have rung hollow for some social media users fatigued by content that's perhaps well-intentioned but backdropped by hot tubs, crackling fireplaces, or backyard pools.
The most recent eye rolls came after the announcement that some 200 celebrities and politicians -- including billionaire Oprah, superstar actress Julia Roberts and former U.S. President George W Bush -- would participate in a 24-hour long "Call to Unite" livestream event over the weekend to encourage donating to COVID-19 relief efforts.
"If only they knew ppl with money," tweeted journalist Astead Herndon of the announcement.
And yet, we watch: more than 270 million people worldwide tuned in to a recent star-studded marathon special intended to celebrate essential workers that featured headliners the Rolling Stones and Taylor Swift performing from their homes.
Even for those loving to hate, the streamed sing-alongs and Instagram live soliloquies keep the internet rapt, perhaps temporarily alleviating the boredom of life indoors.
Whether messages of the rich and famous fascinate or leave a bad taste, that attention remains "says more about our culture than these actual celebrities," according to professor Cheryl Thompson of Toronto's Ryerson University.
"We might not want to admit it to ourselves," Thompson told AFP, but "we look to them, in some ways, to be our gauge for what we should think and feel."
The scholar of creative industries pointed to Tom Hanks' announcement in mid-March that he had contracted coronavirus, saying that news convinced many people the infection was serious.
Indeed, Jenna Anderson said the realities of the coronavirus first hit her once Hanks -- whom she called a "national-treasure type" -- went public with his illness.
The 30-year-old previously living in Australia, where Hanks quarantined, is now isolating with her family in Houston.
But Anderson said while some content has been useful -- stars' descriptions of symptoms, for example -- "most of what sticks in my mind are negative experiences where celebrities do seem a bit out of touch."
The internet slammed talkshow personality Ellen DeGeneres when she joked self-quarantine in her glassy California mansion was like "being in jail."
Arnold Schwarzenegger criticized spring-breakers from his jacuzzi, cigar in hand, while a coterie of stars led by Gal Gadot became a laughingstock after dropping an awkward cover of John Lennon's "Imagine," including Zoe Kravitz perched by her fireplace while others appeared to be meandering across their estates.
Many stars "seem to really try to keep in the forefront of people's minds in a way that seems unnecessary to me, based on what I assume about how much money they have and how successful they are," Anderson said.
Still, Thompson said "we've always had this sense that celebrities come and take us away from the hard times."
During World War II, for example, the U.S. government called Hollywood stars to visit troops or promote war bond sales.
Many celebrities today have deployed their wealth, including entertainment mogul Rihanna's donation of medical equipment to New York state and $5 million to several relief organizations, or Beyonce's $6 million donation to nonprofits.
Country icon Dolly Parton meanwhile is financing Vanderbilt University research efforts for a vaccine.
Beyond the cash, entertainment can soothe -- and Thompson predicted the trauma of the current moment could fuel more intriguing art in years to come.
"The struggle has always brought with it amazing creative outputs," she said.
Until then there is plenty of celebrity content relying less on platitudes, and more on entertaining the masses by leaning into the absurd.
Britney Spears has been offering eyebrow-raising comic relief including an abrupt tale of the time she "burned down her gym" -- no one was harmed -- while "Mad Men" star January Jones has taken on the role of quarantine eccentric, offering a recipe for a "human stew" detox bath.
And "Jurassic Park" actor Sam Neill has been posting playful albeit slightly unhinged videos -- including a bit where he voices a garden gnome who schools listeners on self-isolation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pandemic-era celebrities struggle to strike appropriate tone</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK, USA – As the coronavirus pandemic has forced populations worldwide indoors, many celebrities have harnessed their star power to try and raise spirits online, dubbing the illness a great unifier.
But expressions of solidarity have rung hollow for some social media users fatigued by content that's perhaps well-intentioned but backdropped by hot tubs, crackling fireplaces, or backyard pools.
The most recent eye rolls came after the announcement that some 200 celebrities and politicians – including billionaire Oprah, superstar actress Julia Roberts and former US president George W. Bush – would participate in a 24-hour long "Call to Unite" livestream event starting Friday, May 1, to encourage donating to COVID-19 relief efforts.
"If only they knew ppl with money," tweeted journalist Astead Herndon of the announcement.
And yet, we watch: more than 270 million people worldwide tuned in to a recent star-studded marathon special intended to celebrate essential workers that featured headliners The Rolling Stones and Taylor Swift performing from their homes.
Even for those loving to hate, the streamed sing-alongs and Instagram live soliloquys keep the internet rapt, perhaps temporarily alleviating the boredom of life indoors.
Whether messages of the rich and famous fascinate or leave a bad taste, that attention remains "says more about our culture than these actual celebrities," according to professor Cheryl Thompson of Toronto's Ryerson University.
"We might not want to admit it to ourselves," Thompson told AFP, but "we look to them, in some ways, to be our gauge for what we should think and feel."
'Out of touch'
The scholar of creative industries pointed to Tom Hanks' announcement in mid-March that he had contracted coronavirus, saying that news convinced many people the infection was serious.
Indeed, Jenna Anderson said the realities of coronavirus first hit her once Hanks – whom she called a "national-treasure type" – went public with his illness.
The 30-year-old previously living in Australia, where Hanks quarantined, is now isolating with her family in Houston.
But Anderson said while some content has been useful – stars' descriptions of symptoms, for example – "most of what sticks in my mind are negative experiences where celebrities do seem a bit out of touch."
The internet slammed talk show personality Ellen DeGeneres when she joked self-quarantine in her glassy California mansion was like "being in jail."
Arnold Schwarzenegger critized spring-breakers from his jacuzzi, cigar in hand, while a coterie of stars led by Gal Gadot became a laughingstock after dropping an awkward cover of John Lennon's "Imagine," including Zoe Kravitz perched by her fireplace while others appeared to be meandering across their estates.
Many stars "seem to really try to keep in the forefront of people's minds in a way that seems unnecessary to me, based on what I assume about how much money they have and how successful they are," Anderson said.
Still, Thompson said "we've always had this sense that celebrities come and take us away from the hard times."
During World War II, for example, the US government called Hollywood stars to visit troops or promote war bond sales.
Many celebrities today have deployed their wealth, including entertainment mogul Rihanna's donation of medical equipment to New York state and $5 million to several relief organizations, or Beyonce's $6 million donation to nonprofits.
Country icon Dolly Parton meanwhile is financing Vanderbilt University research efforts for a vaccine.
Beyond the cash, entertainment can soothe – and Thompson predicted the trauma of the current moment could fuel more intriguing art in years to come.
"The struggle has always brought with it amazing creative outputs," she said.
Until then there is plenty of celebrity content relying less on platitudes, and more on entertaining the masses by leaning into the absurd.
Britney Spears has been offering eyebrow-raising comic relief including an abrupt tale of the time she "burned down her gym" – no one was harmed – while Mad Men star January Jones has taken on the role of quarantine eccentric, offering a recipe for a "human stew" detox bath.
And Jurassic Park actor Sam Neill has been posting playful albeit slightly unhinged videos – including a bit where he voices a garden gnome who schools listeners on self-isolation. – Rappler.com

    <h5 class="mb-1">John Cena shares Irrfan Khan's image on Instagram as tribute</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES: After mourning the demise of the late veteran actor Rishi Kapoor, WWE champion and Hollywood actor John Cena has now taken to social media to pay homage to Irrfan Khan, who too passed away.
Remembering Irrfan, Cena posted a picture of the former from his famous movie "Life of Pi".
Reacting to the post, several users thanked Cena for paying tribute to Irrfan.
"You care for the Indian people ..love you Cena," a social media follower commented.
Irrfan breathed his last on April 29 at the age of 54. He was admitted to Mumbai's Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital with a colon infection earlier this week. However, he succumbed to his ailment.

This is not the first time that Cena has posted a picture of an Indian celebrity. His account also includes pictures of the likes of the batting legend Sachin Tendulkar, actress Shilpa Shetty and "Bigg Boss 13" contestant Asim Riaz.

    <h5 class="mb-1">“I’ll be back, InshAllah”: Irrfan Khan’s Pakistani co-star Adnan Siddiqui reveals 3 untold stories; inability to act in James Bond film prompted Life of Pi actor to aspire for Hollywood</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan Khan’s Pakistani co-star Adnan Siddiqui has revealed the last words uttered by the legendary Indian actor to him when he went to meet him in London in 2018. Adnan also shared three untold stories including one where late Irrfan’s inability to act in a James Bond film prompted the Life of Pi actor to aspire for Hollywood. Adnan also shared an incident showing the perfectionist side of late Irrfan Khan, whose tragic death last week at the age of 53 stunned Bollywood and his fans globally. Adnan, who worked alongside legendary Irrfan in A Mighty Heart, said that Irrfan’s death had left him ‘disturbed and gutted.’
In a profound note, Adnan wrote, “Disturbed and gutted!! A fine soul gone too soon. I had the honour of first meeting Irrfan as a co-star on the sets of ‘A Mighty Heart.’ For one of the scenes after learning his lines I saw him doing the scene again and again which left me puzzled.”
Adnan said that he could not stop himself from approaching Irrfan to ask, “Irrfan Sahab ye kya kar rahe hain aap? (What are you doing?) He replied, ‘we’re both playing CID agents which means we’ll be showing our ID cards everywhere. I’m practicising the scene so I don’t look clumsy while showing the ID card.’ And that was the first time I realised what a fine actor he was.”
Adnan said that they became good ‘friends on the sets and used to hang out together after the shoot.’ Sharing another incident, Adnan said, “I remember for another scene, he wanted to know a word in Urdu used commonly in Pakistan and he asked me. He was a great actor but didn’t shy away from learning and perfecting his art.”
According to Adnan, Irrfan told him once why he was determined to act in a Hollywood movie. It was because he continued, Irrfan had once got a role ‘of an extra actor in the James Bond series Octopussy, which was shot in India.’
“But because they (Irrfan and his friends) cycled to the set, they were late and the shoot was over. He told me that since then he wanted to do a Hollywood movie. Our careers in Hollywood started together, but he proved his mettle and conquered the fort,” Adnan added.
Adnan said that he met the legendary actor in 2018 for the last time when Irrfan looked positive. His last words, according to the Pakistani actor, were, “Adnan, I’ll be fine very soon and I’ll be back. InshAllah!”
Adnan was recently in the news after he sent an apology to the families of Irrfan Khan and Sridevi for being part of a show where a disgraceful Pakistani TV anchor made fun of their deaths.
Irrfan died in Mumbai last week after battling cancer for two years.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WWE superstar John Cena pays homage to Irrfan Khan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WWE superstar John Cena shared a post on social media for Bollywood legend Irrfan Khan, who passed away on April 29 after a prolonged battle with cancer.
Cena, who is a 16-time WWE champion, is now a full-time actor. However, the Cenation leader has never worked with Irrfan, who featured in several Hollywood films. Irrfan’s first big break was in British Indian filmmaker Asif Kapadia’s film The Warrior (2001).
Cena’s tribute to Irrfan has gained a lot of attention on social media. A couple of days back, Cena had also posted a photo of late Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor. Here is Cena’s post for the Bollywood legend-
When he visited The Indian Express in 2013, the actor, who had already won a Padma Shri for his acting performances, said he had chosen to pursue acting over sports since he felt he could pursue it for longer.
In 2017, Irrfan appeared on the chat show Son of Abish and spoke about his love for sports and how he was forced to give up on cricket.
“I wanted to become a cricketer and make a career out of it. I was an all-rounder and the youngest one in my team in Jaipur. While I did love batting more, our captain liked my bowling and thereby made me a bowler,” said Irrfan, a self-proclaimed MS Dhoni fan.
He is survived by his wife, Sutapa Sikder, and sons Babil and Ayan. He last appeared in Hindi film Angrezi Medium, a sequel to the hit Hindi Medium that he had starred in.

Irrfan Khan's death came as a big blow to the entire film industry. The actor succumbed to cancer last week and passed away in Mumbai's Kokilaben Ambani Hospital. Fans and celebrities are still mourning the irreparable loss. However, Irrfan's elder son Babil is making it a point to spread positivity and happiness amid such distressing times, by sharing some of the other precious pictures and videos of the late actor. Well, his latest post is no less than a priceless treasure.
The vintage pictures see a young Irrfan Khan from his National School of Drama days when he learnt the art of acting. The first picture is a candid shot that sees the Hindi Medium actor sitting on the ground with specs on and a cigarette in his mouth. Moving onto the next picture, a handsome Irrfan was seated on the top, as he practiced with his colleagues.  The last picture had Irrfan amid his performance or another practice session. It is impressive how Irrfan's expressions even then were convincing and top-notch, hence we aren't surprised the actor wowed all of us with her spectacular performances on the big screen. We miss him so much already!
Babil's caption read, "NSD."  Fans and stars were quick to pour in their love. Prior to this, Babil had shared an endearing video of Irrfan having pani puri with the caption, "When you're on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani puri."

On the next day of Irrfan's demise, Babil had shared a heartwarming letter thanking everyone for their support. He had written, "I'm deeply grateful for all the condolences you beautiful friends are pouring in for me. Although, I hope you understand that right now I'm not being able to reply because my vocabulary is dizzy. I will get back to each one of you but just not right now. Thank you so much! I love you.” (ALSO READ - Irrfan Khan's Family Keeps His Twitter Account Alive, Wife Sutapa Sikdar, Sons Babil-Ayaan Khan Post Heart-Wrenching Letter)

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WWE superstar and actor John Cena has always shown affection for India and especially Indian celebs. He recently took to his Instagram and gave a tribute to late actor Rishi Kapoor, who passed away on the 30th of April. John just shared a picture of the veteran without living any message and now, he has done the same for late Irrfan Khan.
Actor Irrfan Khan passed away on the 29th of April and fans from all across the world mourned his loss. Apart from his brilliant acting skills, Irrfan was always praised for his down-to-earth nature, which is why he was so popular amongst Hollywood celebs too. Recently, John Cena paid his special tribute to the versatile performer.
John Cena shared a picture of Irrfan from Life Of Pi movie from his Instagram account. Just like in the case of Rishiji, he didn’t caption the image but his picture spoke a lot.
Just like John Cena, a lot of celebrities from around the world paid tribute to him. Hollywood actors like Angelina Jolie, Chris Pratt, Natalie Portman and many others remembered him and offered condolences.
Meanwhile, speaking about late Rishi Kapoor, Cena gave him a tribute by sharing a smiling picture of him. He did not caption it but fans have left comments on it.
One wrote: “Legend posting about legend.”
Another wrote: “Legend never dies #RipRishiKapoor.”
This is not the first time that Cena has posted a picture of a Bollywood celebrity. During “Bigg Boss 13”, he had taken to Instagram to post a picture of season contestant, model Asim Riaz. Back then, too, Cena did not caption the picture.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan Khan, the supremely talented actor bid goodbye to this world on April 29, 2020. The entire Indian film industry has been mourning the death of the Angrezi Medium actor from the past few days. Along with the industry members, renowned author Paulo Coelho paid tribute to Irrfan Khan recently through a Twitter post.
Paulo Coelho took to his official page and remembered the talented actor by posting his picture, and paid tribute to him with a Bhagavad Gita quote. 'A star joins other stars in the sky. Thank you for everything, Irrfan Khan. "Death is as sure for that which is born, as birth is for that which is dead. Therefore grieve not for what is inevitable." - Bhagavad Gita', wrote Coelho in his post.
As per reports, the popular writer is an ardent fan of Irrfan Khan and has watched most of his popular films. Like all his fans around the world, Irrfan's death has deeply saddened Paulo Coelho, too.
Paulo Coelho is also a fan of another Bollywood actor, superstar Shah Rukh Khan. SRK also paid tribute to Irrfan Khan, saying, "My friend...inspiration & the greatest actor of our times. Allah bless your soul Irrfan bhai...will miss you as much as cherish the fact that you were part of our lives. "पैमाना कहे है कोई, मैखाना कहे है दुनिया तेरी आँखों को भी, क्या क्या ना कहे है" Love u".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amitabh Bachchan calls Irrfan Khan's death 'tragic', posts video tribute for Rishi Kapoor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Megastar Amitabh Bachchan believes the demise of his "Piku" co-star Irrfan Khan is "tragic" because his potential as an actor was left "unrealised".
The 77-year-old actor on Saturday posted a tribute to both Irrfan and veteran actor Rishi Kapoor who died within a day of each other after their respective battles with cancer.
In the post on Instagram, Bachchan touched upon "the death of an elder celebrity vs death of a younger one" topic.
"The death of an elder celebrity vs death of a younger... the grief of the latter more intense than that of the former... Why...? The younger more tragic?
"Why the loss of the young seems more tragic than that of the older? Because you lament the loss of opportunity in the latter... unrealised possibilities," the megastar wrote.
Irrfan, 54, lost his battle with a rare form of cancer and died in a Mumbai hospital on Wednesday. The actor was popular for his stellar performances in films such as "Maqbool", "The Warrior", "Paan Singh Tomar", The Namesake", "Jurassic World" and "Hindi Medium".
A veteran of Bollywood with over 150 films to credits during his five decade long career, Rishi died on Thursday at HN Reliance hospital here after a two year long battle with leukaemia.
On Friday, Bachchan posted a video tribute to Rishi, with whom he acted in films such as "Kabhie Kabhie", "Amar Akbar Anthony", "Naseeb", "Coolie", "Ajooba" and "102 Not Out".
The over five-minute-long black-and-white video features various stills from "102 Not Out". Bachchan can be heard singing a rendition of classic song "Waqt ne kiya kya haseen sitam" in the background.
The megastar wrote in the caption, "Waqt.. Waqt ne kiya kya haseen sitam .. Tum rahe na tum, hum rahe na hum."

Jeffrey was able to clear his schedule when Garten and Stephen Colbert did a giant cocktail reprise on The Late Show, where she also shared why she wanted to get drunk at 9:30 in the morning and post it on Instagram. “I had this glass and I thought, oh, this would be really funny. I had no idea what was going to happen, it was like a bomb exploded,” Garten explained about the viral video. “That says something about my friends that they think I need a glass this size. It was a gift!” She also wants us to know that there are no culinary rules in the coronavirus era, so go nuts. “You’re quarantined, you can do whatever you want whenever you want,” Garten added. “You can have chocolate cake in the morning and breakfast for dinner.” And as for Jeffrey, “he’s a good sport” about everything, as if we needed confirmation.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PETER Andre hilariously compares his son Junior, 14, to Eminem as he pokes fun at the teen’s brooding selfie.
The singer left a comment on Junior’s Instagram snap and his fans loved the adorable interaction.
Peter is proving to be a typical dad as he embarrasses his child on social media.
The dad-of-four couldn’t resist poking fun at his eldest son on Instagram after the teen posted a moody snap of him looking in the bathroom mirror.
He wrote next to his son’s photo: “I loved your last album @eminem”
Almost hearing the eye roll, Junior replied: “jokeman”
Just last Pete shared a video of Junior rapping along to a track in his kitchen tonight, despairing: "What is he doing?"
Then, pointing out a pink case that had been strewn on the floor, he asked, in true exasperated-dad fashion: "And why is this on the floor?"
In the background Junior is seen swinging his arm to US rapper Logic singing: "Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses, everybody livin' on the surface."
Peter, perhaps disappointed his son wasn't reciting the lyrics to his No1 hit Mysterious Girl, shouted over at him in bewilderment.
The singer has been running around after his children at their Surrey home for weeks now as wife Emily works on the NHS front line as a junior doctor.
And it's a full house at the moment with Junior and Princess, 12 - his children with ex-wife Katie Price, staying at his alongside Amelia, six, and Theo, three - his kids with Emily.
He has often posted video of him cleaning the place up, recently sharing Stacey Solomon-style before-and-after videos of the mess and his home looking gleaming afterwards.
Earlier this month it seemed that Pete was at his wit's end as he tried to homeschool and look after his kids.
He shared a video where youngest son Theo apparently flipped his dad the bird, while Princess twerked to the song Bubble Butt.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Peter Andre jokingly compares his son junior, 14, to rapper Eminem on Instagram</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Peter Andre joked that his son looked like US rapper Eminem after he shared a moody selfie snap on Instagram.
Junior, 14, could be seen looking down at his phone as he posed in a bathroom wearing a dark blue hoody.
In response the singer, 47, joked that his son looked like the rapper and tagged him in a hilarious comment.
He wrote: "Loved your last album @eminem"
He then continued to rib his son in the comments section, writing: "Can’t believe Eminem had someone break in his home do people have no respect don’t understand why people do things like this x"
Peter later reiterated that his remarks with meant in jest, saying: "jokeman".
The Mysterious Girl hitmaker's comments come after he shared a funny video earlier this week of his son rapping along to song Isis by US rapper Logic.
The teenager was seen slinging his arms around as he rapped to the lyrics: "Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses, everybody livin' on the surface."
Junior looked embarrassed as he quickly jumped from the counter and stopping rapping.
"Erm hello," Peter captioned the video.
Junior was given a lockdown buzzcut by his dad earlier this month.
The teenage complained on Instgram afterwards that he loves his hair "so much."
But he later shared a moody snap in which he showed off his new hair, suggesting his new look might have grown on him.
The youngster rocked a white hoodie and glared sullenly at the camera as OutKast's hit So Fresh, So Clean blared in the background.
Junior earlier shared a video in which he is seen preparing for his new haircut.
"I'm getting a buzz cut," he lamented, as dad Peter cackled in the background and prepared the shaver.
Peter captioned the video "#lockdownbuzzcut", as Junior wailed: "I love my hair so much."
Junior and Peter are currently on lockdown amid the coronavirus outbreak, along with Junior's sister Princess, 12, Peter's wife Emily, as their two kids Amelia, six, and Theodore, three.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kylie Jenner has touched fans with her grace and gratitude. Travis Scott’s baby mama won her followers this week when she revealed the best thing she ever did in life.
The business mogul made the revelation when she posted a photo of daughter Stormi Webster Friday.
One commenter stated: “Who… done what..!!! Sorry but this’s all travis work you were the egg just you carried her so….. thank you.”
A second observer replied: “You clearly don’t know how much work it is to carry a baby in your body for 9 months.”
A third follower added: “Technically the best thing you ever did was her daddy cuz you had to do him in order to get her😂 but look at those cute curls OMG 🥰.”
Kylie has a lot of reasons to simile in addition to baby Stormi, she just bought a huge mansion in California.
According to recent reports, Kylie has just expanded her real estate empire with a new impressive home in the worth of $36.5 million.
The makeup mogul also owns a house in Hidden Hills, which she bought back in 2016 for $12 million and an investment property in Beverly Hills for $13 million that she shares with the father of her child, Travis.
The luxurious estate is situated in the prestigious neighborhood in Holmby Hills and is spanning over 15,000 square feet and offers seven bedrooms and 14 bathrooms. Also, the property has various bars, games rooms, a sports area, and a professionally equipped kitchen.
The mansion, which was labeled as a “resort compound,” is also said to offer immaculate security with its 24/7 guardhouse, as privacy must be important for Kylie, who is the youngest self-made billionaire.
Even though the initial price of the property was $45 million, the younger sister of Kim Kardashian got a lucrative discount by the previous owner, who reportedly has collaborated professionally with Kylie in the past.
For the time being, it remains unknown if Kylie is going to live full-time in her new estate, or she will continue to be situated in her current main house in Hidden Hills.
Meanwhile, it was reported that now Kylie was not the only billionaire in her family as, according to Forbes, the net worth of Jenner’s brother-in-law, Kanye West, is about $1.26 billion.
However, according to West, his fortune was much more than that and stated that he had $3.3 billion.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Abby Dowse Goes Braless In A Sheer Mesh Outfit & Thigh-High Boots: ‘Meow’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Alexandra Lozovschi
Abby Dowse flaunted her famous curves and sexy pins this morning in a NSFW Instagram upload that is proving hard to ignore. The Aussie bombshell ditched her bra, posing in a black mesh crop top that left her voluptuous assets well within eyesight. The racy look was complete with matching shorts and black leather boots that reached up to her thighs, perfectly showcasing her long, lean legs.
The model snapped a mirror selfie to show off her enviable figure, giving off sultry vibes as she posed on her bedside chair. She was sitting sideways with one leg prompted up on the armrest, flaunting her eye-popping footwear. Her boots had platform soles and chunky heels that accentuated her supple gams, leading the gaze towards her bare thighs — which Abby discreetly flashed in the seductive pose. The posture also showed a glimpse of her chiseled midriff and rock-hard abs, although little could take away the attention from the blonde’s braless curves.
Abby was wearing an off-the-shoulder top, which featured long, fitted sleeves that highlighted her slender arms. The Carmen neckline showed a tantalizing glimpse of cleavage, while the sheer fabric did most of the revealing. The sizzling blonde teased her perky chest in the see-through item, editing the photo to censor her nipple. However, the snap retained its risqué quality, showing enough to remain NSFW.
The crop top cut off just below the chest, flashing a bit of skin before it met the high-rise bottoms. The shorts were a tight-fitting number that hugged her hips, and emphasized her tiny waist and hourglass frame. Both pieces were encrusted with shiny rhinestones that added chic and sophistication to the spicy look. Abby further accessorized her bedazzled outfit with a chain bracelet, which she wore over the mesh sleeve. She slipped on a pair of rings on her flawlessly manicured fingers and adorned her decolletage with a cross-pendant necklace.
The blond beauty wore her long, golden tresses with a mid-part, letting her locks freely fall down her back and over her shoulders. She didn’t appear to be wearing much makeup, showing off her natural beauty.
The photo offered a peek into Abby’s stylish, all-white bedroom, which fans have had the chance to admire in previous, equally sultry posts. Her cat, Lily, also made an appearance in the shot, and could be seen on the floor nuzzling the back of Abby’s chair.
“Meow,” the model captioned her selfie, adding a cat heart eyes emoji.
The steamy upload immediately caught fans’ attention, reeling in more than 3,100 likes in the first 17 minutes of going live. In the space of two hours, the photo amassed close to 13,600 likes and a little shy of 370 comments.
“Those boots,” wrote fellow Australian model Laura Amy, who added a fire emoji for emphasis.
“Wow that outfit,” read another comment, trailed by a black-heart emoji.
“Catwoman,” quipped a third fan, pumping up the number of black-heart emoji to four.
While plenty of followers left gushing messages for the hot model, one person only had eyes for Abby’s feline companion.
“Lily has the same look I get at [sic] every pic of you,” they wrote, adding a ROFL and heart-eyes emoji.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lori Harvey, 23, & Kaia Gerber, 18, Bare Their Abs In Matching Quarantine Workout Looks — Pics</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Quarantine isn’t stopping Kaia Gerberor Lori Harvey from keeping fit! In separate Instagram posts, the pair proved they’re able to exercise (and look chic while doing it) as they remain inside and adhere to the stay-at-home order. In a snap posted on May 1, Lori, 23, rocked a one-shouldered black crop top with matching black yoga pants! The mirror selfie, which was taken in front of a sleek staircase, also showed off her gold watch, long cream nails, and Cartier diamond pave love bracelet which retails for a cool $40,000.
The brunette beauty’s luscious locks were curled, and fell below her shoulders as she kept her makeup look minimal. “If absolute perfection was a person,” one fan commented on the model’s snap! Meanwhile, Kaia was also showing off her toned abs in a mirror selfie wearing a SetActive crop top and leggings. The photo was taken in her closet, as she donned the pretty beige activewear, and allowed her locks to fall just above her shoulders. The model also appeared to have blond highlights framing her face!
The 18-year-old took to her Instagram account earlier in the week shared a selfie featuring one of the little pooches she is fostering during the coronavirus pandemic. In the photo, Kaia snuggled up to the pup while the two laid in bed. The supermodel was completely makeup free, showing off her stunning complexion and bold eyebrows. Kaia softly placed her head near her puppy’s and gazed at the camera. “It’s our fifth nap of the day,” she captioned the post.
Kaia has been taking care of a few adorable little pups for almost a month. On April 11, Kaia and her father, Rande Gerber, 57, were spotted on their way to the Labelle Foundation in Los Angeles to pick up one of their sweet little dogs. Kaia was dressed comfortable and casual for the excursion, showing off her toned abs in a tank crop top and flared jeans with sneakers. Rande helped Kaia gently tuck the little puppy safely into their car before the father-daughter duo headed home to welcome the newest member of their family.
But the adorable little dog in her April 29 Instagram isn’t the only one Kaia’s is fostering. On March 24, Kaia shared a series of posts to her Instagram story featuring the pooches she is taking care of amid the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. She also shared an image of one of the doggos sitting in her lap for a very chill moment. Of course, Kaia also used her platform to urge her fans who had the means to open their homes to a dog who needs a home. “Now is a great time to foster a puppy in need! Reach out if your living/financial situation allows,” Kaia wrote to her fans. Clearly, Kaia is spending her time in quarantine wisely, cuddling up to her new furry friends!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Madison Lennon
American model Jailyne Ojeda Ochoa captivated her 11.6 million Instagram followers on Friday afternoon with a provocative pic of herself wearing red lingerie while at the beach.
In the pic, Jailyne dropped down on all fours and popped her voluptuous booty while looking at the camera. She wore lacy red lingerie, including cheeky panties that accentuated her curvy derrière and an underwire bra that supported her sizeable chest. Aside from her rear end, Jailyne also exposed her shapely shoulders, slender legs, and thick thighs.
She went barefoot for the photoshoot, digging her toes into the sand behind her while her palms lay flat beneath her. To pose for the snap, she looked serene while gazing into the camera and arched her back to make her rear stand out.
Jailyne left her long raven-colored locks loose, they flowed in the breeze coming off the ocean behind her. She rocked a full face of makeup, including a bright pink lip and dramatic eye makeup. She used a mixture of eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara to make her eyes look especially glamorous and finished her look by sculpting her brows.
She did not specify who took the picture or the location where she was photographed.
In her caption, Jailyne said she looked like a mermaid and used a matching emoji to go along with her statement. The remainder of her paragraph joked about her trying to bury her “flying toe” to keep it hidden from view.
She also advertised a new YouTube video recently posted to her channel and asked her fans to follow the link in her bio to subscribe and view it. She used a few other emoji in her caption, including two red hearts, praise-hands, and a smiley face.
Her post racked up over 220,500 likes and more than 1,700 comments from her loyal fan base.
“Thank you for sharing yourself with everyone on YouTube. Great content and very great to see who you really are. Thank you again!!!” raved one fan.
“That arch tho,” gushed another admirer, inserting a peach, drooling, and flame emoji to their comment.
“We all know you are not a mermaid, you are a Goddess,” wrote a third person.
“U would be the prettiest mermaid in the ocean,” chimed in a fourth user, adding four praise-hands emoji to their remark.
The model loves to flaunt her curvy figure regularly on her Instagram page. In April, she shared a few videos on her page that showcased her enviable body, including her cleavage and her behind.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lea Michele finally confirms pregnancy rumours with stunning bump photo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lea Michele has finally confirmed rumours that she is pregnant with her first child.
The former Glee star, 33, took to Instagram on Saturday to post a stunning picture in which she cradles her baby bump.
It comes after reports emerged that Lea and her husband Zandy Reich were expecting a child together.
And her post was the first time she had commented on the news as she posed with her growing bump on show while wearing a beautiful blue maxi dress.
In the photo Lea had a big grin on her face as she looked down at her belly.
Lea wore her brown locks loose around her shoulders and appeared to have minimal makeup on.
She posed in her garden with beautiful plants making up the scenery behind her.
To add to the natural feel of the picture, she appeared to be going barefoot in the grass.
"So grateful," Lea captioned the photo alongside a yellow love heart.
The picture was quickly flooded with well wishes from her celebrity friends.
Emma Roberts commented: "Crying! Screaming!!! Love you!"
"OMG OMG," Ashley Tishdale said with a string of pink love heart emojis.
Her Glee co-star Naya Rivera wrote: "Aww congrats! I love this. You're going to be a great mommy!"
Lea and Zandy met in 2017 and got married last year.
Rumours about her pregnancy sparked a bizarre conspiracy theory about Lea and her Glee character Rachel.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Category is… looking absolutely flawless! Gabrielle Union, 47, appeared half her age in a set of Instagram photos posted on Friday, May 1, during her time in self-isolation. Each pic was totally different from the rest where her radiant beauty was seen throughout. In one snap she cracked a shy smirk which was then followed by her putting her pearly whites on display. A cute smile was seen in the next upload which ended with an adorable photo with her stepdaughter Zaya Wade, 12. “OK y’all so I’ve been working on improving my skin during quarantine (ill share those deets soon) and I feel pretty good about where I’m at but (I) wanted to pop my skin with a little something for these zoom calls without putting on a full face of makeup,” she revealed.
Gabrielle then gave props to none other than Rihanna, 32, for helping her out with her skin issue! “I saw someone online say they only use concealer and bronzer and I was like BUT I tried it and didn’t even use concealer just my @fentybeauty bronzer (Caramel Cutie) and BISHHHH this was the result!!!!” she wrote. “Now, I found my light of course but… okkkkkkkkkk also NOT AN AD, just sharing what I learned. Happy Friday folks!!! Zoom innnnnn on this skinnnnnnnnnnnn.”
The Fenty bronzer and Gabrielle’s already beautiful face was a lethal weapon of gorgeousness that clearly worked. “Thought this was a throwback. Skin is glowing yo!”, host Desus Nice, 38, wrote in the comments section. “Ok, how do you do this? This thing, called aging backwards?!!,” another wrote. “How? Incredible!”
Gabrielle’s also enjoyed some romantic moments with her husband Dwyane Wade, 38, while they remain in self-isolation. They cozied up in their pool on Friday, April 17, where the former Bring It On star sizzled in a sexy blue bikini.

That being said, it’s safe to say that the star looked radiant as she posed from a side angle to show off the belly better while in a maxi dress and wearing the most beautiful accessory – a bright smile.
This comes days after reports that she is pregnant broke out and fans were definitely very happy to see the bump for the first time.
The blue dress she had on made her look like a total goddess and people could not help but gush over her beauty in addition to congratulating her for being pregnant.
As she looked down at her bump while holding it with her hands for the pose, Lea smiled, her long hair cascading down her back.
That picture was already telling the world in a thousand words just how excited and happy she was but she still used two actual words in the caption to make it even more clear: ‘So grateful.’
As you can imagine, a lot of fellow celeb friends were really happy for her and freaked out over the news, including former Scream Queens co-star Emma Roberts, who commented: ‘Crying! Screaming!!! Love you!’
Furthermore, she also received good wishes from Maren Morris who also became a mom just last month!
The news first broke out earlier this week after a source shared with People that Lea was expecting, mentioning that she and her husband Zandy Reich ‘always wanted to be parents.’
This will be the very first time becoming parents for either of them.
Lea and Zandy were engaged for nearly a year before they tied the knot in March of 2019 and seem very happy and in love as they make this huge new step in their lives and relationship.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Even Tim Gunn, the immaculately dressed fashion mentor from “Project Runway” and Amazon’s new competition show “Making the Cut,” is finding it hard to get out of his pajamas these days. As much of the world shelters at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Gunn said he too has given in to comfort over style when he’s at home in his New York apartment. Reuters spoke to Gunn by telephone about how the ongoing quarantine has changed fashion and what might come next on “Making the Cut.” Q: What do you think will happen to fashion now that people have gotten used to working in sweatpants or even their pajamas? A: I have to confess to you I’m one of those people. And it’s really unusual for me. For years I’ve been saying, “if you want to dress to feel as though you never got out of bed, don’t!” But there’s a silver lining to this, at least for me. I now have a great deal of empathy for people who do dress for comfort. I’ve not been wearing sweats, but I have been wearing my pajamas, thinking “well I have no place to go.” When I actually got into regular clothes, and I did because of video conferencing, I felt as though I was wearing a wet suit. I felt so constrained and confined and tethered. I think the psychological and even physical effect of going back to normal clothes makes you just squirm. I have a good deal of empathy for people who really subscribe to the comfort trap. It’s easy to get trapped. But I do have a pact with myself. When I’m wearing pajamas and a robe, I won’t even go down the hall of my apartment building to the trash chute. If I’m leaving the apartment, I get dressed. I’m not in a suit, but I’m wearing proper clothes. Q: So what is proper clothing for you right now when you do go out in the hallway? A: I’d wear a turtleneck and a pair of jeans. Q: Do you think that once we are all allowed out into some kind of new world that there might be a huge embrace of fashion, that maybe people are tired of their sweatpants? A: I fully believe that. I know people who are dressing up every day. They’re not leaving their apartment, but they’re dressing up because they feel that they have infused their lifestyle with some normalcy. Q: Do you know if you’ll have a season two of “Making the Cut” and what it might look like? A: We’re certainly talking about a season two. The plan for doing it this summer is, of course, off. And we are carefully, thoughtfully, recalibrating all of our thinking about the show in regard to social distancing and interactions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A YouTuber tricked celebrities into thinking they were appearing on 'The Late Late Show with James Corden'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YouTuber Josh Pieters has had to be inventive when coming up with his social experiments during lockdown in the UK, as everything, from formulating the plan to setting it in motion, has to be done from his home in London.
However, thanks to the sudden boom in video calling, he managed to convince celebrities they were appearing on “The Late Late Show with James Corden.”
Pieters scraped many of Corden’s old interviews and video segments for sound bites and collected enough to make one side of a believable conversation. There was obviously no video feed, but the guests were told they would be chaperoned by the show’s producer, who was convincingly played by Pieters’ friend and sidekick Archie Manners.
Celebrities and their managers were none the wiser, as so many late night show hosts have been doing interviews from their own homes.
In the first of three videos in the series, British pop star Craig David and the UK’s biggest TikTok star Holly Hubert,who goes by Holly H, were interviewed. While Pieters took care of the voice notes to try and come up with a coherent flow of conversation, Manners kept things moving in his own flat across town, with the help of an imaginary assistant named “Sharon.”
They were also treated to exclusive performances. David sang one of his biggest hits, “Rise and Fall,” while Hubert demonstrated the viral TikTok dance the Renegade.
“As you know, the ‘Late Late Show with James Corden’ is on TV every night, so it’s only right that our show does the same,” Pieters said at the end of the video.
The second video featured Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury from “Love Island” and magician Julius Dein, and was posted on Saturday.
Dein sneaked in a flogging attempt for his magic box, while the couple were asked how they were getting on in quarantine.
The grand finale will air on Sunday, which you will definitely want to tune in for.

“As you know, the ‘Late Late Show with James Corden’ is on TV every night, so it’s only right that our show does the same,” Pieters said at the end of the video.
The second video featured Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury from “Love Island” and magician Julius Dein, and was posted on Saturday.
Dein sneaked in a flogging attempt for his magic box, while the couple were asked how they were getting on in quarantine.
The grand finale will air on Sunday, which you will definitely want to tune in for.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain’s Got Talent Judges wowed by 96-year-old singer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 96-year-old has wowed Britain’s Got Talent – getting the seal of approval from the judges.
Nora Barton, from West Yorkshire, took to the stage at the London Palladium.
Her daughter told the audience: “She’s sung for people all her life so at 96 this is a treat, this stage”.
After receiving a standing ovation from the judges and a huge cheer from the audience, Barton, who wore a flower in her hair and dressed in red, said: “Thank you very much”
Judge David Walliams told her: “You are a very special lady because you’re full of life, laughter and joy and have entertained the nation at 96.”
Amanda Holden said it was a “very special audition” adding: “You’re a generation this country is built on.”
Simon Cowell said: “I didn’t like you very much – I loved you! I think we’ve got about 4,000 yeses Nora.”
Barton, who sang Loveliest Night of The Year, said she was “very pleased” to have been at the auditions.
The ITV show was filmed before the coronavirus pandemic and live episodes have been postponed.
Saturday’s show also featured mother and daughter duo Sammy, 43, and Honey, 14.
Honey said the pair had experienced a “tough” couple of years because “my mum got diagnosed with cancer. ”
Sammy said she is now “absolutely fine” and Honey told the judges: “I’m so grateful for everything. I never thought that when singing along in the car it would bring us to this stage.”
After Cowell told the pair to return with a different song, they impressed the judges with a “faultless” performance.
Holden pressed the golden buzzer, saying, “It was the most wonderful thing to witness”, with Cowell adding: “I’m going to remember that audition for a long, long time.”
The show also featured a children’s choir from Hampshire who performed a song about climate change.
“You are exactly what I was hoping we would find this year,” Cowell said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pensioner Nora Barton wowed the Britain’s Got Talent judges with her voice – and her audition will just melt your heart.
The 96-year-old’s performance will air on tonight’s BGT and from the moment she stepped on stage, she had the judges and the audience in complete awe.
Nora, who was accompanied by her daughter Pam sang a beautiful version of The Loveliest Night Of The Year from the film The Great Caruso.
But before she began to sing she had a chat with the judges.
Amanda Holden asked: ‘Dare I ask how old you are?’
Although Nora couldn’t quite hear Amanda as she turned to her daughter and said: ‘What did she say?’
Her daughter answered: ‘She’s 96.’
The judge then asked: ‘How long have you been playing the piano?’
Nora shakes her head and points to Pam as she said ‘Oh not me, she does.’
‘She has sung for people all of her life,’ Pam explained.
‘And at 96, this is a treat, this stage, the London Palladium.’
No Nora you are the treat!
Britain’s Got Talent continues on Saturday at 8pm on ITV.

On Saturday, Kareena Kapoor Khan shared a picture on Instagram where Saif Ali Khan can be seen trying to trim Taimur’s hair with a pair of scissors while the little boy cooperates patiently. From his expression it seems Taimur does not really mind getting a haircut from dad.
“Haircut anyone?” captioned Kareena Kapoor on her post.
While Karisma Kapoor shared red heart emojis showering love on her cute nephew in the comments section, actress Zareen Khan felt “Taimur has the cutest pout”!
While comments like “sweet”, “cute” and “cutie” flooded the post, Saif’s fans also enjoyed watching him in his new avatar!
A fan wrote: “Stay home, stay Saif”
Another fan quipped: “He is the Saifest Barber.”
A lot of B-Towners and telly stars have been trying to get acquainted with scissors and trimmers for their spouses, kids and other family members amid the lockdown.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Aren’t you supposed to be mourning?: Kareena Kapoor Khan faces grief for posting photo of son Taimur with Dad Saif Ali Khan, two days after uncle Rishi Kapoor’s tragic death</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kareena Kapoor Khan has found herself in a spot of bother on social media after fans began to give her grief accusing her of insensitivity as she posted a photo of son Taimur with Dad Saif Ali Khan just two days after her uncle Rishi Kapoor’s tragic death. Angry fans lashed out at Angrezi Medium actress questioning her moral compass.
This was after Kareena took to Instagram to share a photo of Taimur getting ready for a haircut from his Dad during the nationwide lockdown. Sharing the photo, Kareena wrote, “Haircut anyone? ”
As expected, Taimur’s adorable photo evoked plenty of reactions from fans including his aunt Karisma Kapoor. But, Kareena soon began to face strong backlash from some of her fans who felt that her action was a tad insensitive given that she had just lost her uncle Rishi Kapoor.
One fan wrote, “Your family had such a big loss just a few days ago. How can u joke even?” Another commented, “arent u supposed to be mourning? shouldve respect that by not posting anything on ur ig as if nothing happened.” “Enjoy kese kr lete ho yrr, 2 din bhi pure ni huve abhi tak,” commented another fan.
Veteran actor Rishi Kapoor, Kareena’s uncle, died on Thursday after battling cancer for two years. The news of his death was confirmed by Kareena’s father Randhir Kapoor. Later, the family had also issued an official statement revealing for the first time that the actor was suffering from leukemia, commonly known as blood cancer.
Kareena had taken to Instagram to fondly remember her uncle through a series of throwback photos.
In one photo, late Rishi Kapoor was seen in conversation with Saif’s father Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi on a cricket field. Pataudi, known as Tiger, was the former captain of the Indian cricket team.
Rishi Kapoor’s death has resulted in an outpour of emotional social media posts by the members of the Bollywood fraternity. His former co-star Amitabh Bachchan said that he was ‘destroyed‘ by his death.
Several celebrities including Abhishek Bachchan, Alia Bhatt, Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Anil Ambani and Ayan Mukerji had braved the lockdown to take part in Rishi Kapoor’s funeral.

After sharing some throwback pictures of her late uncle and a spiritual video, Bebo has now gone back to giving us glimpses at #QuaranTimDiaries. She just showed her followers how husband Saif Ali Khan had decided to turn hair stylist for his son Taimur Ali Khan while at home.
Kareena's latest post shows Saif and Taimur, both engrossed in the new task that they have taken up. Saif, dressed in a white cotton kurta and pajama, is in the middle of giving Taimur a haircut. Taimur is sporting a grey tee and is equally interested in seeing his daddy dearest's work. Kareena has captioned the photo with, "Haircut anyone? 💁🏻‍♀️🤭".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paradise City trailer: Musical drama series features Cameron Boyce’s final appearance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A trailer for upcoming musical drama series Paradise City’s season 1 is out. The series marks the final appearance of late American actor Cameron Boyce, known for Disney Channel series The Descendants. The actor passed away in July last year at the age of 20.
Ash Avildsen has created, written and directed the series. Paradise City is about the rock scene and is clearly geared towards teenagers and young adults and promises a psychedelic musical drama experience. Specifically, it explores a rock star and his connection to devil worship and other occult stuff.
Andy Black, Bella Thorne, Drea De Matteo, and Hopsin also star.
The logline of the series reads, “The lives of a rock star with ties to the occult and a young rookie kid who idolizes him collide through their broken homes built by the music business.”
The official Instagram handle of the series shared an emotional message for Boyce along with one of his photos from the series. The tribute read, “Cameron Boyce stars as a leading character “Simon” in all eight episodes of the first season of Paradise City. The series was filmed just months before his tragic passing. He gave us an incredible performance as a young musician, band leader and aspiring DIY executive in the music business. Cameron was a truly one of a kind spectacular talent. ❤️💙💜 Every scene he was written in was shot and completed in the first season. We will be donating a portion of the tv show’s profits to @thecameronboycefoundation #cameronboyce #paradisecityshow.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paradise City trailer sees Cameron Boyce in final role before death</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The trailer for Paradise City has dropped and features the late Cameron Boyce in his final role before his sudden death last year.
The upcoming new show, which is set to debut later this year, follows aspiring musician Simon (played by Boyce) and a rock star he worships as their worlds become intertwined.
‘Do you think that devil worship is real in Hollywood, like the whole black magic and all that stuff,’ the star’s character asks in the gripping teaser.
‘Oh, I definitely think there’s good and evil spirits, and black magic is real,’ Perrey Reeves’ character responds.
Entourage’s Rhys Coiro and Bella Thorne also feature in the new eight-part series, created by Ash Avildsen.
Boyce passed away aged 20 on 6 July 2019 after suffering a seizure in his sleep due to epilepsy.
Last month, the cast of Jessie gathered virtually to pay tribute to their co-star Cameron, nearly a year after the young actor’s sudden death.
Peyton List thanked the late actor for teaching her ‘so much’ and making her ‘such a better person’, while Skai Jackson admitted she had been ‘so excited’ to meet the star before auditioning for the Disney Channel show.
Cameron portrayed Luke Ross on the programme, and Peyton and Skai played his sisters Emma and Zuri Ross.
According to the Los Angeles Country Medical Examiner-Corone, Boyce had a ‘sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.
The Descendants’ actor’s family further confirmed after the report was revealed: ‘Cameron’s tragic passing was due to a seizure as a result of an ongoing medical condition, and that condition was epilepsy.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The late Cameron Boyce can be seen in his final on-screen performance in the teaser trailer for “Paradise City.” Watch the embed above.
“Paradise City” centers on the lives of a rock star with ties to the occult and a young rookie kid who idolizes him, as they collide through their broken homes built by the music business. The former Disney star passed away last year at age 20 from an epilepsy attack.

At age 9, the freckle-faced Los Angeles native made his acting debut in the 2008 horror film “Mirrors” and then appeared in the 2010 blockbuster comedy “Grown Ups” as one of the sons of Adam Sandler’s character.
In the early 2010s, he starred as mischievous Luke Ross opposite Debby Ryan’s title character in “Jessie,” which ran for four seasons on the Disney Channel. He then played Carlos de Vil, the son of “101 Dalmatians” villain Cruella de Vil, in the “Descendants” series of movies for the cable network.

    <h5 class="mb-1">With Hollywood, Ryan Murphy Gives Cinema's Outsiders the Happy Ending They Deserved</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On an ordinary quarantine-era Monday in April, a bolt of joy shot through the Internet courtesy of producers Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan. The first trailer for their Netflix miniseries Hollywoodpromised a sexy gas station, A-list Broadway stars, 1940s glamour, May-December romances and, most importantly, a story that looks at the Hollywood that could have been, with a true resistance to hatred.
Set in the film industry's Golden Age, the series mixes fictional characters with real-life figures like Hattie McDaniel, Anna May Wong, and Rock Hudson. It takes a revisionist lens to the era, giving characters from marginalized groups storylines in which they fulfill their dreams. “I was interested in doing something very optimistic and very uplifting and giving these disenfranchised people happy endings,” Murphy says.
The show is the mega-producer's second with Netflix as part of a 2018 deal he signed with the company, thought to be the largest TV contract in history. The partnership marks a new phase in his career and only fuels his already prodigious output. He’s currently at work on a feature film adaptation of the play The Boys in the Band, a miniseries version of A Chorus Line, season 2 of The Politician, a series focused on One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest’s Nurse Ratched, and a film version of the Broadway hit The Prom, all for Netflix. That’s in addition to new seasons of Pose, American Crime Story (this time focusing on Monica Lewinsky), and American Horror Story, all on FX.
In a spare brief moment between projects, Murphy spoke to ELLE.com about Hollywood’s dark history, his eye for new talent, and the freedom of showing nudity on Netflix.
I think it was a combination of two things. I was raised by my grandmother. She was a big movie fan, so I grew up watching a lot of old movies and reading a lot of golden-era Hollywood books. There were three people I was always interested in: Rock Hudson, Anna May Wong, and Hattie McDaniel. I was always moved by how they never got their happy ending, how they had to live inauthentically and were never given the opportunities they deserved.
After I did Versace, I was interested in the world of that gas station in Hollywood [in his memoir, "fixer" Scotty Bowers recounted being employed at a gas station that offered sex work in the ‘40s], not so much because of the sordid sexual stuff, but the idea that people had to go to a gas station to find companionship or sexuality in a world where they could be arrested or even killed for being authentically who they were.
What's interesting is I'd worked with almost all of the “older” actors before. I've worked with Jim Parsons and Joe Mantello and Patti LuPone and Darren Criss and David Corenswet. We were all friends. But I was really interested in going after young, sparkling new voices with this show.
The hardest part that took me the longest time to cast was Rock Hudson. I read hundreds and hundreds of guys for that part. Many of them looked a lot like Rock. And in the case of Jake [Picking], he gave a really interesting audition. I thought he was great, but I still wasn't sure. So I wanted to meet him and he came in and sat in my office and talked to me about his life and how he had been new to Hollywood and how hard it was. He had spent many nights up watching Golden-era movies. I was so moved by him that we did a makeup test and added a lot of prosthetics to him and we were all just blown away. I think people don't realize there's so much of his face that we [changed]. His eyelids, his chin, his cheeks, his teeth, his nose. We really worked hard on that look for him. I'm very proud of how it looks.
What we wanted was somebody to protect Rock Hudson. And that's what he did. He's so good at it and he's so emotional and he holds his own in those big hard scenes with Jim Parsons. Jim came to love him. Everyone just loves Jake.
There's a lot of tears on the final episode and those are real tears. In many cases I used all of the first takes because so many people were so emotional about Anna May Wong and Rock Hudson and Hattie McDaniel, and the new people like Jeremy's character and Laura's character, actually being seen by a system that has for years neglected them. So all those tears were real emotions. It was cathartic making this show because it was thrilling to give justice to that group of people who deserve it.
There's so many of them. I liked all the unexpected relationships. I loved the relationship between Holland Taylor and Dylan McDermott. I loved the relationship between Patti LuPone and her daughter, and also David Corenswet because you don't really see women past 40 ever given a chance to play something romantic or sexualized. It was fun to do that.
But my favorite thing by far was the final episode, because we got to really dig in and we were given the time and the money. That last episode went three weeks over budget and overshooting because it took so much time to get it all right. Historically right. That was my favorite thing that we did—not only was it emotional, but I loved that set. I loved those clothes, I loved the props.
I've never been able to do full male nudity until now—and also full female nudity, I might add. That was liberating. I've spent a lot of time in my career having ridiculous conversations about nipples. I cannot tell you how many conversations where I'm like ‘Really?!’ To be able to just go for it is great.
We had always planned on this coming out. We've been working for a year toward this date. It's a very dark time. It's a very scary time. It's a very troubling time. I know that I personally am looking for things to watch to feel uplifted and hopeful. I think this show has the exact thing we're looking for at this moment. It leaves you with a feeling of maybe things could be better. Maybe the good guys will win, maybe we're going to be okay, and we can come together as a group to change the world. That's what this merry band of people are doing in this finale.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Black Panther' screenwriter Joe Robert Cole on directing his gritty new Netflix movie 'All Day and a Night'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At 40 years old, Joe Robert Cole is one of the most sought after screenwriters working today in Hollywood thanks to his work in TV (“The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story”) and movies (“Black Panther”).
But for his latest project, he’s moving away from helping the vision of people like Ryan Murphy and Ryan Coogler to set out and direct his own story.
“All Day and a Night” (available on Netflix) is an unforgiving look at Jahkor (Aston Sanders of “Moonlight”), an Oakland kid who is trying to make a better life for his newborn baby with his skills as a rapper but finds himself falling into a life of crime that puts him in jail alongside his gang banging father, James (Jeffrey Wright).
This a story that Cole wanted to tell long before “Black Panther” was made. A decade to be exact. And it’s in many ways the first time audiences will get something that comes directly from Cole (even for his directorial debut, “Amber Lake,” he admits the project was very collaborative with the actors).
“I view myself as a super collaborative person,” Cole told Insider with a laugh. “Yes, this is my film, it’s definitely different than what I’ve done. But I love collaboration. Creating something greater than you can on your own.”
But for the first time in his career, he’s the tone in the director’s chair, which means he’s the one with the final say and the vision – regardless of the amount of collaboration. And for “All Day and a Night,” he set out to give an unforgiving look at what he observed growing up around the San Francisco Bay area.
“My grandmother used to say, ‘Our family didn’t grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths.'”
The light bulb for “A Day and a Night” really came into focus when Cole was in college at the University of California, Berkeley.
“I spent a lot of time between classes and semesters with people in these same environments that are in the movie,” Cole said. “I’m a square so I make no claims to having any kind of street crew, but I got to see the humanity in these people that I was interacting with.”
And Cole said that’s the biggest thing he wants people to take away from the journey we see Jahkor go on in the movie. To see “the people in those communities in a more humane light.”
Though the comparison to a raw inner-city crime movie like “Menace II Society” is expected by Cole (and he admits he probably mentioned that movie when pitching it to Netflix), he also hopes it can stand on its own. Especially in how it depicts the characters of Jahkor and James in prison.
“My film isn’t about the black community, just like a white crime film isn’t about all white people,” Cole said. “What Jah is grappling with is trying to understand how the systemic walls that are put around him outside of prison, in his community, are not that different than the walls he sees inside prison. It is him trying to find hope in the one place that he can control through the journey of this film which is inside himself. That’s the thrust of what I’m trying to get at. There are these societal structural challenges that particularly African-Americans in these underserved communities have to face. I feel oftentimes no one speaks to the reality of the circumstance they are in.”
Going forward still expect Cole to pen comic book-based projects. He’s currently adapting the Vault Comics title “Failsafe” (a project also for Netflix), with Michael B. Jordan producing. But at the same time, Cole also wants to continue to direct movies like “All Day and a Night,” where the story is shedding light on someone you wouldn’t expect you’d be interested in.
“What I wanted to achieve was taking the audience on a journey and humanising someone we often struggle to see the humanity in,” he said. “I was constantly working on finding the humanity in the stylised crime genre.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Searchlight Pictures has acquired an untitled comedy pitch from “Parks and Recreation” and “Sonic the Hedgehog” star Ben Schwartz, and both he and Sam Rockwell are set to star in the film, an individual with knowledge of the project told TheWrap.
Schwartz will write the screenplay for the film based on his pitch. Both he and Rockwell will star and executive produce in the untitled comedy.
Logline details are being kept under wraps.
Schwartz most recently wrote, starred in and produced a Netflix improv comedy special with “Silicon Valley” star Thomas Middleditch. He also reunited with the cast of NBC’s “Parks and Recreation” on Thursday for a remote special episode of the show. He provided the voice for the speedy blue hedgehog in Paramount’s “Sonic” video game adaptation, and he’ll also appear in the “Space Force” series alongside Steve Carell.
Rockwell most recently starred in Searchlight Pictures’ Best Picture nominee “Jojo Rabbit” from director Taika Waititi and in Clint Eastwood’s “Richard Jewell.” He lent a voice to Universal’s “Trolls World Tour” and will also appear as a voice actor in Disney’s “The One And Only Ivan.”
Schwartz is represented by Haven and Gang Tyre. Rockwell is represented by Gersh and Untitled.
The Hollywood Reporter first reported the news of the project.
For the record: A previous version of this article stated that this project would be Schwartz’s debut feature screenplay.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Where do you know the cast of Netflix's Hollywood from?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Director Ryan Murphy has returned with another intense series, Hollywood, starring many familiar faces and and a moving plot line.
The Netflix series, which dropped on 1 May, is a piece of revisionist history which shows what Hollywood could have been if it had been a little bit more open-minded back in the day.
Known for Glee, American Horror Story and Pose, it was no surprise that Murphy would provide a show that would make us cry and laugh all at once.
And for those who know of the director’s work, Ryan is a big fan of using cast members from his other shows, and this one’s no different.
Darren Criss has been a long-time favourite of Ryan, starring as half-Filipino aspiring film director Raymond Ainsley who hopes to break boundaries in the Hollywood film industry.
The star is most obviously familiar from Glee, on which he portrayed Blaine Anderson, great singer and partner of Kurt (Chris Colfer).
His next Ryan-related role was the Hotel season of American Horror Story, on which he appeared for two episodes as Justin in 2015.
He then came back for American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace as Andrew Cunanan, the man who murdered the fashion designer in 1997.
Laura Harrier starred as Camille Washington, a black actress facing prejudice because of her race, and Raymond’s girlfriend.
She rose to fame with Marvel’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, in which she portrayed Liz, Peter Parker’s love interest.
From then, she went straight to play Patrice Dumas in BlacKkKlansman, a movie following the first Black detective in Colorado Springs’ police department as he set out to infiltrate and expose the local Ku Klux Klan chapter.
The 30-year-old has also modelled for campaigns with companies such as Urban Outfitters, American Eagle, Target, ALDO, Steve Madden, Calvin Klein and Louis Vuitton.
David Corenswet embodies Jack Castello, a World War II veteran who moves to Hollywood in hopes of becoming a great actor.
The star had a lot of small parts, appearing in House of Cards in 2018 and Instinct that same year.
His big break came with Netflix’s The Politician, where he plays River Barkley.
The show concerns an ambitious student Payton Hobart who runs for student body president against the popular and athletic River.
Umm, Dylan McDermott actually plays gas station owner (and pimp) Ernest West and they did a great job on making him look older.
The actor was the shining star in the first season of American Horror Story as Dr Ben Harmon and came back for AHS: 1984 as Bruce and AHS: Asylum as Johnny Morgan.
Dylan and David already know each other from their time on The Politician before rejoining for the new Netflix series.
He also starred in shows such as Hostages, Stalker, LA To Vegas and The Practice.
Samara Weaving played the part of Claire Wood, an up-and-coming actress, Camille’s rival, and the daughter of Ace and Avis Amberg (who own Ace Studios).
The star’s most acclaimed film includes her part as Penelope in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.
Appearing alongside Bella Thorne, the 28-year-old had a role in horror movie The Babysitter.
She also starred in Ready or Not and Guns Akimbo alongside Daniel Radcliffe.
Maude Apatow plays Jack Castello’s pregnant wife Henrietta Castello.
If you haven’t already recognised from the name, she’s the eldest daughter of director Judd Apatow.
She is part of the main cast of Euphoria, playing Lexi Howard, Zendaya’s characters best friend.
She also starred in Knocked Up, Funny People, This Is 40 and Assassination Nation.
Hollywood is available to stream on Netflix.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why A Movie Like 'Dreamland' From 'Hollywood' Took So Much Longer To Get Made</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Spoilers ahead for Season 1 of Hollywood. At the end of Netflix's Hollywood, production begins on Dreamland, a movie written by Henry Willson about two men who fall in love. It's positioned as the first film about a same-sex love story, but the only realistic thing about it is that it stars a straight actor as one half of the gay couple. The premise would have been unheard of for a major motion picture in the 1940s.
Though the first same-sex movie kiss is actually considered to have happened quite early, in the 1927 silent film Wings, a production code was put into place from roughly 1930 through 1968 that required movies to be more "wholesome" and "moral," and to encourage what the studios called "correct thinking," per NPR.
Hollywood takes place in roughly 1948, when the code would have prevented a movie like Dreamland from being made for mainstream audiences. But the Netflix show reimagines a history in which it could have been. It also rewrites Dreamland star Rock Hudson's story. In Hollywood, he comes out with his fictional boyfriend Archie Coleman at the 20th Academy Awards and then gets to star in gay love story. In reality, he was a closeted gay man whose sexuality wasn't made public until he died from AIDS-related complications in 1985. It's also taken the film industry a lot longer to properly represent gay people onscreen.
Wings was not a movie about a gay couple. The kiss was shared between a dying soldier and his comrade, who insisted they were just really good friends. Movies specifically about gay relationships didn't come to the forefront until the late '60s and early '70s, once the repressive production code had been lifted.
One of the first films to authentically portray gay life was the 1970 film The Boys in the Band. It helped paved the way for more representation, including modern films like Brokeback Mountain (2005) and Moonlight (2016), both gay films that also received awards show recognition.
Still, there's a long way to go. Hollywood needs to make all kinds of movies by and about gay people: harrowing coming out tales, cheesy rom-coms, and everything in between. Movies like The Thing About Harry (2020) and Love, Simon (2018) have helped to move the needle, but those are both male love stories. Gay women, bisexual people, nonbinary people, and transgender people also need to be fully represented across all races and stories before true equality can be achieved.
Perhaps if movies like Dreamland had been able to be made back in the '40s, we'd be looking at a much different movie landscape today.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As if it wasn't already ubiquitous, Megan Thee Stallion just catapulted her latest single, "Savage." The rapper just released a remix featuring Beyoncé, with proceeds benefiting coronavirus relief efforts in their shared hometown of Houston.
The remix, which has all the makings of a song of the summer, offers a rare instance of Beyoncé rapping. ("Diva," "Feeling Myself," and "Apesh*t" are other notable instances that come to mind.) In a verse alluding to the song's popularity on TikTok, Beyoncé says, "Hips tick-tock when I dance." Another lyric practically primed for an Instagram caption goes, "If you don't jump to put jeans on / Baby, you don't feel my pain." Listen to the song above before it soon becomes inescapable.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jungkook has fans swooning thanks to an unexpected cover of Lauv's "Never Not."
In a video posted on Twitter, the BTS member -- sitting on a bed -- sweetly sang the ballad, the closing track of Lauv's I met you when I was 18. (the playlist) project.
Jungkook left a simple caption -- "Never Not," along with a purple heart emoji -- on the clip, which ended abruptly with him turning the camera off about a minute-and-a-half into the song. At press time, his video amassed more than six million views in just a couple hours and had his name trending on Twitter.
BTS and Lauv have joined forces previously on the K-pop stars' "Make It Right" as well as "Who," off of Lauv's new album How I'm Feeling.
"I went into this album expecting no features and then they just all happened in a very natural way. I just met BTS at their show and they asked me to do the remix for their song and I was like, 'Duh.' Then I was like, 'Oh maybe they'll like one of the songs from my album.' So I sent them 'Who,' the demo, and they loved it," he recently said of their collaborations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">David Walliams brands Jamie Redknapp's gorgeous mum Sandra, 74, a 'Hot Mama'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TV funnyman David Walliams has branded Jamie Redknapp's mum a 'hot mama'.
The Britain's Got Talent Judge, 48, was left mighty impressed when footballer Jamie, 46, took to social media to share a tribute to his 74-year-old mother on her birthday.
Taking to Instagram, Jamie shared images of his toned mum Sandra posing in swimwear and showing off her classic good looks with her high cheekbones.
Clearly ageing like a fine wine, svelte Sandra looks incredible in the photos.
Jamie captioned the post: "Happy birthday to this incredible lady. We adore you mum. Thanks for your wisdom, love and care."
The former husband of Louise Redknapp, with whom he shares two sons, also spoke about being separated from his mother during the lockdown procedures enforced by the government as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
"You have been a rock throughout my life, given me support that I hope I can give my kids throughout their lives too. I miss you and I can’t wait to see you.
"No doubt you will be waiting on dad hand and foot today!
"But make sure he looks after you. See you soon when this is over and love you always. Your boy Jamie."
Many of Jamie's followers were loving the pics, but none more so than Mr Little Britain himself, David Walliams.
David commented on the post: "Hot Mama."
Jamie wasn't the only one who was sharing a tribute to Sandra, as it was also his father and her husband, football legend Harry Redknapp.
"Happy birthday Sandra I love you more now than the day I met you if that’s possible," wrote Harry on his Instagram account.
The couple first met in 1963 on the dancefloor of an East London pub when Sandra was 17.
Harry noted when appearing on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!: "We were only just 17 when we started going out, and we’ve never been apart since. I love her like mad – she’s my life."
He later went on to win the 2018 series of the show and was crowned King of the Jungle.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former footballer turned sports pundit Jamie Redknapp has paid tribute to his mother on her 74th birthday.
Sandra, who is married to former I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! Harry Redknapp, looks sensational in the pics.

Jamie, 46, shared the series of snaps of his mum in view of his 1.2 million Instagram followers.
He captioned the photo with: "Happy birthday to this incredible lady. We adore you mum.
"Thanks for your wisdom, love and care.
"You have been a rock throughout my life, given me support that I hope I can give my kids throughout their lives too. I miss you and I can’t wait to see you.

"No doubt you will be waiting on dad hand and foot today! But make sure he looks after you.
"See you soon when this is over and love you always. Your boy Jamie."
Judging by the caption he is likely unable to celebrate her birthday with her in person due to the coronavirus lockdown restrictions.
The first picture shows him smiling at a restaurant alongside his glam mum. The next picture shows Sandra with who we believe are to be four of her five grandchildren.
And the final snap shows Sandra enjoying a glass of white wine as she lounges bikini-clad on a sun lounger.
She looks absolutely fantastic in the bikini pic and fans can't get enough of how young and in shape she looks.

One wrote: "Wow no excuse for corona kilos when you see how fit and healthy your mummy is! What a gorgeous lady. Happy Birthday Sandra."
A second gushed: "Wow happy birthday. Your mum looks amazing, I can’t believe she has six pack x."
And a third praised: "Wow look at her incredible figure! Go on Mrs R! Happy birthday and have a lovely day x."
Several of Jamie's celebrity friends also wished his mum a happy day.
Susanna Reid posted: "Love your Mum - Happy Birthday Sandra - look forward to seeing your smiling again at some point."
Former The Apprentice star and current Real Housewives of Beverly Hills husband Paul Kemsley wrote: "Happy Bday Sandra x."
And David Walliams cheekily posted: "Hot Mama" to which Jamie valiantly replied with: "Stop it Walliams! She is taken!"

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘BIP’s Ashley & Jared Say Clare Crawley Will Be A Great Bachelorette: ‘She Knows What She Wants’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bachelor Nation fan-favorites Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon spoke to HollywoodLife exclusively, while social distancing together amid the coronavirus pandemic. The pair revealed why they believe Clare Crawley will be a great Bachelorette star. “She stands up for herself like no other. She believes that she deserves love. She is very confident in herself and I think she’s going to call out guys when they’re not treating her right,” Ashely told us. Jared then added it will make for “great” television. “She also knows what she wants and she’s going to go after what she wants,” he said.
When asked how Clare was doing, amid filming for her season of The Bachelorette being put on-hold, Ashley said she was hopeful. “She’s doing well! I didn’t talk to her specifically about the wait but I think she’s just excited and hopes that they have a lot of good quality men for her when she does get there,” she dished. It comes as Clare seemingly threw shade at Matt James, a contestant on her upcoming season of the reality show. The hunky 28-year-old is well known as former Bachie star Tyler Cameron‘s BFF and an active member of the “Quarantine Crew,” however he also runs a charity called ABC Food Tours.
While giving interviews about the organization, which takes kids from underserved elementary schools to restaurants in their local communities, Matt opened up about his thoughts on Clare — and she wasn’t happy. “If you are doing interviews and creating Cameo accounts before you are even on my season,’ she wrote. ‘You are in it for the wrong reasons… #dontwasteyourtime,” the 39-year-old tweeted on April 25. She also added, “Respect the opportunity you’ve been given. Respect the rules. Respect me.”
Matt’s fans were quick to jump to his defense, however Jared told HL he doesn’t believe Clare was criticizing Matt directly. “To be fair, I’m not sure if she was just shading Matt. From what I heard, there were a few of the guys that were going on Cameo,” he said. “Clare is old school so of course it’s going to bother her if a guy is on there doing interviews.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ashley Iaconetti And Jared Haibon Share Their Opinions On Clare Crawley Being The New Bachelorette!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During a new interview for HollywoodLife, Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon shared their opinions on Clare Crawley becoming the newest Bachelorette and more! Here’s what they had to say!
While in quarantine together, the happy couple had a chat with the site and among other things, revealed they think Clare will make an amazing Bachelorette!
Not only that but they even went into detail explaining why they believe that is, pretty much gushing over her!
Ashley dished that ‘She stands up for herself like no other. She believes that she deserves love. She is very confident in herself and I think she’s going to call out guys when they’re not treating her right.’
Jared thought about the audience side of things as well, adding that it will make for ‘great television.’
‘She also knows what she wants and she’s going to go after what she wants,’ the man also explained about the future Bachelorette.
Of course, Clare’s season on the dating show has actually been put on hold because of the coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic so Ashley was asked how she’s been doing amid all of it.
Ashely stressed that she is hopeful, adding that ‘She’s doing well! I didn’t talk to her specifically about the wait but I think she’s just excited and hopes that they have a lot of good quality men for her when she does get there.’
This comes after Clare seemed to slam one of the contestants competing for her heart – Matt James!
As you may know, he is Tyler Cameron‘s best friend who also runs the ABC Food Tours charity.
That being said, during an interview in which he was promoting the charity, he also opened up about Clare and what he thought about her, something she was seemingly not too happy about.
While she never mentioned his name, her tweet that followed really seemed to be a reaction to his interview.
It reads: ‘If you are doing interviews and creating Cameo accounts before you are even on my season. You are in it for the wrong reasons… #dontwasteyourtime.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Normal People Finale Recap: Will They or Won’t They?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Connell and Marianne are in a groove. Marianne is “content,” happy to do movie nights with Joanna and not even all that rattled by the fact that her mom has decided to stop supporting her (financially, that is — she was never really supporting Marianne emotionally). Marianne has to move out of that glamorous Dublin flat. She’s all but estranged from her family now, but she’s building this life for herself on her own terms. And I don’t think that’s not a factor in why she and Connell are able to be in such a good place. This, after all, is their comfort zone: He’s the dominant one, the one with all the power, and she is the one who needs him. It’s telling that even though she had all the resources in the world back when Connell lost his restaurant gig and couldn’t make rent, he could not bring himself to ask her if he could stay with her, but now that the roles are reversed — even though they both won that scholarship so doesn’t Marianne also have free housing? — it’s a given that she will stay with him, so he can take care of her.
The cool girl from first year who cornered Connell about his Joyce essay successfully got him involved in the literary magazine, which he edits. He’s written a story so great Marianne is “completely jealous” of it. He’s buying Marianne a book of Frank O’Hara poetry for her appropriately low-key and lovely birthday, for which she curled her hair and put on lipstick, like someone who is excited about life again. 
From what we can see of their sex life now, it’s all very intimate and heavy-breathy and not at all violent, even in a playful way, which would suggest Marianne just put that whole part of herself in a little box to never open again, which I’m sure will be fine! She takes all that energy to the pool to swim laps multiple times a day.
All is well and calm and good and then: Connell gets an email. A university in New York (!) is offering him a place in their creative writing MFA program. Marianne is stunned; she didn’t even know he applied. She expresses her shock before she says “congratulations” which is not ideal but is understandable, considering. Connell is super-embarrassed about the whole thing, which was a long shot. Why didn’t he tell Marianne he was applying? “To be honest, I still look up to you a lot and I wouldn’t want you to see me as deluded.” Aww! Of course it wasn’t even Connell’s idea to apply because Connell, like Marianne, is constitutionally incapable of really taking his life into his own hands and pretty much every major decision to date — applying to Trinity, studying English, going to therapy, joining the literary magazine — was made for him by someone else who had to talk him into it. 
The show does a much better job than the book did of letting us see Connell really addressing his mental health issues. (For one thing, the therapy in the book was a bust and didn’t really take.) Connell is concerned about uprooting his barely stable life, one that is only recently free of panic attacks. “Now is not the time for me to go halfway across the world and live in a city where I don’t know anyone,” he says. He swears he’s not going. Marianne advises him to think on it. 
That night, there’s a party for the literary society, where the lovely curly-haired girl kindly calls Connell “the most naturally fucking gifted editor of all times.” There’s punch and joy and I am so relieved Connell and Marianne found these people and aren’t still running around with the Peggys and Jamies of Trinity. 
Connell invites Marianne to his place for Christmas. Well, really it was Lorraine’s idea (see above re: Connell initiating literally anything ever). They drive home with a car piled high with presents and Lorraine greets them as a “Christmas miracle.” I love Lorraine. Their family Christmas is lowkey and sweet and just seeing that such a thing is possible — a happy family, playing silly games, sitting close together and making warm conversation — moves Marianne to tears. She has to retreat just to get some air from the overwhelming niceness of it all. Walking down the street, they pass Marianne’s mom. Lorraine is gracious to her former employer but Marianne’s mom walks away without speaking to them. 
It’s New Year’s Eve, and Marianne agrees to go to the party that all the kids are going to. She wears this semi-sheer pink sparkly top that is halfway to something Helen would wear and a leather skirt that’s very Marianne. Hot, mean Rachel hugs her like they’ve always been friends. I appreciate this bit of realism because I do think for the most part, everyone gets amnesia about who they were dicks to in high school because it’s too mortifying to recall the details, and everybody just does the whole “oh my God, how are you?!” whenever they see someone from home.
In the morning, Connell is helping Marianne move out of her mom’s house for real. Site of their first kiss but otherwise not really a place Marianne is too keen on remembering. They’ve both been thinking about New York. Connell would love for one year of his life to not be so hard, but Marianne points out that there is more than one way for your life to be difficult, and what if New York is “difficult and amazing”? (I love how she says “It’s New York! It’s writing!” Shh … protect their Irish innocence, no one tell them what it’s really like.) 
After Connell comes around to/admits that he would like to go, Marianne confesses that she is going to stay put. “I want to live the life I’m living,” she says. It’s only for a year. Well, in theory it’s only for a year. Maybe Connell will love New York and never want to come back to this place. They have this very tender back and forth about how they wouldn’t be the people they are now without each other. “We have done so much good for one another,” she tells him. He says “I’ll go” and she says “And I’ll stay, and we’ll be okay.” 
Ah, the first young couple in the history of coupledom to attempt a long distance relationship. Can they really handle being apart? Or will they be so good at being apart they never get back together? Share your most romantic and/or cruel theories in the comments!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MUMBAI: Actor Irrfan Khan's son Babil has posted a video of the late actor indulging in pani puri after a shoot.
"When you're on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani puri," Babil captioned the video posted on Instagram.
Irrfan breathed his last early on Wednesday at the age of 54. He was admitted to Mumbai's Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital with a colon infection earlier this week. The actor is survived by his wife Sutapa Sikdar and two sons Babil and Ayan.
Following his death, Babil took to Instagram to express gratitude towards everyone for sending their condolences.
"I'm deeply grateful for all the condolences you beautiful friends are pouring in for me. Although, I hope you understand that right now I'm no being able to reply because my vocabulary is dizzy," he wrote.
"I will get back to each one of you but just not right now. Thank you so much! I love you," he added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan Khan left a gaping hole in not just Bollywood, but in world cinema as a whole! While fans were shattered when news broke out of the Maqbool actor passing away, it was his family who mourns the most. While the late actor’s wife
wrote an emotional letter on the actor’s demise, his son Babil too shared his heartfelt condolences.
But today, Babil has taken to his social media handle to share yet another post of his father and the veteran Irrfan Khan. While Khan looks content in the video as he relishes Pani Puri at a fancy restaurant, we can’t stop our tears from flowing.
Babil took to his Instagram handle to share the video with a caption that read, “When you’re on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani puri.”
Fans of Irrfan Khan are however heartbroken as they see this video with some of the commenting,” For a second mujhe laga jaise he is there. Kuch hua hi na ho (feels like nothing ever happened). Love and power to sutapa ji, you and Ayan.”
Meanwhile, Babil also took to his social media handle to thank all the fans of the late Irrfan Khan for their prayers and condolences. He wrote on his Instagram story, “I’m deeply grateful for all the condolences you beautiful friends are pouring in for me. Although I hope you understand that right now I’m not being able to reply because my vocabolary is dizzy. I will get back to each one of you but just not right now. Thank you so much. I love you.”
Irrfan Khan had a long and painful battle against cancer to which he eventually succumbed yesterday at the Kokilaben Ambani hospital, where he was admitted for a colon infection.
On the professional front, Irrfan Khan was last seen in Angrezi Medium alongside Kareena Kapoor Khan, Deepak Dobriyal, Radhika Madan, and Dimple Kapadia in pivotal roles. The Indian Cinema gem was one of the few actors to be a part of several Oscar-winning films.
Our heart reaches out to Irrfan Khan’s family and may God bless them with strength and courage to deal with these difficult days.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fans turn emotional as Irrfan Khan's son Babil shares an unseen video of the actor enjoying pani-puri</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan Khan’s son Babil posted an unseen video of his father enjoying pani-puri at a restaurant and fans soon started missing the legendary actor. Irrfan was captured enjoying a hearty meal in the video which Babil had captioned, “When you’re on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani puri.” Fans of the actor flooded the post with emotional comments, expressing grief and strength to the late actor’s family.
Irrfan Khan passed away on Wednesday after a battle with neuroendocrine cancer for over two years. In a gratitude note, the actor’s wife Sutapa expressed that it was not a loss but a gain of the things that he taught them. She shared, “How can I write this as a family statement when the whole world is taking it as a personal loss? How can I begin to feel alone when millions are grieving with us at the moment? I want to assure everyone that this is not a loss, it is a gain. It’s a gain of the things he taught us, and now we shall finally begin to truly implement it and evolve. Yet I want to try to fill in the things that people don’t already know. Funnily, our life was a masterclass in acting, so when the dramatic entry of the ‘uninvited guests’ happened, I had by then learnt, to see a harmony in the cacophony. The doctor’s reports were like scripts which I wanted to perfect, so I never miss any detail that he sought for in his performance. We met some amazing people in this journey and the list is endless, but there are some whom I have to mention, our oncologist Dr. Nitesh Rohtogi (Max hospital Saket) who held our hand in the beginning, Dr. Dan Krell (UK), Dr. Shidravi (UK), my heartbeat and my lantern in the dark Dr. Sevanti Limaye (Kokilaben hospital).”
“I see my little family, in a boat, with both my sons Babil and Ayaan, paddling it forward, with Irrfan guiding them ‘wahan nahi, yahan se modo’ but since life is not cinema and there are no retakes, I sincerely wish my children sail this boat safely with their father’s guidance in mind and rockabye through the storm,” Sutapa added in the note.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reverend Richard Coles makes emotional radio tribute to sister-in-law who died from coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reverend Richard Coles has paid an emotional radio tribute to his sister-in-law who died on Thursday after contracting coronavirus.
The former Strictly Come Dancing star announced on Instagram earlier this week that Louise had died in hospital as he shared a picture of them smiling together.
Today Richard, 58, spoke about the strength of love and the importance of social distancing as he spoke about the death of Louise, who was married to his brother Andy.
Richard, whose civil partner David also died in December last year, explained Louise received treatment for cancer after being diagnosed earlier this year.
He told BBC Radio Four : "She (Louise) felt unwell over Christmas, a doggedly persistent winter cold she thought, but it was cancer.
"So aggressive was her treatment it left her unprotected. In spite of the most meticulous efforts to shield her from the virus, it breached her defences.
"Louise and Andy had planned how this would go. They knew once she was admitted they could not be together but they were inseparable having found in one another the unequalled compliment a lifetime search that viruses can't touch.
"Love is as strong as death and cannot be quenched."
He also emphasised the same message as the Queen did last month when she addressed the nation by saying: 'We'll meet again.'
Reverend Coles told how Louise had retired from her role of head of sixth form at a school after 17 years, and read out tributes from former pupils.
When the reverend took to social media to pay tribute to Louise on Thursday, he wrote alongside the snap of the pair together: "My lovely sister in law @lozaamandine died this afternoon with COVID19.
"She made lots of people very happy, not least @RevDavidColes, with whom she went on extravagant and unauthorised expeditions to her beloved North Africa.
"RIP, darling woman."
His brother Andy also shared a tribute, saying: "I am very sorry to have to report the death of my wife Louise this afternoon.
"She had been unwell for some time with cancer, but caught coronavirus even while shielding.
"Thankfully we had time to prepare, but this was too soon."
Richard announced David's death last year from a long-term illness.
At the time, he penned: "I'm very sorry to say that @RevDavidColes has died.
"He had been ill for a while. Thanks to the brilliant teams who looked after him @KettGeneral. Funeral details to follow."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reverend Richard Coles shares tribute after sister-in-law dies from coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reverend Richard Coles has paid tribute to his sister-in-law following her death to coronavirus at the age of 58.
Louise Coles, who was married to Richard’s brother Andy, passed away on Wednesday after she had contracted Covid-19.
Richard has now shared a touching tribute to the former teacher and Conservative councillor at Peterborough City Council, saying they ‘will meet again’.
He also stated she had been diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, and had been receiving treatment for it.
Speaking in a special piece for BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: ‘She felt unwell over Christmas, a doggedly persistent winter cold she thought, but it was cancer.
‘So aggressive was her treatment it left her unprotected. In spite of the most meticulous efforts to shield her from the virus, it breached her defences.
‘Louise and Andy had planned how this would go. They knew once she was admitted they could not be together but they were inseparable having found in one another the unequalled compliment a lifetime search that viruses can’t touch.’
He concluded: ‘Love is as strong as death and cannot be quenched. We’ll meet again.’
During his monologue, the Strictly Come Dancing star also urged the public to continue practicing social distancing measures while in lockdown.
Earlier this week, Richard had shared the sad news of Louise’s death on Twitter, posting a picture of her with his late partner Reverend David Coles, who passed away last December following a long illness.
‘My lovely sister in law @lozaamandine died this afternoon with Covid-19,’ he wrote.
‘She made lots of people very happy, not least @RevDavidCole, with whom she went on extravagant and unauthorised expeditions to her beloved North Africa.’
He added: ‘RIP, darling woman.’
Louise’s husband Andy, Peterborough City Councillor for Fletton and Woodston Ward, had previously confirmed that his wife had passed away due to coronavirus.
He tweeted: ‘I am sorry to report my dearly beloved wife and fellow councillor, Louise, died this afternoon from coronavirus.
‘The wonderful NHS staff at ward B12 in PCH had been doing everything to treat her, but her underlying lung cancer diagnosis made their work so much more difficult.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Quebec fashion designer Mathieu Caron launches line of masks inspired by Olympic skaters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONTREAL - A Quebec fashion designer has launched a limited edition of high-end designer masks inspired by the costumes of professional figure skaters he typically dresses.
Mathieu Caron has been designing and manufacturing outfits for several years including the spectacular outfits worn by Canadian Olympic champ Tessa Virtue and world silver medallist Shoma Uno of Japan, among others.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, that material is being used to create designer masks — with profits going to the World Health Organization.
"We took the same materials as the skaters' costumes, the same decorations, the same design, but we completely recreated the form to make masks," said Caron, a Longueuil, Que.-based skatewear, dancewear, gown and wedding dress designer.
"My primary goal was to make sure that the artistic side could come to help a little, raise funds to make a difference and at the same time make a collection item a little more glamorous than a ordinary mask."
The unique masks are not for all budgets — with the eight models costing between $150 and $300.
It hasn't stymied interest in the masks. Japanese customers snatched up the items inspired by Uno's costumes, which retailed for $200 to $250.
"I was surprised," Caron admitted. "In times of crisis like this, I honestly didn't think people had so much money to buy a mask."
Caron said at the beginning, the idea was to design a maximum of 15 masks for each skater, but in Japan, they sold 70.
In three hours, 245 masks were sold, giving birth to the hashtag #Shomask in Japan, with stocks of the three models flying off the shelves.
When the items were first made available, a few masks were ready to ship. But given the demand, Caron had to move quickly to fill orders.
The goal wasn't a big marketing campaign, Caron said.
"It was more an artistic contribution to do our part with some members of my team who also got involved in the decoration," Caron said. "But with everything we have sold, we will not be unemployed for the next few weeks."
The fabrics come from the same materials as the skaters' outfits and are very breathable material, with padding included to give them shape and structure.
The masks are made of cotton and polyester fibres.
"Now, is it something medical? Not at all," Caron said. "We would rather call it a fashion accessory, a collector's item."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The year that was: Shari Sebbens brings it all home</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This was Shari Sebbens’ year.
The 35-year-old, best known outside the theatre for the hit movie The Sapphires and roles in TV shows such as The Heights, is Sydney Theatre Company’s current Richard Wherrett fellow. She's also been getting great notices for her work in high-profile productions including Black Is The New White; was about to embark on her directorial debut with STC’s The 7 Stages of Grieving; and had been selected to travel to Los Angeles to take part in a five-day Indigenous talent incubator program.
Then came COVID-19 and for Sebbens – and every other actor in Australia – it all came to a screeching halt.
But in spite of everything, she remains positive and upbeat and – judging by her frequent raucous laughter – has kept her sense of humour.
“I’ve got faith that it’ll all pick up again so I’m sort of enjoying the quiet time,” she says. “It’s weird, but, for an actor, I have a bit of an introverted side so burying myself into a little hole and pretending the rest of the world doesn’t exist is kind of novel for me.”
However, as for the rest of us, virus-enforced lockdown does have its limits.
“I have just started to reach the cabin-fever stage,” she says. “I’ve been stressing my housemates out a bit with my erratic behaviour – trying to entertain myself and entertain them but being more annoying than anything!”
This week would have seen the start of rehearsals for The 7 Stages of Grieving, Wesley Enoch and Deborah Mailman’s ground-breaking 1995 one-woman play.
The STC show has been postponed until “who knows when” but Sebbens is continuing work on the production from home.
“There are a lot of elements of the show that we can still work on,” she says. “We had a great design meeting today. It’s a bit of a blessing, I guess, to have some more time to work on things. It has been really interesting watching the theatre community adapt to new ways of collaborating and working together.”
She’s also continuing work on Superheroes, which she is directing and is due to open with Griffin Theatre Company in November.
“It’s hard to say, but at the moment we are carrying on like it’s going to happen,” she says. “I’m crossing everything and hoping for the best outcome.”
Meantime, along with colleagues including Tim Minchin, Yael Stone and Kate Mulvany, Sebbens is filming short videos from home for a new STC Virtual series.
So far, she has tackled excerpts from Black Is The New White, The 7 Stages Of Grieving, Stolen and, most recently, a hilarious cameo from Blackie Blackie Brown with Ash Flanders.
"It's kind of cool just seeing what we can get away with. We don’t actually have to treat it with the same reverence. We can be a bit more lo-fi and have more fun with it. The pretence is gone because we're sitting in our rooms, looking through a phone screen.”
She’s been getting plenty of positive responses to the whimsical videos, including some less directly focused on her performance.
“I’ve had a lot of comments about my spice rack,” she laughs. “I can’t even take credit for it. It’s actually my housemates’ but they have made me look like a very professional home cook."

“It’s hard to say, but at the moment we are carrying on like it’s going to happen,” she says. “I’m crossing everything and hoping for the best outcome.”
Meantime, along with colleagues including Tim Minchin, Yael Stone and Kate Mulvany, Sebbens is filming short videos from home for a new STC Virtual series.
So far, she has tackled excerpts from Black Is The New White, The 7 Stages Of Grieving, Stolen and, most recently, a hilarious cameo from Blackie Blackie Brown with Ash Flanders.
"It's kind of cool just seeing what we can get away with. We don’t actually have to treat it with the same reverence. We can be a bit more lo-fi and have more fun with it. The pretence is gone because we're sitting in our rooms, looking through a phone screen.”
She’s been getting plenty of positive responses to the whimsical videos, including some less directly focused on her performance.
“I’ve had a lot of comments about my spice rack,” she laughs. “I can’t even take credit for it. It’s actually my housemates’ but they have made me look like a very professional home cook."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The year that was: Shari Sebbens brings it all home</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This was Shari Sebbens’ year.
The 35-year-old, best known outside the theatre for the hit movie The Sapphires and roles in TV shows such as The Heights, is Sydney Theatre Company’s current Richard Wherrett fellow. She's also been getting great notices for her work in high-profile productions including Black Is The New White; was about to embark on her directorial debut with STC’s The 7 Stages of Grieving; and had been selected to travel to Los Angeles to take part in a five-day Indigenous talent incubator program.
Then came COVID-19 and for Sebbens – and every other actor in Australia – it all came to a screeching halt.
But in spite of everything, she remains positive and upbeat and – judging by her frequent raucous laughter – has kept her sense of humour.
“I’ve got faith that it’ll all pick up again so I’m sort of enjoying the quiet time,” she says. “It’s weird, but, for an actor, I have a bit of an introverted side so burying myself into a little hole and pretending the rest of the world doesn’t exist is kind of novel for me.”
However, as for the rest of us, virus-enforced lockdown does have its limits.
“I have just started to reach the cabin-fever stage,” she says. “I’ve been stressing my housemates out a bit with my erratic behaviour – trying to entertain myself and entertain them but being more annoying than anything!”
This week would have seen the start of rehearsals for The 7 Stages of Grieving, Wesley Enoch and Deborah Mailman’s ground-breaking 1995 one-woman play.
The STC show has been postponed until “who knows when” but Sebbens is continuing work on the production from home.
“There are a lot of elements of the show that we can still work on,” she says. “We had a great design meeting today. It’s a bit of a blessing, I guess, to have some more time to work on things. It has been really interesting watching the theatre community adapt to new ways of collaborating and working together.”
She’s also continuing work on Superheroes, which she is directing and is due to open with Griffin Theatre Company in November.
“It’s hard to say, but at the moment we are carrying on like it’s going to happen,” she says. “I’m crossing everything and hoping for the best outcome.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The youngest ever winner of 'RuPaul's Drag Race' tells us how drag has gone virtual — and how the disrupted current season's finale should work</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aquaria, the first Gen Z winner of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” is in her house.
For a drag queen, that’s unusual. Many queens derive their primary income from performing at bars and stages all over the world – and from the fans who show up to tip them.
But, like millions around the world, drag queens are sheltering in place during the coronavirus pandemic.
“We’ve really had no other option than to resort to going back to the old days,” Aquaria told Business Insider, “where a lot of us started being little internet queens, and just doing our makeup and honing our craft at home.”
Drag shows around the world have moved online. As Rolling Stone reported, queens have taken to platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and even Instagram Live to keep the party going – and attempt to recoup some lost income.
“I have a lot of privilege and a lot less stress – in theory – when it comes to putting these things together, and getting my [Instagram] Lives and my streams publicized,” Aquaria said.
But she noted that that’s not necessarily the case for local entertainers. Many may have huge followings in their hometowns, but translating that to a global audience – and recouping the tips they would have received from local fans – is a difficult task.
Aquaria, along with a roster of fellow “Drag Race” stars, has been competing in “Werq The World Battle Royale.” It’s a livestream of the self-described “largest drag show on the planet” – and, according to its website, all funds raised go to “displaced local drag entertainers around the globe.” The queens go head to head in runway themes chosen by fans. On May 2, Aquaria will showcase her best interpretation of “Human Touch.”
Battle Royale features one competitor from the current season of “Drag Race” – fan-favourite and frontrunner Gigi Goode. And that reflects a major difference in how season 12’s queens will experience life post-“Drag Race.”
As a season of “Drag Race” airs, queens competing in that season often host viewing parties at gay bars. Fans get to watch the queen offer meta-commentary alongside an episode they compete in, and the queens get a chance to perform in front of excited fans.
“Drag Race” also crowns a winner live; while the finale is prerecorded, every finalist films a segment of them winning. The actual ending is aired in real time, and queens learn their fate alongside the audience – one famous example is a reaction video of Sasha Velour watching herself win season 9.
“Those [viewing parties] were very special moments for me,” Aquaria said. “Getting to share my experiences on ‘Drag Race’ with a group of happy-go-lucky LGBTQ people in a safe space.”
But the queens currently competing on season 12, which began airing weekly on February 28, won’t get any of those experiences because of coronavirus shutdowns.
They also won’t get the post-season visibility – and monetary opportunities – that other competitors have benefited from.
“I was lucky enough to have an unnecessary amount of work while my season was airing and once I’d won,” Aquaria said. “So, that was something that I was extremely grateful for back in the day. And it’s really hard to see that the season 12 girls are not able to really do much as far as work, no matter how hard they want to try.”
But she said that fans have stepped up to try and (virtually) fill that void as much as they can for the current competitors.
“I don’t know if it’s just ’cause I’m online, but I think every day I see so many posts and things shared that are just trying to uplift these girls,” Aquaria said. “Because if they can’t build their fan base and their notoriety on the stage, and in person at the club, we might as well make them internet superstars for the time being.”
And this season – which has already had to contend with the disqualification of contestant Sherry Pie following explosive catfishing allegations – now faces an uncertain finale. Finale episodes are generally recorded a few weeks before airing, which means that, in a non-coronavirus world, a live studio audience would be packing the seats at an LA venue relatively soon.
The show hasn’t made any announcement yet about how the finale will be handled; Aquaria personally believes “some sort of digital version of that would not be acceptable.” She said that potentially delaying the finale – and keeping everyone “on the edge of our seats” – would be a preferable alternative.
“I think the show and the queens and the fans and the world would reap a lot more benefit if we were able to celebrate in the future than if we were supposed to, you know, cheer for 20 minutes sometime next month and then move on from there,” Aquaria said.
For now, drag queens all over the world are still figuring out what their art looks like during this pandemic, from Zoom to Houseparty. But throughout it all, there’s been one constant.
“It’s wild to see people who will grab a cocktail, tune in at 9:00 PM on a Saturday night, and make believe that they’re at a drag show. It’s certainly an extremely surreal time,” Aquaria said. “I know I can definitely speak for any drag entertainer who’s been trying to make do with this to say how challenging it’s been, how interesting it’s been to see how we all adapt and how it is really pushing us to work in a different creative way. And, most importantly, how extremely grateful we all are for the fans who are out there, paying to see these live streams, tipping constantly, and always showing their support.”

Drag shows around the world have moved online. As Rolling Stone reported, queens have taken to platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and even Instagram Live to keep the party going – and attempt to recoup some lost income.
“I have a lot of privilege and a lot less stress – in theory – when it comes to putting these things together, and getting my [Instagram] Lives and my streams publicized,” Aquaria said.
But she noted that that’s not necessarily the case for local entertainers. Many may have huge followings in their hometowns, but translating that to a global audience – and recouping the tips they would have received from local fans – is a difficult task.
Aquaria, along with a roster of fellow “Drag Race” stars, has been competing in “Werq The World Battle Royale.” It’s a livestream of the self-described “largest drag show on the planet” – and, according to its website, all funds raised go to “displaced local drag entertainers around the globe.” The queens go head to head in runway themes chosen by fans. On May 2, Aquaria will showcase her best interpretation of “Human Touch.”
Battle Royale features one competitor from the current season of “Drag Race” – fan-favorite and frontrunner Gigi Goode. And that reflects a major difference in how season 12’s queens will experience life post-“Drag Race.”
As a season of “Drag Race” airs, queens competing in that season often host viewing parties at gay bars. Fans get to watch the queen offer meta-commentary alongside an episode they compete in, and the queens get a chance to perform in front of excited fans.
“Drag Race” also crowns a winner live; while the finale is prerecorded, every finalist films a segment of them winning. The actual ending is aired in real time, and queens learn their fate alongside the audience – one famous example is a reaction video of Sasha Velour watching herself win season 9.
“Those [viewing parties] were very special moments for me,” Aquaria said. “Getting to share my experiences on ‘Drag Race’ with a group of happy-go-lucky LGBTQ people in a safe space.”
But the queens currently competing on season 12, which began airing weekly on February 28, won’t get any of those experiences because of coronavirus shutdowns.
They also won’t get the post-season visibility – and monetary opportunities – that other competitors have benefited from.
“I was lucky enough to have an unnecessary amount of work while my season was airing and once I’d won,” Aquaria said. “So, that was something that I was extremely grateful for back in the day. And it’s really hard to see that the season 12 girls are not able to really do much as far as work, no matter how hard they want to try.”
But she said that fans have stepped up to try and (virtually) fill that void as much as they can for the current competitors.
“I don’t know if it’s just ’cause I’m online, but I think every day I see so many posts and things shared that are just trying to uplift these girls,” Aquaria said. “Because if they can’t build their fan base and their notoriety on the stage, and in person at the club, we might as well make them internet superstars for the time being.”
And this season – which has already had to contend with the disqualification of contestant Sherry Pie following explosive catfishing allegations – now faces an uncertain finale. Finale episodes are generally recorded a few weeks before airing, which means that, in a non-coronavirus world, a live studio audience would be packing the seats at an LA venue relatively soon.
The show hasn’t made any announcement yet about how the finale will be handled; Aquaria personally believes “some sort of digital version of that would not be acceptable.” She said that potentially delaying the finale – and keeping everyone “on the edge of our seats” – would be a preferable alternative.
“I think the show and the queens and the fans and the world would reap a lot more benefit if we were able to celebrate in the future than if we were supposed to, you know, cheer for 20 minutes sometime next month and then move on from there,” Aquaria said.
For now, drag queens all over the world are still figuring out what their art looks like during this pandemic, from Zoom to Houseparty. But throughout it all, there’s been one constant.
“It’s wild to see people who will grab a cocktail, tune in at 9:00 PM on a Saturday night, and make believe that they’re at a drag show. It’s certainly an extremely surreal time,” Aquaria said. “I know I can definitely speak for any drag entertainer who’s been trying to make do with this to say how challenging it’s been, how interesting it’s been to see how we all adapt and how it is really pushing us to work in a different creative way. And, most importantly, how extremely grateful we all are for the fans who are out there, paying to see these live streams, tipping constantly, and always showing their support.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amanda Holden's sleek new hair transformation blows BGT fans away</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Enthralled viewers could not get enough of a sensational new hairdo for Amanda Holden during last night's BGT (Saturday May 2).
She was right in the thick of the episode's action as she pressed her Golden Buzzer for a mum and daughter singing act.
But while those watching at home were split over Honey and Sammy, the verdict on Amanda's hair transformation was clear.
Her glossy bob was a hit with fans - with many expressing on social media she should stick with the cut.

"@AmandaHolden hair is lush short #bgt," observed one Twitter user.
"Love Amanda Holden hair #BGT @AmandaHolden," tweeted another.
A third echoed: "@AmandaHolden love your hair on BGT tonight x."
And a fourth added: "@AmandaHolden I've got to say I do love your hair in the straight sleek bob."

"@AmandaHolden Keep your hair short it really really suits you #BGT," suggested yet another impressed onlooker.
Others suggested the 49-year-old judge's look would be their 'dream' - and looked so immaculate they could barely believe it was real!
"IMAGINE being able to pull @AmandaHolden hair style off tho! Would be my dreammmmm #bgt," gushed one fan.
And another chipped in: "@AmandaHolden not being rude (I know I sound it) but your hair looks so glossy it looks synthetic!! Is it a wig?? Xx."
Similarly, another person asked for advice on behalf of an ill relative.
They wrote: "@AmandaHolden my mum loves your hair tonight on BGT!! What wigs do you use? She’s currently going through a hard time at the moment after losing her hair due to fighting cancer for a second time. #staysafe #BGT."
Amanda joked she was emulating another social media icon as she showed off her perfect locks on Instagram earlier this year as auditions were filmed.
She captioned the bombshell image: "@bgt look 2 channelling my inner @khloekardashian."
"No Kardashian has anything on you, my lovely," one supporter commented on the pic at the time.
And another person raved: "I don’t think there’s anyone more beautiful."
Some fans were slightly more critical of last night's BGT, however.
They accused the show of being a 'set up' following Honey and Sammy's successful tryout.
Following a false start with the judges, the act particularly impressed Amanda following a performance of Freya Ridings' Lost Without You.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Curtis Pritchard gets butt naked to celebrate national gardening day</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Love Island star Curtis Pritchard apparently has a lot of love for gardening after posing butt naked to celebrate the national appreciation day. 
The 24-year-old was in a cheeky mood on Saturday (2 May) and shared a photo of himself standing completely naked with his back towards the camera, wearing only a pair of gloves and boots. 
‘HAPPY INTERNATIONAL NAKED GARDENING DAY !’ he simply captioned the image, and it was enough to have his followers lusting and thirsty. 
His The Greatest Dancer co-star Todrick Hall didn’t hold back his admiration and commented: ‘Hallelujah! Praise god for the screenshot I just took! My new background on my phone!’ 
Clearly one picture wasn’t enough for another of Curtis’ followers, who demanded: ‘Curtis Prichard we need a callander from you [sic].’ 
Posing a very valid question, an inquisitive fan wondered: ‘Who was the lucky camera man.’ 
‘Saturday night just got a whole lot better,’ one admirer admitted, while others pleaded for Curtis to ‘turn around’. 
Let’s keep it PG, folks. 
It’s likely the cameraman was Curtis’ older brother AJ Pritchard as the dancers are in quarantine together at their family home alongside their parents. 
No doubt Curtis appreciated the compliments from his admirers after finding himself single again following his split from girlfriend Maura Higgins. 
The pair found love on last summer’s series of Love Island but split in March after struggling to find time to spend together.
Curtis recently addressed the scrutiny surrounding Maura’s friendship with her Dancing On Ice co-star Alex Demetriou. 
He previously told The Sun: ‘It’s not nice to read about. 
‘I have no proof that ­anything more has ­happened between them. I don’t like to think about it. I don’t want to look back over the past few months for warning signs. But it’s not nice to read about her relationship with Alex and to see pictures of them together.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jessica Simpson, 39, looks happier than ever! The blonde beauty took to Instagram while in lockdown with her family to share a snap of herself and one-year-old daughter Birdie enjoying their time in the sun. Jess posted the black and white snap on May 2, with the caption, “I think I now have that kid Saturday happy kind of feeling all over again! No school for 2 whole days!!! #BIRDIEMAE.” The Dukes of Hazard star rocked a bikini top and oversized sunglasses, as she pulled her hair into a high ponytail.
Fans were quick to comment on how incredible Jess looked in the snap, in which she wore a massive smile on her face. “You look amazing,” one fan wrote, while another commented, “Beautiful baby and mommy.” It comes just days after the Open Book author shared a pic on Instagram that showed her lounging in an infinity pool while in self isolation. In the snap she wore a tiny bikini that showed off her enviable figure.
“Attempted gettin’ some sun and my son smacked a home run from the driveway that almost nailed me in the face. Proof is in the splash. Needless to say, I got off the mat,” the mother of three wrote, adding a laughing emoji. Her fans loved how relatable the moment was. You know, aside from the relaxing in a luxurious pool part. Most of the United States has been under some form of quarantine during the coronavirus crisis, and kids being home full-time from school definitely has its difficulties. It’s important to have some alone time every once in awhile!
The fashion designer isn’t sweating any of the small stuff right now. After ex-boyfriend John Mayer talked about her memoir (which says some less than flattering things about him) on Watch What Happens Live, a source told HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY that she, frankly, doesn’t care. “That’s so in the past for her and she’s very happy with the life she leads now,” they said. “Of course, she knew that he would maybe read it or at the very least hear about it, but she told her side of the story and truth and that’s what this book was about to her.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRITAIN's Got Talent's Amanda Holden sent fans wild tonight with her sizzling look and glossy bob.
The 49-year-old turned heads for all the right reasons at the Britain's Got Talentauditions as she showed off her bob hair cut - and appeared to go bra-free. 
The mum-of-two drove her fans wild and stole the spotlight on the panel with her preened look, that included a striking hair do and sexy sheer dress.
Viewers loved her glam attire and one said: "I do like Amanda's hair #BGT really suits her."
Another raved: "Amanda with that short hair and black dress... it's a YES from me!"
One more tweeted: "Love Amanda Holdens hair"
 
Other fans couldn't take their eyes off her figure in her black dress that hugged her body and featured shoulder pads.
Amanda got emotional watching mother and daughter Honey and Sammy duet on stage
When she got up to give the act a hug she revealed the back of her racy frock.
One fan said: "Think Amanda forgot her bra!"
Amanda showed off the look back in January on Instagram and said she was inspired by Khloe Kardashian.
She wrote: "@bgt look 2 channelling my inner @khloekardashian."
The 48-year-old wore a sleeveless black dress with a sheer panel that showed off her toned arms.
Amanda stunned as she hit the panel today alongside co-stars David Walliams, Alesha Dixon and Simon Cowell.
Fans could not get enough of her look with one commenting: "Stunning. Looked fab at BGT."
Another said: "Witwoo Ms Holden."
While a third gushed: "Wow amazing Amanda, the hair."
Meanwhile BGT fans have been left shocked by Amanda’s lips this series, which look bigger than ever.
She shared a close up of her face all glammed-up after filming for the new series – and her followers couldn’t resist commenting on her pout.
One person wrote: “Your lips have grown.”
Another added:  “See you’ve had you lips done!!”
While a third said:  “Lips done.”
Although the judge has raved about Botox in the past she has always claimed she's never had her lips done, despite them changing a fair bit over the years.
She has previously denied having any work done on them and said: “With age, your lips thin up – I felt like telling people to come round and check them out themselves, you can see they’ve not been done.”
She insisted: “I’d never have my lips plumped, that’s the one thing I wouldn’t have done.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jesy Nelson dons a beard for clip and fans reckon she still looks hot with bristles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Little Mix star Jesy Nelson has proved she still looks hot even when she's sporting a BEARD.
Jesy transformed herself into an electrician named Gary and wore fake facial hear for funny sketch which she shared on Instagram to her 6.7m fans.
The singer, 28, lay on her bed wearing a skimpy crop top and silk pyjama bottoms, alongside her pal Charlotte who was posing as a plumber named Steve.
And the stunner's Insta fans were very impressed with her new look - with many rushing to the comments section to tell her she looked 'hot'.
One wrote: "Still Gorgeous @jesynelson."
Another gushed: "Still would."
A third added: "Now i love you more."
Many of Jesy's followers also praised her for posting the clip and said it had them 'cracking up'.
The pair told how they were called 'Sparky Boiz' while bigging up their handyman services.
Jesy said: "What's Going on everyone, Gary here, just thought I'd do a quick post cos me and my mate Steve are still working in lockdaaan."
Jesy has been keeping her fans entertained Instagram posts during lockdown.
Earlier this week she posted a snap of her in a very scanty outfit as she headed to Sainsbury's.
Her jeans were unzipped when she made her journey to the supermarket giant amid the coronavirus outbreak.
Quickly stopping for a photoshoot before her shop, Jesy worked all her best angles for the camera flash.
The newly-single Little Mix star, 28, donned a skimpy handkerchief top with her ripped jeans as she posed up outside her plush front door.
Jesy Nelson sent a clear message to her ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes after their split earlier this month.
The singer, 28, filmed herself dancing around her plush kitchen last week to her band Little Mix's new track Break Up Song in a vido she posted to Instagram.
She passionately sang the lyrics "This is not a second chance, no, no, baby/This is not a new romance, not tonight/This is for all the nights I cried for you, baby."

And the stunner's Insta fans were very impressed with her new look - with many rushing to the comments section to tell her she looked 'hot'.
One wrote: "Still Gorgeous @jesynelson."
Another gushed: "Still would."
A third added: "Now i love you more."
Many of Jesy's followers also praised her for posting the clip and said it had them 'cracking up'.
The pair told how they were called 'Sparky Boiz' while bigging up their handyman services.
Jesy said: "What's Going on everyone, Gary here, just thought I'd do a quick post cos me and my mate Steve are still working in lockdaaan."
Jesy has been keeping her fans entertained Instagram posts during lockdown.
Earlier this week she posted a snap of her in a very scanty outfit as she headed to Sainsbury's.
Her jeans were unzipped when she made her journey to the supermarket giant amid the coronavirus outbreak.
Quickly stopping for a photoshoot before her shop, Jesy worked all her best angles for the camera flash.
The newly-single Little Mix star, 28, donned a skimpy handkerchief top with her ripped jeans as she posed up outside her plush front door.
Jesy Nelson sent a clear message to her ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes after their split earlier this month.
The singer, 28, filmed herself dancing around her plush kitchen last week to her band Little Mix's new track Break Up Song in a vido she posted to Instagram.
She passionately sang the lyrics "This is not a second chance, no, no, baby/This is not a new romance, not tonight/This is for all the nights I cried for you, baby."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger King's Joe Exotic becomes the face of a new fashion line from prison</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tiger King 's Joe Exotic has become the face of a new streetwear collection that features printed images of backstabbing, betrayal and fake friends.
The infamous tiger handler, 57, who is currently serving a 22-year jail sentence, is believed to have hammered out the business details from his jail cell.
According to TMZ, fashion label owner Odain Watson asked Joe to partner with him on a limited collection for the brand Odaingerous.
A contract is "close to being signed" as the two parties agree on the final financial terms.
Odain appears to have confirmed the news on the brand's social media page.
The clothing range, dubbed the 'Revenge' collection, will feature prints of Joe's face as well as references from the Netflix mega-hit series.
One of the staple pieces from the collection is believed to be a print t-shirt that features a leather jacket decorated with tiger stripes.
Joe Exotic and the staff of GW Zoo in Oklahoma were propelled into the spotlight when Netflix released the bizarre Tiger King docuseries on March 20.
According to the streaming giant, over 64 million homes worldwide have tuned in to watch the shocking documentary series.
Full of twists and unusual turns, the documentary details the bitter feud between Joe and his his arch-nemesis Carole Baskin, and also sheds light on the United State's harrowing big cat trade.
The tiger handler - whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage - was eventually sentenced to 22 years in federal prison for a murder for hire plot, falsifying records and a number of animal abuse violations.
Joe has also developed somewhat of a unusual cult following after the series was aired.
Among other products that are now available, fans can buy Joe Exotic condoms and even animal print bikinis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger King's Joe Exotic 'becomes new face of fashion brand' while in jail</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tiger King star Joe Exotic has reportedly become the face of a new fashion collection based on the Netflix docuseries.
The 57-year-old, who is currently serving a 22-year prison sentence for charges including murder-for-hire and animal abuse, is believed to have teamed up with fashion label owner Odain Watson from his jail cell.
TMZ has reported that Odain had asked Joe to partner with him for a limited clothing range for the fashion brand Odaingerous, and a contract is allegedly ‘closed to being signed’ as the two agree on the final financial terms.
The fashion range, which will be called the Revenge collection, includes prints of Joe’s face alongside many Tiger King references.
A t-shirt that features a leather jacket decorated with tiger stripes is set to be one of the many pieces that will be available to be purchased.
Odain appears to have already confirmed the news, as he shared pictures of some of the t-shirts on the Odaingerous Instagram page.
‘Don’t Get Mad Get Even,’ he wrote. ‘@odaingerous presents the #Revenge starring @joe_exotic #joeexotic from @netflix #tigerking coming soon.’
It comes after the UK-based online fashion retailers Missguided and In The Style launched their own Tiger King themed t-shirts.
If that wasn’t enough, there’s also plenty of other merchandise based on the series available to buy, including animal print bikinis and even condoms.
In other news, Kevin Bacon revealed that he would love to play Joe Exotic in a film about the former zoo owner.
Following on from the success of the series, there has been talk of bringing it to the big screen – and Kevin happens to be the bookmakers’ favourite to portray Joe.
During an appearance on the Today show in the US, he said: ‘I’d play Joe Exotic in a second.’
He later added that he had first throught about playing the role after his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, had asked him while he was watching the documentary.
He recalled telling her: ‘This is an amazing show. I said, “The reason that I’m watching the show is because these are the kind of characters I get asked to play.”
‘This is my type of guy, you know, so listen, fingers crossed!’
We are seriously hoping this will happen now.
Metro.co.uk has contacted a rep for Joe Exotic for further comment.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Michelle McGahan
Abigail Ratchford gave her 9.1 million followers some jaw-dropping content on Saturday, May 2, sharing a short Boomerang clip of herself in a barely there bikini that left little to the imagination. The Instagram story post showcased all of the model’s sizzling curves and then some.
Abigail took the selfie video from high above, angling the camera so that it captured the full view of her risqué ensemble. She sat on her knees, green turf underneath her and a white wall beside her. The neutral background — as well as Abigail’s tanned skin — gave the vibrant red of the bathing suit a pop of color.
She looked at the camera with her sea green eyes, tilting her head and opening her mouth, showing off her pearly white teeth. She tugged at one of the straps, giving the video even more sex appeal.
The self-proclaimed “Queen of Curves” wore the watermelon-colored suit, which barely covered her assets. The top featured two triangle cups, which barely contained her voluptuous bust and ample cleavage. Her chest threatened to spill out of the skimpy top. The straps were clear, and disappeared into the model’s sun-kissed skin, making the swimsuit seem even smaller.
Her toned and taut midriff was on full display, her enviable abs shining in the light.
The bikini bottoms were cut dangerously low and were scarcely more than a piece of fabric. Like the straps of the bikini top, the sides of the bathing suit bottoms were see-through as well.
Her long, dark locks didn’t tumble down her shoulders in the clip as per usual; instead, they may have been pulled back.
Abigail squinted her eyes in the sunlight, her dark brows furrowed. She used the “perfect face” Instagram filter for the snapshot, which made her skin even more smooth and gave her slightly rosy cheeks.
The brunette bombshell’s feathery lashes curled upwards in a dramatic fashion. Her lower lashes were coated with black mascara. Her lids shimmered with silver shadow, which also touched the inner corners of her eyes. Her eyes were rimmed with kohl liner. Her cheekbones popped. Her plump pout was lined with mocha liner and filled in with a peachy pink gloss.
As The Inquisitr readers and Abigail Ratchford fans know, the model’s Instagram grid and Instagram story are chock-full of sexy uploads.
One of her most recent posts featured Abigail standing with her back turned to the camera, showing off her derriere in a cheeky, sheer bathrobe that left little to the imagination.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Halle Berry, 53, Strikes A Fierce Pose In A Sheer Lingerie Outfit During A ‘Fitting Flashback’ — Pic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Is Halle Berry, 53, capable of looking less than flawless, like ever? The Oscar winner once again broke the internet when a photo of her rocking a very sexy outfit was posted on Friday, May 1. Fashion stylist Lindsay Flores heated up Instagram when she shared a pic of Halle striking a super fierce pose in a sheer lingerie ensemble. She appeared to go makeup free for the snap with her gorgeous brown locks cascading down both sides of her shoulders. “Ahhhhh the simpler times…,” Lindsay wrote as the caption with the hashtag #fittingflashback, more than likely referring to how things were before the worldwide coronavirus pandemic hit. Naturally the comments section were filled with endless compliments for Halle as fans couldn’t get over how “smoking hot” she looked.
Halle has been one of those A-list stars that has been providing a great distraction for many of us who remain bored in self-isolation. She’s been doing this by uploading a variety of pics that highlight her ageless beauty to perfection. She, along with other actresses like Sarah Michelle Gellar, 44, and Niecy Nash, 50, excelled in the viral #pillowchallenge where people strap a pillow to their body with a belt as a cincher and nothing on underneath.
The mother-of-two also got candid about her love life during an Instagram Live session with Lena Waithe, 35, in mid-April amid romance rumors between her and DJ D-Nice. “I’ve been pretty alone, by myself, going on three years now – decidedly so,” she first revealed before adding, ” I’ve decided to take time [for myself]… I’m going to spend time with me. And it’s been so great that I might stay like this.”
She’s also been using her time in self-isolation to stay in tiptop shape. “I try to catch 10 minutes here and there with the goal of doing at least 30 total minutes of more formal exercise per day,” she explained during an interview with Women’s Health. “I piece together a bunch of little bursts of exercise (many of which I can use my full-body resistance loop and booty band for) to meet my 30-minutes-total goal. In the morning, I try to stretch and do a few rounds of abs moves, like sit-ups or planks, since I usually have some quiet time to myself while the kids eat breakfast.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1, 2020
Sarah Batool Haider
American Playboy model Cassandra Sienega — aka CJ Sparxx — recently took to her Instagram page and wowed her legions of admirers with a very sexy snapshot.
In the picture, which was uploaded to the photo-sharing website on Friday, May 1, Cassandra could be seen rocking a see-through white dress that featured a plunging neckline. As a result, she showed off her never-ending cleavage to tease her fans. That’s not all, but she also flashed a glimpse of her sexy legs. The picture can be viewed on Instagram.
In keeping with her glamorous outfit, Cassandra sported a full face of makeup. The application featured a foundation that gave her face a flawless matte finish. She dusted her cheeks with a light pink blush, applied a nude eyeshadow, a thin coat of mascara, and well-defined, dark eyebrows. She finished off her makeup with a shimmery pink lipstick.
She wore her brunette tresses down and allowed them to fall over her back and shoulders. Meanwhile, she had her perfectly-manicured nails painted with a nude polish.
According to the geotag, the snap was captured in Pasadena, California. For the pic, she sat on the arm of a sofa, spread her legs apart, slightly puckered her lips, and sexily gazed at the camera.
In the caption, Cassandra asked her fans to visit her Only Fans account where she shares her uncensored videos and pictures. She also informed her fans that her sexy outfit was from the Los Angeles-based fashion retailer, Ami Clubwear. In the end, she tagged her photographer Keith from Girls on Glass Studios for acknowledgment.
Within a day of going live, the snap garnered close to 10,000 likes. Meanwhile, some of her most ardent followers also took to the comments sections and posted about 260 messages to praise Cassandra for her sexiness.
“You make me want to do a lot of things girl,” one of her fans commented on the picture.
“Wow!! This pic is on fire! This dress looks super gorgeous on you,” another user chimed in.
“Goddess, I love ur sexy body coz u are perfect and smoking hot. When I look at you, my heart jumps out of my chest,” a third admirer remarked.
“You are absolutely, unbelievably gorgeous! Love you so much,” a fourth follower wrote.
Other users posted words and phrases like “so seductive,” “spectacular,” and “I am speechless,” to express their admiration for Cassandra.
Apart from her fans, the snap was also liked by many other models and influencers, including Olga Loera, Caya Hefner, Khloë Terae, and Jessica Vaugn.
Cassandra loves to show off her sexy body in skimpy outfits from time to time. Only a day ago, she treated her fans to a hot snapshot in which she rocked a revealing crop top teamed with a pair of stretchy shorts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Victoria Beckham posts birthday snaps celebrating David’s big day</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">David could be seen blowing out candles on a cake.
Victoria Beckham has given fans a glimpse of her family’s celebration for husband David’s birthday.
The star turned 45 on Saturday and enjoyed the day with his family at home.
Victoria, 46, who recently reversed her decision to furlough staff at her fashion label, posted a video of David blowing out candles on a cake.
“Happy Birthday David Beckham!! We we love you so, so much,” she wrote.
Their children – apart from Brooklyn Beckham who is in lockdown in the US with his girlfriend – could be heard singing “Happy birthday” with David joking it should be a “bit more upbeat”.
Victoria also posted an old snap of the couple walking their dogs in Manchester.
“Remembering our walks with Snoop and Puffy in Manchester all those years ago.
“Still dog walking together 23 years later. Love you so much,” she said.
Victoria declared David to be the “best daddy” and wrote: “Celebrating in lockdown and missing Brooklyn Beckham and all our friends and family today.”
And she also showed off the personalised wrapping paper containing David’s presents.
“I’m quite obsessed with it,” she said of the paper, featuring his face.
Victoria made a U-turn about furloughing staff at her fashion label following controversy over the decision.

    <h5 class="mb-1">David Beckham celebrates 45th birthday with personalised wrapping paper alongside Victoria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">David Beckham celebrated his 45th birthday by unwrapping gifts that were wrapped with paper sporting his own face.
Wife Victoria posted images on her Instagram of the pair enjoying a bacon sandwich.
She wrote the words "Love you" on the plate using tomato ketchup.
Victoria posted: "Happy birthday to the best daddy. Celebrating in lockdown and missing @brooklynbeckham and all our friends and family today. We all love you so much xxx."
A throwback image of the pair from when they met in 1997 also made it to social media.
Below the image was the caption: "Happy birthday @davidbeckham x Remembering our walks with Snoop and Puffy in Manchester all those years ago. Still dog walking together 23 years later. Love you so much x."
Victoria celebrated her 46th birthday in April with the Beckhams currently isolating at their Cotswolds home.
The birthday messages continued to pour in from the former Manchester United star's various connections.

Current Red Devils man Marcus Rashford said "Happy birthday Becks."
He also posted an image of an old Beckham United shirt which he had got signed by the free-kick specialist back in the day.
It read: "To Marcus. Good luck and continue working hard and playing with joy and passion. Love David Beckham."
After he left United the former England skipper played from Real Madrid, LA Galaxy and AC Milan.
The latter took to their Twitter account to say: "Becks turns 45 today! Happy birthday, David Beckham."
Since retiring from football the London-born star has invested in Salford City alongside his Class of 92 team-mates.
The now football league club were promoted last term thanks to the group's support and the club said: "Happy birthday to David Beckham from everyone at Salford City.
"Have a great day, Becks."

    <h5 class="mb-1">St. Jude music therapists organize backyard jams for kids</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amy Love had to leave the Memphis hospital where she brings music to severely ill children — she and other support staff couldn’t take the risk of spreading COVID-19 to these frail patients.
But she was determined: The music must not stop.
So her house became a recording studio, and Love, fellow music therapist Celeste Douglas and intern Abigail Parrish became video stars for kids at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital who feed on their energy, their melodies, their love.
“Let’s get moving!” Love cries, as she sits cross-legged on a blanket in her backyard.
They play guitars and little drums, shakers and tambourines, and Love’s dog joins in on the fun — even as a lawn-mowing neighbor seems a bit puzzled.
“We’re really excited to be with you today, even if we can’t be there in person,” Douglas tells their early childhood group from afar.
No instruments? No problem. Love urges their viewers: “Just move around with us!”
The familiar tunes they choose to help the kids with fine and gross motor skills, body awareness and other trouble areas they’d usually take on in the hospital include “If You’re Happy and You Know It” and “Old MacDonald Had a Farm.”
For older patients, Love left behind some ukuleles with easy instructions and song selections from Twenty One Pilots and Selena Gomez.
Entertainer Danny Thomas opened the pediatric treatment and research hospital for children with catastrophic diseases in 1962. Care is free for all. Since many of the patients are immune deficient, Love and other support staff are working remotely.
The hospital’s two resident therapy dogs are on hiatus off campus, as well.
“What we’re doing is finding new ways to support our kiddos and keep them safe at the same time,” Love said.
In the hospital, the team holds the early childhood music group once a week for kids up to 3 years old.
“That’s one thing I’ve really missed,” Love said. “We’d all get together and play tons of music and were super loud.”
Switching gears was a bit of a learning curve, she said. Like the ukuleles. Asking kids to teach themselves the instrument could have gone either way, but Love was optimistic.
“It’s a really easy instrument to feel really successful with,” she said. “You can mark up different parts of the ukulele and play it pretty easy. Even with one finger you can be successful and play a chord.”
Love can’t wait for the day she can return to the hospital. In the meantime, she has a mission.
“Music is not canceled,” she said. “We’re going to continue playing music until we can all get back together again.”

While nonstop global news about the effects of the coronavirus have become commonplace, so, too, are the stories about the kindness of strangers and individuals who have sacrificed for others. “One Good Thing” is an Associated Press continuing series reflecting these acts of kindness.

They play guitars and little drums, shakers and tambourines, and Love's dog joins in on the fun — even as a lawn-mowing neighbour seems a bit puzzled.
"We’re really excited to be with you today, even if we can’t be there in person,” Douglas tells their early childhood group from afar.
No instruments? No problem. Love urges their viewers: “Just move around with us!”
The familiar tunes they choose to help the kids with fine and gross motor skills, body awareness and other trouble areas they’d usually take on in the hospital include “If You’re Happy and You Know It” and “Old MacDonald Had a Farm.”
For older patients, Love left behind some ukuleles with easy instructions and song selections from Twenty One Pilots and Selena Gomez.
Entertainer Danny Thomas opened the pediatric treatment and research hospital for children with catastrophic diseases in 1962. Care is free for all. Since many of the patients are immune deficient, Love and other support staff are working remotely.
The hospital's two resident therapy dogs are on hiatus off campus, as well.
“What we’re doing is finding new ways to support our kiddos and keep them safe at the same time," Love said.
In the hospital, the team holds the early childhood music group once a week for kids up to 3 years old.
“That's one thing I've really missed,” Love said. “We'd all get together and play tons of music and were super loud.”
Switching gears was a bit of a learning curve, she said. Like the ukuleles. Asking kids to teach themselves the instrument could have gone either way, but Love was optimistic.
“It's a really easy instrument to feel really successful with," she said. "You can mark up different parts of the ukulele and play it pretty easy. Even with one finger you can be successful and play a chord.”
Love can't wait for the day she can return to the hospital. In the meantime, she has a mission.
“Music is not cancelled,” she said. “We’re going to continue playing music until we can all get back together again.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leaked Rishi Kapoor video from ICU enrages Bollywood</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A leaked video of late actor Rishi Kapoor during his last hours in the ICU has enraged many Bollywood celebrities.
In the video, ICU staff can be seen sneakily recording as the veteran actor struggles.
Several celebrities including Arjun Kapoor, Karan Wahi and Mini Mathur called out the hospital for staff negligence.
Without mentioning the particular leaked video, Arjun wrote: “The choice is not to post something is sometimes as important as to be the first to post something. Images have a lot of power lest we forget. Sometimes humanity and empathy must prevail over being first to embrace use of sly voyeuristic material presented to you.”
Actor Wahi admitted that he too saw the video and decided to delete it immediately, rather than share it among others as he found it disturbing.
Wahi said: “There’s a forward that a ward boy or someone from the hospital has shot of Rishi Kapoor in his hospital just before he passed. I saw it. And think it’s a gross violation of his privacy. If you receive it, delete it rather than forward it further.”
He added: “Actors are also human beings. Please do not forward or post them just to be the first one. Have some respect.”
Mathur urged people to “stop the insensitivity”.
She tweeted: “Just came across a disgusting, completely invasive video of Rishi sir on WhatsApp in hospital actually titled ‘last video of RK’ obviously shot by a hospital staff member. I know humanity is at sea at the moment but can we PLEASE STOP THIS INSENSITIVITY and not be party to Mathur?”
Mini also tagged Mumbai Police to take strict actions against the offender.
“If you see a video like this on any group can you please insist that it’s taken down??? Can we stop this vicarious celeb goggling even when they are indisposed and unaware? It should be a legal offence @MumbaiPolice and met with the strictest action,” Mini added.
Rishi died at HN Reliance Hospital in Mumbai on Thursday. He had been battling cancer since 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pakistani Actor Apologises for Joke About Deaths of B-Town Celebs Irrfan Khan, Sridevi</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi (Sputnik): This week has been especially rough on the Indian and global film industry after it lost two legendary actors – Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan. While 67-year old Rishi Kapoor died in a battle with cancer, Irrfan succumbed to a colon infection in Mumbai. India has taken these events as a "personal loss".
Pakistani Actor Adnan Siddiqui has issued an apology for being part of a “distasteful mockery” on the demise of Irrfan Khan, and another late veteran actress Sridevi.
Issuing an apology, Siddiqui wrote, “It was an extremely callous act to joke about the deceased. This is in very bad taste, not only does it show him and me but also the entire country in bad light".
​Earlier this week, Adnan Siddiqui was invited by Pakistani TV host Aamir Liaquat to his show “Jeeway Pakistan”. During the show, Liaquat credited Siddiqui – who has worked with both, Sridevi and Irrfan in the past, for “saving the lives” of Bollywood actresses Rani Mukherjee and Bipasha Basu by “not working with them” in some Bollywood projects that were extended to him.
Liaquat’s insensitive joke basically pointed out that both Bollywood actors died after having worked with Siddiqui. The “joke” was also given added dimensions with sound effects that were meant to sound funny.
Aged 50 years, Siddiqui had paired up with late Bollywood beauty Sridevi in her last movie titled “Mom” that was released in 2017. The Pakistani actor paired up with Irrfan in 2007 for an English film called “A Mighty Heart” which was produced by Hollywood heartthrob Brad Pitt and starred Angelina Jolie as the female lead.
After facing flak on social media for his participation in Liaquat’s “nonsensical mockery”, Siddiqui has apologised to the families and fans of both, Irrfan as well as Sridevi. The actor who highlighted his “uneasy expressions” during the show had also uploaded tributary posts for Irrfan and Rishi Kapoor on his Instagram handle.
Born in 1967 in India’s Pink City – Jaipur – Irrfan contributed to the global entertainment industry with his diverse acting skills for over 30 years. Along with Bollywood movies, Irrfan has been a part of major Hollywood projects including Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire, The Amazing Spider-Man, Inferno, and Jurrasic World.
On the other hand, yesteryear superstar Sridevi, who accidently drowned in her bathtub in a Dubai hotel in 2018, is touted as one of the most iconic and evergreen Bollywood actresses of all times.
The deaths of these superstars have been a matter of great emotion in the country, where Bollywood unites all 1.37 billion Indians – despite all of their glorious diversity.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A video of late Rishi Kapoor, during his last hours from the ICU, was leaked online earlier today. Many Bollywood celebrities took to their social media handles, urging people not to share it if they come across the video. Reportedly, the video shows an intensive care unit staff sneakily recording the actor's struggles.

Many celebs bashed the video and the people who are sharing it. Arjun Kapoor without mentioning about the video wrote, "The choice is not to post something is sometimes as important as to be the first to post something. Images have a lot of power lest we forget. Sometimes humanity and empathy must prevail over being first to embrace use of sly voyeuristic material presented to you."
Actor Karan Wahi said he too came across the video and decided to delete it immediately as he found it disturbing. A report in TOI read Karan as saying, "There's a forward that a ward boy or someone from the hospital has shot of Rishi Kapoor in his hospital just before he passed. I saw it. And think it's a gross violation of his privacy. If you receive it, delete it rather than forward it further."
He added: "Actors are also human beings. Please do not forward or post them just to be the first one. Have some respect."
Mini Mathur took to her twitter page earlier today and urged fans to "stop the insensitivity". In a thread she wrote, "Just came across a disgusting, completely invasive video of Rishi sir on WhatsApp in hospital actually titled "last video of RK" obviously shot by a hospital staff member.I know humanity is at sea at the moment but can we PLEASE STOP THIS INSENSITIVITY and not be party to this?"
She later also asked Mumbai Police to find the offender, "If you see a video like this on any group can you please insist that it's taken down??? Can we stop this vicarious celeb goggling even when they are indisposed and unaware? It should be a legal offence @MumbaiPolice and met with the strictest action,"
On Thursday, only a few hours after his passing, another video of Rishi Kapoor from the hospital had gone viral. The video showed a man singing Rishi Kapoor's hit song Tere dard se dil aabaad raha from Deewana, while standing besides the late actor. Many netizens claimed the video was from the time when the actor was receiving cancer treatment in New York, and not recent.
Rishi Kapoor breathed his last at HN Reliance Hospital in Mumbai on Thursday, April 30, 2020, after battling cancer for two years.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ananya Panday who was last seen in the movie ‘Pati Patni Aur Woh’, will next be seen sharing the screen space with Deepika Padukone and Siddhant Chaturvedi in a Shakun Batra directorial. This is the first time that this trio is coming together, and the audience can’t wait to see their work on the big screen. Even Ananya is equally excited to work with Deepika and reportedly while talking about her she revealed a wonderful thing when she said that the ‘Padmavat’ star is more beautiful on the inside than on the outside.
She also mentioned that with Deepika, one doesn’t feel like being overpowered by a star; rather it feels like one is with a friend.
Further, in a recent interview Ananya reportedly expressed her wish of working with Ranveer Singh as well. And at the same time, since she is watching a number of horror movies, she would love to explore the dark spaces.
Meanwhile, besides the Shakun Batra directrial, Ananya has ‘Khaali Peeli’ opposite Ishaan Khatter and Puri Jagannadh's ‘Fighter’ with Vijay Deverakonda.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mammootty and Dulquer Salmaan, the megastar and young actor are one of the most loved father-son duos of the Indian film industry. As we all know, both Mammootty and Dulquer Salmaan have always set major fashion goals with their public appearances. The young actor has totally inherited the impeccable fashion sense of his father, the megastar.
Interestingly, a throwback picture of Mammootty and young Dulquer Salmaan has been winning the internet currently. The lovely picture, which was apparently clicked while Dulquer visited the sets of one of the Mammootty films, once again proves that both the father and son are very much alike when it comes to their choice of accessories.
Both Mammootty and the young Dulquer Salmaan are sporting sunglasses, which is the most favourite accessory for both of them, in the picture. The netizens, especially the fans of Mammootty and Dulquer Salmaan are totally in love with the picture, which is currently going viral on social media platforms.
Dulquer Salmaan has always mentioned that he is a complete daddy's boy and loves to follow his father's path in both the personal and professional life. The young actor has also revealed that his father is his all-time favourite actor. Dulquer Salmaan has also mentioned that his father is the most genuine person he has ever seen.
Mammootty, on the other hand, is very particular about staying away from his son's professional life. Interestingly, the megastar never talks about Dulquer Salmaan in his interviews and says that 'I don't make comments about other actors', whenever he was asked to speak about his son.
According to Dulquer, Mammootty had made it clear he is not going to launch him or produce his films, when he first expressed his desire to act in films. The megastar had advised the young actor to learn acting first and try to find opportunities on his own. Well, we are sure that Dulquer Salmaan is making his father proud today with his achievements.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Disha Patani To Flaunt Her Killer Moves In An Item Song For Allu Arjun’s Pushpa?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Disha Patani is all set to make a comeback in Tollywood. Yes, you heard it right! The Bollywood diva, who made her debut with 2015 Telugu film Loafer, is gearing up to raise the temperature with her killer moves. As per rumours Disha, who is currently busy with her Bollywood projects, will also be a part of Allu Arjun's Pushpa. She will be sharing screen space with the Stylish Star for an item number in the action-thriller. If the rumour has anything to go by, the movie will mark her re-entry after five years of Puri Jagannadh's directorial, Loafer.
On a related note, Pushpa will have South diva Rashmika Mandanna essaying the female lead. There were also rumours suggesting that Allu Arjun and Rashmika Mandanna will not be romantically paired in the film, which disappointed many fans. The makers rubbished the rumour saying that there is no second actress in the highly anticipated thriller. There is also buzz that Bollywood star Suniel Shetty will be essaying the antagonist in the film. Well, an official confirmation about the cast is awaited from the makers' side. Earlier, Vijay Sethupathi had walked out of the project citing creative difference with the team. He has been replaced with Kannada actor Dhananjay to reprise the role.
The first look poster, unveiled on Allu Arjun's birthday, showed a rough and tough rugged look of the actor, which stirred the excitement of his fans. Adding to the thrill, it is rumoured that he will be sporting a stylish avatar of a don in the action-thriller for a flashback sequence. Pushpa bankrolled by Mythri Movie Makers, will arrive in the theatres next year. However, the release date is yet to be confirmed.
Coming back to Disha Patani, the actress will next be seen in KTina directed by Ashima Chibber and Prabhu Deva's Radhe alongside Salman Khan. Radhe's release has been reportedly postponed from Eid to an indefinite date due to the ongoing pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Disha Patani To Make A Special Appearance In Allu Arjun’s Pushpa? Deets Inside</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Allu Arjun’s upcoming action-thriller Pushpa is one of the most awaited films of the year. Ever since the first look of the film has been unveiled, fans are excited to watch the film. Apart from all the news and hype around the film, we hear that Bollywood babe Disha Patani has also been roped in for the film.
If media reports are to be believed, Disha Patani has been roped in for a special dance number in Pushpa. The actress will be seen grooving with Allu Arjun in the peppy dance number. Reports elaborate that Disha Patani has been approached by the makers for a song, but she has not yet given the nod.
For the unversed, Disha Patani had earlier taken to Instagram and lauded the South actor for his terrific dance moves. And well, if the media reports are true, then it’ll be a delight to see the two in one frame.
However, while the rumour about Disha Patani being a part of Pushpa is going strong, there is no official confirmation on the said news. Talking about the film, it stars Allu Arjun opposite the ever-gorgeous Rashmika Mandanna. Helmed by Sukumar, the movie is co-produced by Y. Naveen whereas the music for the same has been composed by Devi Sri Prasad.
Coming back to Disha Patani, the actress who made her debut in films with Telugu film Loafer opposite Varun Tej, rose to fame with M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story. The actress was last seen in Mohit Suri’s Malang opposite Aditya Roy Kapoor.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mahesh Babu's next project with Parasuram is currently the talk of the town. The makers of the yet-to-be-titled movie are on a search for the leading lady and a recent rumour suggest that the makers have zeroed in on their options and are thinking to cast the overnight sensation Priya Prakash Varrier for the action thriller.
Well, the director of the movie Parasuram has rubbished the rumour, calling it baseless. He stated that the casting has not yet been finalized and the team has not thought of casting Priya at all. There were also rumours that Mahesh's Bharat Ane Nenu co-star Kiara Advani might sign the film. Keerthy Suresh was also rumoured to be a part of the film. Well, the fans are awaiting for the official confirmation of the leading lady in the film, bankrolled by Mythri Movie Makers. The pre-production of the Parasuram directorial has begun amid the lockdown, and the shooting will start as soon as the lockdown gets lifted.
Priya Prakash Varrier has got her hands full with films in Bollywood and South. The actress will be seen in Chandrasekhar Yeleti's Check, alongside Nithiin. The actress became an overnight star after her wink video from the Malayalam film Oru Adaar Love went viral. The movie, which was remade into Telugu titled Lovers Day, failed to impress the audience terribly at the theatres.
On the other hand, Mahesh Babu made to the headlines with Baahubali director SS Rajamouli's announcement of joining hands with him. As per the latest reports, Mahesh Babu will be essaying the role of a spy with a touch of James Bond-like character in the highly anticipated movie. An official confirmation about the genre is awaited post the lockdown. It is said that Rajamouli will begin the pre-production work and shoot for Mahesh's project once he is done with his RRR commitments. It is also said that Mahesh Babu will be a part of Koratala Siva's next after Acharya.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte is often compared to a young Prince William, but fans are saying she looks just like one of her distant relatives</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princess Charlotte turned 5 years old on Saturday, and with her birthday came a new round of royal photographs taken by Kate Middleton herself.
In the photos that were released to mark her birthday, Princess Charlotte is shown helping her family deliver packages of meals to people in need. The young royal also posed for a formal portrait, which was also taken by the Duchess of Cambridge.
Photos of Princess Charlotte, the middle child and only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are often compared to pictures of Prince William from when he was around the same age.
Prince William once even confused a childhood photo of himself for a picture of his daughter.
However, Princess Charlotte’s latest birthday portraits have brought to light another royal lookalike – one of her older cousins, Lady Sarah Chatto.
Lady Sarah Chatto is the only daughter of the late Princess Margaret, the Queen’s sister. This makes Lady Sarah Chatto a niece of the Queen, and a second cousin of Princess Charlotte.
Above, a photo from around 1969 shows a young Lady Sarah Chatto (then Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones) with her brother, Viscount Linley.
Princess Charlotte looked especially similar to her cousin when she wore a similar green coat and even, ironically, had her hair styled in a similar fashion during the family’s Christmas celebrations in 2019.
Other photos of young Lady Sarah Chatto resemble Princess Charlotte’s signature cheeky facial expressions and bashful waves.
Another interesting detail about the two distant cousins is that Lady Sarah Chatto’s birthday is May 1, and Princess Charlotte’s birthday is May 2. The cousins are some 51 years apart in age, but photos of the two taken around the same time of their lives have some pretty uncanny similarities.
In addition to Lady Sarah Chatto and Prince William, pictures of Princess Charlotte have also been compared to childhood photos of her great-grandma Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Diana, and Lady Kitty Spencer, the niece of Princess Diana.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte is often compared to a young Prince William, but fans are saying she looks just like one of her distant relatives, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princess Charlotte turned 5 years old on Saturday, and with her birthday came a new round of royal photographs taken by Kate Middleton herself.
In the photos that were released to mark her birthday, Princess Charlotte is shown helping her family deliver packages of meals to people in need. The young royal also posed for a formal portrait, which was also taken by the Duchess of Cambridge.
Photos of Princess Charlotte, the middle child and only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are often compared to pictures of Prince William from when he was around the same age.
Prince William once even confused a childhood photo of himself for a picture of his daughter.
However, Princess Charlotte’s latest birthday portraits have brought to light another royal lookalike – one of her older cousins, Lady Sarah Chatto.
Lady Sarah Chatto is the only daughter of the late Princess Margaret, the Queen’s sister. This makes Lady Sarah Chatto a niece of the Queen, and a second cousin of Princess Charlotte.
Above, a photo from around 1969 shows a young Lady Sarah Chatto (then Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones) with her brother, Viscount Linley.
Princess Charlotte looked especially similar to her cousin when she wore a similar green coat and even, ironically, had her hair styled in a similar fashion during the family’s Christmas celebrations in 2019.
Other photos of young Lady Sarah Chatto resemble Princess Charlotte’s signature cheeky facial expressions and bashful waves.
Another interesting detail about the two distant cousins is that Lady Sarah Chatto’s birthday is May 1, and Princess Charlotte’s birthday is May 2. The cousins are some 51 years apart in age, but photos of the two taken around the same time of their lives have some pretty uncanny similarities.
In addition to Lady Sarah Chatto and Prince William, pictures of Princess Charlotte have also been compared to childhood photos of her great-grandma Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Diana, and Lady Kitty Spencer, the niece of Princess Diana.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Royals celebrate Princess Charlotte's 5th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON - The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have released new photographs to celebrate their daughter Princess Charlotte's 5th birthday.
The couple's middle child turned five on Saturday and they posted four new pictures to their Twitter account the day before and added a fifth picture on her birthday.
They wrote: "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share four new photographs of Princess Charlotte ahead of her fifth birthday tomorrow.
"The images were taken by The Duchess as the family helped to pack up and deliver food packages for isolated pensioners in the local area."
A message on the couple's Kensington Palace Twitter account on Saturday added: "Thank you for all your lovely messages on Princess Charlotte's fifth birthday!
"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share a new photograph of Princess Charlotte, taken by The Duchess this April."
All of the pictures were taken by keen amateur photographer Catherine and four of them showed Charlotte helping to pack homemade pasta and deliver food parcels to isolated pensioners near the family's home Anmer Hall, in Norfolk.
The entire family, including Prince William, 37, Duchess Catherine, 38, and their sons Prince George, six and Prince Louis, two, helped Charlotte deliver the food parcels, as part of an initiative started by Queen Elizabeth's staff at her Sandringham estate.
They spent two and a half hours driving around to deliver food and one delighted resident told the Daily Mail newspaper: "They got drenched as it was pouring with the rain but I think they just wanted to do their bit."
Meanwhile, Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla wished the youngster a happy birthday via Twitter, sharing one of Catherine's pictures and writing: "Wishing Princess Charlotte a very Happy Birthday."
And a message on the official Royal Family's account read: "A very Happy Birthday to Princess Charlotte who is celebrating her 5th birthday today. Princess Charlotte is The Queen's fifth great-grandchild.
"To mark the day @KensingtonRoyal have released new photos of Princess Charlotte taken by The Duchess of Cambridge."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte Has a Surprise Royal Twin</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Today is Princess Charlotte's fifth birthday, which means she joins the ranks of those of us who have to celebrate in quarantine. But her parents seem to be doing their best to give her a great birthday. On Friday, they posted four new photos that Kate Middleton took of the little royal to mark her special day. Royal fans who saw the images noticed one thing in particular: Charlotte has a royal twin.
Per Hello! magazine, the princess bears a resemblance to Lady Sarah Chatto, the only daughter of Princess Margaret, Queen Elizabeth's sister. Charlotte has also been compared to her great-grandmother the Queen; People magazine compared their childhood photos on the occasion of Charlotte's birthday, and the resemblance is definitely clear.
It makes sense that others would think she looks like Elizabeth's niece Sarah. When you look at Elizabeth, Margaret, and Sarah, it's very obvious that they're all related. It looks like Charlotte is taking after the Windsor side! Here's another photo of her that her parents added today:
One of the photos Kate took shows Princess Charlotte delivering food to people who are self-isolating in the global pandemic. In the photo, you can see a reflection of Kate and William in the door on which Charlotte is knocking.
Besides doing good deeds for others in quarantine, Charlotte and her brothers appear to have been having a lot of fun at home with their parents.
"Children have got such stamina," Kate said in a BBC interview last month. "I don't know how, honestly. You get to the end of the day and you write a list of all the things you've done in that day. You've pitched a tent, take the tent down again, cook, bake, you get to the end of the day. They've had a lovely time. It's amazing how much you can cram into one day, that's for sure."
Let's hope Charlotte has a birthday full of tens, cooking, baking, and lots of birthday hugs from her family.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New photos released for Princess Charlotte's 5th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2 (UPI) -- Britain's Kensington Palace released four new photos of Princess Charlotte in honor of her fifth birthday Saturday.
"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share four new photographs of Princess Charlotte ahead of her fifth birthday tomorrow. The images were taken by The Duchess as the family helped to pack up and deliver food packages for isolated pensioners in the local area," the palace captioned Friday's snapshots, which show the tiny royal wearing a black-and-white houndstooth coat-dress.
Charlotte is the middle child of Prince William and his wife, Kate Middleton.
The couple, who celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary Wednesday, are also parents to Prince George, 6, and Prince Louis, 2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte marks fifth birthday delivering food packages</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princess Charlotte's fifth birthday has been marked by the release of photographs showing the young royal helping to load a van with food and delivering meals for those in need.
Charlotte was volunteering with her parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and brothers Prince George and Prince Louis, ahead of her birthday which she celebrates on Saturday.
The princess is shown in two photographs holding white bags of fresh food for pensioners shielding themselves due to the coronavirus outbreak or other vulnerable people in lockdown in Norfolk.
In another image she knocks on the door of an elderly resident as she holds a bag of fresh pasta which William, Kate and their children spent several hours making the day before the delivery.
Four pictures, taken in April by Kate, have been released and the final photograph is a portrait of her daughter smiling as she looks straight at the camera.
The Cambridges got soaked as they made their rounds, likely to be in the area around their home of Anmer Hall which is on the Queen's Norfolk estate of Sandringham.
Over the past five weeks, the Queen's Sandringham staff have been preparing and delivering meals for pensioners and vulnerable people living in the local area, Buckingham Palace has said.
Around 1,000 meals were made and delivered in the first week alone.
It is not known if William was behind the wheel of the delivery van which was from the Sandringham Visitor Centre.
The birthday girl's full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge,.
She was born at the private maternity Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London, at 8.34am on May 2 2015, weighing 8lb 3oz.
Kate is a keen amateur photographer and patron of the Royal Photographic Society which has regularly released pictures she has taken of George, six, and Louis, two, to mark their birthdays.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte’s birthday: Her life in pictures so far</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The young royal, who has become known and loved for her cheekiness, sassiness and adorable royal waves to the press and public, will today be celebrating her birthday at home in Anmer Hall with her family. 
To mark the occasion of her fifth birthday, her parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, have released new images of the youngster.
Snapped by keen amateur photographer Kate recently near their home in Norfolk, the photos show Charlotte lending a helping hand in the local neighbourhood.
The new photos were taken when Prince William, Kate and the kids helped pack up and deliver homemade pasta and food packages for the vulnerable and isolated pensioners living in their local area in Norfolk. 
The photos, published by Kensington Palace on social media, have received thousands of comments from well wishers.
So, as Princess Charlotte celebrates turning the grand old age of five, we look back at her life in pictures so far, from her first introduction to the public outside the Lindo Wing in London, to her first royal tour, day of school and the moment she proved she mastered her Great Grandmother’s iconic royal wave. 
Princess Charlotte of Cambridge was born on the May 2 2015 in the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital in London. 
The second child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, she joined her big brother Prince George in one of the most famous families in the world and became fourth in line to the British throne. 
Despite rumours that she may be named Alice, Kate and William chose the moniker Charlotte for their little girl, which just so happens to be the middle name of her aunt – Kate’s sister – Pippa Middleton.
She is also named in honour of two very important women in Prince William’s life – his grandmother the Queen and his late mother, Princess Diana.
Princess Charlotte’s full name is Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge.
There hasn’t been a member of the royal family called Charlotte in over two hundred years, so this little Princess was destined to make her mark and carve her own path. 
At the tender age of five, Princess Charlotte has already completed her fair share of royal duties and appearances, joining her parents on her first ever royal tour before she was 18 months old. 
Charlotte also joined her family on The Duke and Duchess’s official visit to Poland and Germany in July 2017.
Before joining her big brother Prince George at Thomas’s Battersea school in London in September last year, Princess Charlotte attended Willcocks Nursery School in London.
The feisty character was reportedly known as the ‘warrior princess’ at nursery thanks to her confidence. 
In March 2017, Kate revealed that Princess Charlotte was ‘the one in charge’ in their family and she was ‘very chatty and likes doing play dates with George.’
According to royal expert and author Katie Nicholl, Charlotte loves playing outside and exploring: ‘She loves climbing trees and she’s very much an adventurer, she was quite known for her feisty personality.’
Happy Birthday Charlotte!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Happy 5th Birthday, Princess Charlotte: See The Royal’s Cutest Photos Of All-Time</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prince William and Kate Middleton’s middle child, Princess Charlotte, turns five years old on May 2, and of course, we have to celebrate! It’s hard to believe that it’s been FIVE years since the royals brought their little bundle of joy home from the hospital, and Charlotte has been growing up right before our eyes. In pictures and videos, she’s proven to be quite sassy and outgoing, and there’s no denying that she’s absolutely adorable. We’ve rounded up some of Charlotte’s cutest photos of all in honor of her big day.
Some of the most adorable moments of Queen Elizabeth‘s granddaughter have occurred at weddings. She captivated our hearts alongside her brother, Prince George, at Pippa Middleton‘s wedding, where she served as one of the bridesmaids. Since then, she’s perfected the craft of being a show-stealing wedding party member. At her uncle, Prince Harry‘s, wedding to Meghan Markle in May 2018, Charlotte stuck her tongue out at the crowd from the car she was riding in to St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.
After getting out of the car, the princess joined her parents and brother. She could be seen smiling at the crowd while holding a bouquet in one hand and her mom’s hand in the other. Later that year, she was a bridesmaid yet again at Princess Eugenie‘s wedding where she captivated onlookers by adorably waving to the crowds and cameras.
But weddings aren’t the only setting where Charlotte has stolen our hearts. From doing somersaults at Polo matches to waving at cameras while heading to the hospital to meet her baby brother Prince Louis, there’s been no shortage of sweet moments involving William and Kate’s daughter. Head up to the gallery above to see more of her cute pics! Happy birthday, Princess Charlotte!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Royal fans are going wild over  the 'uncanny' family resemblance between Princess Charlotte and the Queen's niece Lady Sarah Chatto in childhood snaps.
To mark her birthday, Kensington Palace has released new pictures of Charlotte as she helped her parents deliver home-made pasta to vulnerable Norfolk residents isolated by coronavirus earlier this week. 
And many have been left stunned by the likeness between Princess Charlotte, 5, and Princess Margaret's daughter Lady Sarah, 56, after royal expert Victoria Arbiter tweeted a side-by-side of the duo.
The post was quickly inundated with comments noting the similarities between the two royal ladies. 
One person said: 'I'm blue in the face from saying she is Lady Sarah's double since she was born.'
Meanwhile another commented: 'Amazing resemblance to her cousin.'
Another wrote: 'Oh wow! Look at that resemblance.'
Another added: 'I've always thought Charlotte favours Sarah.' 
After she shared the side-by-side comparison, Victoria commented: 'I've always thought she looked like Lady Sarah, but with them both aged 5 the resemblance is uncanny.' 
New commemorative portraits were, as usual, taken by keen amateur snapper Kate, earlier this week in between home schooling sessions at Anmer Hall, the family's Norfolk home on the Queen's Sandringham estate. 
The entire family helped out with a local initiative started by the monarch's staff, who have been preparing and delivering meals for pensioners and the vulnerable in the area during the lockdown.
After sharing four images of the little royal yesterday, the couple went on to thank fans for their well wishes and released a fifth picture today.
In the new snap, which was taken by Kate as part of the series, the little royal can be seen thoughtfully holding one of the parcels of pasta.
Around 1,000 meals were dispensed in the first week alone, and the scheme has been running for five weeks so far.
This time the Cambridges, all keen cooks, rustled up some home-made pasta which they separated into 12 large bags and tied up with raffia to add to the food parcels. Sources said all the children – even little Louis, two – were involved.
The following day, the family – Charlotte smartly dressed in a black and white checked dress with grey tights and black Mary Jane shoes – then helped to load bags of fresh produce into a van from the Sandringham Visitors' Centre ready for delivery.
Sources say William, Kate, Charlotte and George spent two and a half hours driving around the area delivering food to those in need.
The princess can even be seen in one picture proudly knocking on an elderly resident's door with her goodies, standing on a mat which reads 'Welcome Home, Wipe Your Feet'.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A 'very Happy fifth Birthday' Lottie! The Queen shares a throwback snap with Princess Charlotte as she and Prince Charles share their 'best wishes' with the little royal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Queen and Prince Charles were among the first members of the royal family to share their best wishes with Princess Charlotte as the youngster celebrates her fifth birthday today.
Taking to Instagram today, the Queen's, 93, official account shared several snaps of Her Majesty alongside the little royal, including one alongside Prince Philip taken at Trooping the Colour in 2017 
Meanwhile Prince Charles, 72, also shared his 'best wishes for a very happy birthday' with the five-year-old today, posting a portrait taken by Kate Middleton, 38, to mark the day.
To mark her birthday, Kensington Palace has released new pictures of Charlotte as she helped her parents deliver home-made pasta to vulnerable Norfolk residents isolated by coronavirus earlier this week.
Posting on Instagram today, the Royal Family account shared a series of images to mark the big day, including a photograph of the little royal acting as a flower girl at Princess Eugenie's wedding.
Other images in the series included one of Princess Charlotte with her mother Kate, the Queen and Prince Philip, 98, during Trooping the Colour in 2017.
Another sees the Queen surrounded by her grandchildren and greatgrandchildren, with Princess Charlotte taking centre stage on Her Majesty's lap.
The image is just one of a series of photographs that was shot by contributing photographer Leibovitz to mark the Queen's 90th birthday in April 2016. 
Meanwhile Prince Charles' account Clarence House posted just one image of the little royal, the commemorative image taken by the Duchess last week.
They wrote: 'Wishing Princess Charlotte a very Happy Birthday - five today!'
The daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who is currently isolating in Norfolk with her family, is likely to chat over the phone with her great-grandmother The Queen and other loved ones on her special day.
In spite of the extraordinary circumstances around her birthday this year, Kate Middleton and Prince William have reportedly planned a fun day for their daughter's birthday on their Anmer Hall home. 
A source told the Sun: 'The family has arranged a Zoom party for her, so she can speak to family and friends. Then, they have put together a full plan that will give her all the fun of a birthday – including cake and games – despite the extraordinary circumstances we are faced with.' 
'Her great-grandmother will be joining the family call on the big day. As far as Charlotte is concerned, the important part is that her whole family are by her side to say: "Happy Birthday".' 
New commemorative portraits were, as usual, taken by keen amateur snapper Kate, earlier this week in between home schooling sessions at Anmer Hall, the family's Norfolk home on the Queen's Sandringham estate. 
The entire family helped out with a local initiative started by the monarch's staff, who have been preparing and delivering meals for pensioners and the vulnerable in the area during the lockdown.
After sharing four images of the little royal yesterday, the couple went on to thank fans for their well wishes and released a fifth picture today.
In the new snap, which was taken by Kate as part of the series, the little royal can be seen thoughtfully holding one of the parcels of pasta.
Around 1,000 meals were dispensed in the first week alone, and the scheme has been running for five weeks so far.
This time the Cambridges, all keen cooks, rustled up some home-made pasta which they separated into 12 large bags and tied up with raffia to add to the food parcels. Sources said all the children – even little Louis, two – were involved.
The following day, the family – Charlotte smartly dressed in a black and white checked dress with grey tights and black Mary Jane shoes – then helped to load bags of fresh produce into a van from the Sandringham Visitors' Centre ready for delivery.
Sources say William, Kate, Charlotte and George spent two and a half hours driving around the area delivering food to those in need.
The princess can even be seen in one picture proudly knocking on an elderly resident's door with her goodies, standing on a mat which reads 'Welcome Home, Wipe Your Feet'.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte joins parents in charity food deliveries as she turns 5</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New photographs of Princess Charlotte have been released to mark her fifth birthday.
The young royal is seen helping to load a van with food and delivering meals for those in need amid the coronavirus crisis.
Charlotte was volunteering with her parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and brothers Prince George and Prince Louis, ahead of her birthday which she celebrates on Saturday.
The princess is shown in two photographs holding white bags of fresh food for pensioners shielding themselves due to the coronavirus outbreak or other vulnerable people in lockdown in Norfolk.
In another image she knocks on the door of an elderly resident as she holds a bag of fresh pasta which William, Kate and their children spent several hours making the day before the delivery.
Four pictures, taken in April by Kate, have been released and the final photograph is a portrait of her daughter smiling as she looks straight at the camera.
The Cambridges got soaked as they made their rounds, likely to be in the area around their home of Anmer Hall which is on the Queen’s Norfolk estate of Sandringham.
Over the past five weeks, the Queen’s Sandringham staff have been preparing and delivering meals for pensioners and vulnerable people living in the local area, Buckingham Palace has said.
Around 1,000 meals were made and delivered in the first week alone.
It is not known if William was behind the wheel of the delivery van which was from the Sandringham Visitor Centre.
The birthday girl’s full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge.
She was born at the private maternity Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, central London, at 8.34am on May 2 2015, weighing 8lb 3oz.
Kate is a keen amateur photographer and patron of the Royal Photographic Society which has regularly released pictures she has taken of George, six, and Louis, two, to mark their birthdays.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In pictures: Princess Charlotte celebrates fifth birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain’s Princess Charlotte, daughter of Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton, celebrates her fifth birthday on Saturday – an occasion marked by the release of four new photographs of the young royal.
The pictures shared by the Royal account were taken by the Duchess of Cambridge. The post also shared an adorable caption.
“The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share four new photographs of Princess Charlotte ahead of her fifth birthday tomorrow.” it read. ” The images were taken by The Duchess as the family helped to pack up and deliver food packages for isolated pensioners in the local area.”
The photographs were taken last month by her mother at the Sandringham Estate in eastern England where the family helped to pack and deliver food parcels for isolated pensioners in the local area.
Last month, Charlotte’s great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth, the world’s oldest and longest-serving monarch, turned 94. However, there was little fanfare to mark that occasion as Britain endures a nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus outbreak – its worst national crisis since World War Two.

Kensington Palace uploaded the stunning snaps to their Twitter account on the eve of the toddler Princess’ birthday.
“The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share four new photographs of Princess Charlotte ahead of her fifth birthday tomorrow,” the Royals wrote.
The never-before-seen images, which were impressively taken by the Duchess herself, were snapped at Sandringham Estate.
Donning a gorgeous black and white gingham dress, the young royal can be seen helping her family pack and deliver food packages to isolated pensioners in Norfolk, England.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jake Gyllenhaal whispered to his rising homemade bread, and people are raving about the actor's sourdough starter expertise</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jake Gyllenhaal and host Stephen Colbert recently bonded over their newfound affinity for making bread from scratch.
It’s no wonder that the actor and late-night TV show host have taken to making their own bread, as it’s recently become a popular pastime. Some people are turning loaves into edible works of art, while others have gotten creative by trying bread recipes that don’t require a sourdough starter.
In an episode of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” that was released on Wednesday, Gyllenhaal talked about how he got his start with the art of homemade bread-making, and he appeared to whisper to his rising loaf of bread.
“I’ve found myself falling in love with sourdough,” Gyllenhaal told Colbert. “I have a good friend who’s a baker in San Francisco . . . we were talking, and I hate this, but I was like, ‘Can you teach me how to do a sourdough starter?’ And off I went.”
Colbert then showed Gyllenhaal his container of sourdough bread starter, which was in a plastic container.
He asked Gyllenhaal for baking advice: “Now what do I do?”
Gyllenhaal responded by lifting a rising loaf of homemade bread to the camera.
“To go from that, to this, which is resting. It’s not yet fully rising, but it’s on its way,” Gyllenhaal said in a whisper.
“What I do with it, is I take the starter, and then you have to get a nicer wheat flour,” Gyllenhaal told Colbert. “You make what they call, in America, a pre-ferment. You let that rest for 12 to 24 hours, and then, you can start mixing it up into some other flour, and then make your dough.”
Gyllenhaal’s soothing yet serious way of tending to his rising sourdough – and the nearly five minutes of the episode he spent talking about bread – seemed to capture the hearts of fans and viewers of the show.
Gyllenhaal also spoke to Colbert about his performance in a musical tribute to Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim, as well as his attempt at the T-Shirt handstand challenge after being tagged by his “Spider-Man: Far From Home” costar Tom Holland.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: Pakistani actor Adnan Siddiqui faced criticism comments made by a TV show host. The host joked about Siddiqui's deceased former co-stars Sridevi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan. The actor apologised through his social media channels calling the whole episode a "callous act".
The host of the TV show 'Jeeway Pakistan', Aamir Liaquat, joked with Siddiqui on the show about how Siddiqui had 'saved lives' of two well-known stars by not doing certain movies.
After Siddiqui seemed to not get the joke, Liaquat's explanation took an insenitive turn when he brought up the now deceased former co-stars of the actor. Liaquat said, ”Look, you worked in Mom, Sri Devi passed away. You worked with Irrfan Khan, and now he died."
"Whoever works with you outside [Pakistani cinema] dies...", he added. 
Siddiqui looked uncomfortable and replied, "This isn't a joke for me. They were both very close to me..." The host then steers the conversation away.
Irrfan Khan died on Wednesday following a battle with a neuroendocrine tumour. Sridevi Kapoor died in February, 2018. Both were celebrated and respected actors, and their deaths shocked Bollywood.
Video footage of the show later went viral. Siddiqui posted an apology on his Twitter account and said, "So I don’t know how to explain what I’m feeling right now or what to say. But this needs to go out. I was invited on the live chat show ‘Jeewey Pakistan’ yesterday when this unfortunate incident happened. The anchor Amir Liaquat Sahab joked about something extremely sensitive. Not only were they both close to me but also as a human it was wrong on so many levels. I cannot even call it ‘hitting below the belt’.
"It was an extremely callous act to joke about the deceased. This is in very bad taste, not only does it show him and me but also the entire country in bad light. I want to apologise to the families of Sridevi Sahiba and lrrfan Khan Sahab, their loved ones and fans. If you see my body language I was extremely uncomfortable with what he said but I didn’t want to stoop to that level. I regret being on the show. I’ve learnt my lesson and I promise I will not tolerate such an act in future. I was hoping this bit wouldn’t become public but unfortunately it has. I’m sorry. Thank you."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dr Aamir Liaquat apologises for making insensitive remarks on TV</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dr Aamir Liaquat Hussain on Saturday apologised for making insensitive remarks about the deaths of Bollywood stars Sridevi and Irrfan Khan during a live Ramzan transmission.
According to the details, the anchor who does controversial Ramzan shoes every year took to Twitter saying that he was sorry for his remarks, adding that the person who asks for forgiveness is the bigger person.
The shocking incident had occurred during a show in which actor Adnan Siddiqui was a guest on the show.
Hussain shared how the Bollywood actors Siddiqui has worked with have passed away, namely Khan and Sridevi, with whom he had starred in A Mighty Heart and Mom respectively.
“On the show yesterday, I had a slip of tongue where I lost control of over the flow of my words. Such gaffes can happen in a live transmission and I regret saying what I said. When I said those words, they didn’t seem like a big deal to me but now that I have thought about it I realise that I shouldn’t have said that. I am sorry for this mistake on my part. Remember, the person who asks for forgiveness is the bigger person,” he said.
He went on to add, “Artists from across the border are very dear and respectable to us. I also praised them in the next segment of the show but that didn’t go viral. However, I sincerely apologise for the pain I might have caused to fans and followers around the world.”
Hussain continued that people should appreciate his gesture of accepting his mistake and apologising for it. “If anyone realises his wrongdoings, then the other person should display generosity and allow the person who committed the mistake to learn from it. I’m really sorry. This is my country, my people and I do everything for them. If I hurt my fellow countrymen, I would like to seek forgiveness and I hope you accept my apology.”
Earlier on Friday, Adnan had shared a post on social media expressing his shock and regret at what had happened, vowing to never be a part of such a show again.
“The anchor Aamir Liaquat Sahab joked about something extremely sensitive. Not only were they both close to me but also as a human it was wrong on so many levels. I cannot even call it hitting below the belt. It was an extremely callous act to joke about the deceased. This is in very bad taste, not only does it show him and me but also the entire country in bad light,” he said.
“I want to apologise to the families of Sridevi Sahiba and lrrfan Khan Sahab, their loved ones and fans. If you see my body language I was extremely uncomfortable with what he said but I didn’t want to stoop to that level. I regret being on the show. I’ve learnt my lesson and I promise I will not tolerate such an act in the future. I was hoping this bit wouldn’t become public but unfortunately, it has. I’m sorry,” he concluded.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pakistani Actor Adnan Siddiqui Apologises To Sridevi And Irrfan Khan's Families For The 'Callous' Statement Made By An Anchor On Their Demise</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MOM actor Adnan Siddiqui appeared on a talk show named Jeeway Pakistan hosted by Aamir Liaquat where he braced an uncomfortable statement made by the host on actors Sridevi and Irrfan Khan
Actor Adnan Siddiqui who has shared screen space with Bollywood stars like Sridevi and Irrfan Khan was recently put in an uncomfortable spot when an anchor of a show spoke about the death of the two legends. The Pakistani actor appeared as a guest on a show called Jeeway Pakistan which is hosted by Aamir Liaquat. During the conversation, the host made some callous statements that left the actor uncomfortable. Adnan then took to social media to speak about the incident and even offer an apology to the families of Sridevi and Irrfan Khan.
Adnan penned a post on Twitter and wrote, "The anchor Aamir Liaquat Sahab joked about something extremely sensitive. Not only were they both close to me but also as a human it was wrong on so many levels. I cannot even call it hitting below the belt. It was an extremely callous act to joke about the deceased. This is in very bad taste, not only does it show him and me but also the entire country in bad light." During the conversation, the anchor stated that actress Rani Mukerji and Bipasha Basu are still alive because Adnan refused to do films with them. Adnan did a film Sridevi (MOM) and Irrfan Khan (A Mighty Heart) and both the actors are no more.
He further wrote, "I want to apologise to the families of Sridevi Sahiba and lrrfan Khan Sahab, their loved ones and fans. If you see my body language I was extremely uncomfortable with what he said but I didn't want to stoop to that level."

In the end, the actor said that he has learnt the lesson and that he is sorry. "I regret being on the show. I've learnt my lesson and I promise I will not tolerate such an act in future. I was hoping this bit wouldn't become public but unfortunately it has. I'm sorry," he finished.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Aamir Liaquat Makes Shockingly Insensitive Comment About Irrfan Khan’s Death</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aamir Liaquat Hussain is best known for his controversial comments.
Recently, he made another shocking statement on live TV when he joked about the death of Bollywood megastar Irrfan Khan on his show, Jeevay Pakistan.
Pakistan’s showbiz star, Adnan Siddiqui, appeared as a guest on his show. The two spoke about different things from personal life to showbiz. Adnan Siddiqui was left in shock when Aamir Liaquat said that two people owe their lives to you, Rani Mukherjee and Bipasha Basu.
Adnan Siddiqui didn’t know what the host was talking about until he explained himself.
Highlighting the career of the Pakistani actor, he said, “You worked in Mom and Sri Devi died, you worked with Irrfan Khan as well and he passed away.”
“You were offered roles in Mardaani 2 and Jism 2 but you declined, so the actors of that movie owe their life to you,” he continued.
Siddiqui, who was taken aback by Liaquat’s comment merely said that it was not something to joke about.
There’s no doubt that Aamir Liaquat has no limit to his humor and is a self-centered individual. But to joke about someone’s death is a whole different thing. Previously, the host-turned politician was seen taking a dig at his own party leader and Prime Minister, Imran Khan. Moreover, rumors suggest that Liaquat has been wanting a ministry but is not getting one so, the only option left for him is to defame Imran Khan.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Thanks to royal family photographer Samir Hussein, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle may have a new favorite photo.
In a new interview with Us Weekly, Hussein shares that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were "really happy" with the now-iconic snapshot the photographer captured of the royal couple back in March. The photo in question was from the 2020 Endeavour Fund Awards in London—one of the last public appearances from the couple as active working royals— where Hussein captured the pair beaming at each other whilst under an umbrella as they arrived to the event.
"The picture that I took of Harry and Meghan in the rain recently, I’ve never had a reaction to a picture like that one. In terms of the reaction I’ve had from people, that’s got to be the most iconic from that point of view," Hussein told Us Weekly. "I spoke to some of their team and they were really happy about it and talking about it."
The photographer—who had spent time photographing the couple all around the world over the past few years, including locations such as Australia, Fiji and Africa—expressed how he'll miss being able to capture images of the pair due to their recent relocation to Los Angeles this spring.
"I’m really disappointed that I won’t get to photograph them so much anymore," admitted Hussein. "I hope to get to photograph them [again]."

    <h5 class="mb-1">In Pictures: Princess Charlotte turns five</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The young royal was born on May 2 2015 and is fourth in line to the throne.
Princess Charlotte, known for being one of the feistiest of the Queen’s great-grandchildren, is celebrating turning five.
Charlotte has been seen in recent weeks enthusiastically clapping for carers as the Cambridge family stay at their Anmer Hall mansion in Norfolk during the coronavirus pandemic.
Over the past year, the Duchess of Cambridge revealed that her daughter, whom she has been heard referring to by the nickname “Lottie”,  was “pretty good” with spicy food, and also liked olives.
One of Charlotte’s favourite books as a toddler was Julia Donaldson’s classic The Gruffalo, and the princess loves horses, just like her great-grandmother the Queen.
William and Kate’s middle child was born at 8.34am on May 2 2015, weighing 8lbs 3oz.
Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge made her debut on the steps of the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, London, the same day.
Since her last birthday, Charlotte has joined her family to explore Kate’s Back To Nature garden at the Chelsea Flower Show.
Prince George and Charlotte took off their shoes and paddled barefoot in the stream during their May excursion, with the princess shouting “Ooh la la” as she waded through the water.
When William asked Charlotte “Will you help George?”, the princess retorted “no” before skipping off.
In June, the Cambridge children gathered with their parents on the Buckingham Palace balcony for Trooping The Colour, with Charlotte waving her arms around to greet the crowds.
The fourth in line to the throne also had fun at the King’s Cup regatta on the Isle of Wight in July.
She was spotted poking her tongue out during the presentation ceremony after her mother had encouraged her to wave.
The princess’s big day came in September when she started school.
She arrived for her first day with her parents and George, looking a little nervous at first as she fiddled with her pony tail, but excited as she met her headteacher.
The young royal joined the Windsors for the Queen’s annual pre-Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace in December.
She was driven to the royal residence by her mother for the festive celebration.
The princess also made her first appearance at church on the Sandringham estate on Christmas Day.
Charlotte and George joined the rest of the royals as they met the public on the traditional walk from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalene Church.
One well-wisher gave the princess an inflatable flamingo and was rewarded with a hug.
A picture of Charlotte smelling a bluebell was released by Kate in February after the duchess spoke about how important being outside was for children.
The duchess was interviewed for the Happy Mum Happy Baby podcast hosted by Giovanna Fletcher.
Kate said: “I’ve got this one photo of Charlotte smelling a bluebell, and really for me, it’s moments like that mean so much to me as a parent.
“And I try every day to put moments like that in, even if they’re small or even if I don’t have time – but that in an ideal world is what I would like to do.”
A smiling Charlotte was seen applauding the country’s NHS workers in March, alongside George and younger brother Prince Louis.
She is being home schooled by William and Kate while the country is in lockdown.
But the duchess confessed it was “challenging” and admitted she kept her children in class during the Easter holidays to give their days “structure”.
She said it was not all “hardcore” as she found fun activities online and the children had been baking, cooking and pitching tents in the garden.

The young royal joined the Windsors for the Queen’s annual pre-Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace in December.
She was driven to the royal residence by her mother for the festive celebration.
The princess also made her first appearance at church on the Sandringham estate on Christmas Day.
Charlotte and George joined the rest of the royals as they met the public on the traditional walk from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalene Church.
One well-wisher gave the princess an inflatable flamingo and was rewarded with a hug.
A picture of Charlotte smelling a bluebell was released by Kate in February after the duchess spoke about how important being outside was for children.
The duchess was interviewed for the Happy Mum Happy Baby podcast hosted by Giovanna Fletcher.
Kate said: “I’ve got this one photo of Charlotte smelling a bluebell, and really for me, it’s moments like that mean so much to me as a parent.
“And I try every day to put moments like that in, even if they’re small or even if I don’t have time – but that in an ideal world is what I would like to do.”
A smiling Charlotte was seen applauding the country’s NHS workers in March, alongside George and younger brother Prince Louis.
She is being home schooled by William and Kate while the country is in lockdown.
But the duchess confessed it was “challenging” and admitted she kept her children in class during the Easter holidays to give their days “structure”.
She said it was not all “hardcore” as she found fun activities online and the children had been baking, cooking and pitching tents in the garden.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lili Reinhart Slams ‘Cancel Culture’ And Defends Boyfriend Cole Sprouse From All The ‘Vile’ Haters Trending #ColeSprouseIsOver On Twitter!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Twitter tried to cancel Cole Sprouse, the hashtag‘#colesprouseisover’ managing to trend on the social media page! However, his girlfriend and Riverdale co-star, Lili Reinhart, was quick to come to his defense against the ‘vile’ haters!
It was also the actress’ way of slamming the whole canceling trend, her message being pretty much a PSA against it as well!
In a series of tweets that have been deleted in the meantime, Lili made it very clear that she’d like people to stop with the ‘#colesprouseisoverparty’ tweets!
She also stressed just how sick and tired she was of the whole ‘cancel culture.’
‘Twitter is such a vile place. It’s so easy to say s**t behind your f***ing phone, isn’t it? This is why people keep their relationships private… this is why people do not have social media.. because of this bullying. I don’t tolerate any of that s**t. Bully me? Sure fine. But attacking somebody for no reason, just for the sake of a f***ing twitter trend? Please…. reassess yourself and your ego before you post another tweet into the abyss,’ she wrote.
And that was not all! Reinhart stressed that people really need to stop with the canceling parties as well!
After all, sometimes they just come out of nowhere with no reason, just like it happened to her man, Cole Sprouse.
‘It’s easy to criticize someone and spew hate because it makes you feel like you have some sort of power over them. Truth is… you do not. Saying you hate someone or do not like them gives you no power over them. You need to tweet about someone you do not know in order to feel you have something going on in your life? That is sad. It’s really f***ing sad.’
The Riverdale actress went on to tell haters that attacking people online will never help them feel validated like they’d like to.
Instead, she encouraged them to ‘be better’ and do something ‘helpful with [their] time.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lili Reinhart hits out at trolls 'bullying' boyfriend Cole Sprouse</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lili Reinhart hit out at trolls for ‘bullying’ her boyfriend Cole Sprouse on Twitter.
The Riverdale star saw that the hashtag #ColeSprouseIsOverParty was trending and decided to call people out in a lengthy rant.
However, it looks as though the hashtag is trending for no apparent reason as many used the tag just to ask why Cole was even ‘over’.
Lili wrote in a now-deleted post: ‘Twitter is such a vile place. It’s so easy to say shit behind your f**king phone, isn’t it? This is why people choose to keep their relationships private… this is why people don’t have social media.. because of this bullying.
‘Please…. reassess yourself and your ego before you send another tweet into the abyss.
‘I refuse to keep my mouth shut about things like this. You have no idea how destructive this can be to someone. To anyone. It’s abusive. There is no excuse for this. You need god in your life or some form of help if you participate in cancel culture.’
Cole has yet to respond to the hashtag.
This incident isn’t the first time the Suite Life of Zack and Cody star has been the target of online abuse.
Cole had a massive rant about fans sending him death threats over rumours about his dating life and keeping his private life private.
Lili later appeared to add her two cents about the matter.
Taking to Twitter, she wrote: ‘Twitter is actually the most toxic form of social media. People are a**holes for the sake of being a**holes.
‘Do you not understand karma? It’s fine if you don’t, you’ll understand when it bites your miserable a**.’
While The Hustlers star also vented on Instagram too, writing: ‘Dear everyone on social media, Don’t put down people for the sake of putting them down.
‘Don’t be a f**king a**hole. The world doesn’t need anymore of that shit.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Twitter Tried to Cancel Cole Sprouse & Lili Reinhart Defended Him</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">No one is quite sure why Twitter tried to cancel Cole Sprouse this week, but his girlfriend Lili Reinhart is not having it.
The actress took to Twitter to post a series of tweets, which have since been deleted, to slam those who were using the #ColeSprouseIsOverParty hashtag.
“Twitter is such a vile place. It’s so easy to say sh-t behind your f–king phone, isn’t it? This is why people choose to keep their relationships private… this is why people don’t have social media.. because of this bullying,” Lili wrote in a tweet that was since deleted.
“I don’t tolerate any of that s–t. Bully me? Sure fine. But attacking someone for literally no reason, just for the sake of a f–king twitter trend?” Lili continued. “Please… reassess yourself and your ego before you send another tweet into the abyss.”
“It’s easy to criticize someone and spew hate because it makes you feel like you have some sort of power over them,” Lili said. “Truth is… you don’t. Saying you hate someone or don’t like them gives you absolutely no power over them.”
“You need to tweet about someone you literally don’t know in order to feel like you have something going on in your life? That’s sad. It’s really f–king sad. You want to feel validated or important? Attacking someone online won’t give that to you. Do something helpful with your time and be better,” Lili concluded.
Lili and Cole, who both star on The CW’s Riverdale, have been a couple since 2017. Just a couple weeks ago, she spoke out amid rumors that they had split.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lili Reinhart Defends Cole Sprouse From ‘Vile’ Haters After Twitter Tries To Cancel Him</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s not too clear why May kicked off with a Twitter hate campaign against Cole Sprouse. However, his Riverdale co-star and girlfriend Lili Reinhart, 23, doesn’t need an explanation — she’d just like people to stop tweeting “#colesprouseisoverparty.” In a series of now-deleted tweets, Lili shared her frustrated thoughts on cancel culture: “Twitter is such a vile place. It’s so easy to say s–t behind your f–king phone, isn’t it? This is why people choose to keep their relationships private… this is why people don’t have social media.. because of this bullying.”
“I don’t tolerate any of that s–t. Bully me? Sure fine,” Lili continued in another tweet. “But attacking someone for literally no reason, just for the sake of a f–king twitter trend? Please…. reassess yourself and your ego before you send another tweet into the abyss.”
Lili continued to stress why fans need to stop hopping on Twitter cancel parties, which sometimes start trending from out of the blue (as in Cole’s case). “It’s easy to criticize someone and spew hate because it makes you feel like you have some sort of power over them. Truth is… you don’t. Saying you hate someone or don’t like them gives you absolutely no power over them,” Lili continued in yet another tweet. “You need to tweet about someone you literally don’t know in order to feel like you have something going on in your life? That’s sad. It’s really f–king sad. You want to feel validated or important? Attacking someone online won’t give that to you. Do something helpful with your time and be better.”
Lili made it clear that she won’t stay silent when it comes to cyberbullying. “I refuse to keep my mouth shut about things like this. You have no idea how destructive this can be to someone. To anyone. It’s abusive. There is no excuse for this. You need god in your life or some form of help if you participate in cancel culture,” Lili wrote, concluding her Twitter rant.
Meanwhile, Cole, 27, had to recently defend himself against dating rumors, after he was seen leaving the same car as 18-year-old model Kaia Gerber on March 19. “I tolerate a lot of rumors and slander from people online claiming to be my fans,” Cole wrote on his Instagram Story on April 19. “Fans who feel entitled to my privacy precisely because I never indulge them. But attacking my friends, baseless accusations, leaking my address and sending death threats are all qualities of insanity and fanaticism. Choose humanity, stop being [clown emoji].”
Cole then seemingly addressed his longtime off-again, on-again relationship with Lili, whom he first sparked dating rumors with in early 2017 (shortly after Riverdalepremiered). “When I first stepped into a public relationship, this was one of the foreseeable consequences,” Cole wrote in another Instagram Story post. “And while I truly never intended to indulge any part of my private life to the ravenous horde, it’s clear my restraint in updating them has allowed them to push their own agenda onto my habits and lifestyle.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gorillaz have released their latest single, “How Far?” as a tribute to the late Afrobeat drummer Tony Allen, who features on the song along with Skepta. Allen died last Thursday and was a pioneer of the Afrobeat genre, drumming with Fela Kuti for 15 years. Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn was Allen’s bandmate in the supergroup Good, the Bad and the Queen, as well as a close friend and collaborator on other projects like Rocket Juice & the Moon. Albarn tweeted out a short video of Allen performing in concert captioned “There is no end,” following news of Allen’s death. “The track was written and recorded with Skepta in London just before lockdown and is being shared immediately as a tribute to the spirit of a great man, Tony Allen,” the band shared in a press release. “How Far?” is the latest single in the band’s “Song Machine” series.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gorillaz have paid homage to Tony Allen with a new song called “How Far.” The track features the late drummer, as well as English rapper Skepta.
“The track was written and recorded with Skepta in London just before lockdown and is being shared immediately as a tribute to the spirit of a great man, Tony Allen,” Gorillaz wrote in a statement.
The band also shared some inspiring words from the Afrobeat pioneer: “I want to take care of youngsters, they have messages and I want to bring them on my beat.”
Listen to “How Far” below.
Allen passed away on Thursday (April 30) at the age of 79. He was known for his work with Fela Kuti, and in his later years became a frequent collaborator and good friend to Gorillaz’ Damon Albarn. The two made music together as The Good, The Bad & The Queen, along with The Clash bassist Paul Simonon.
He also drummed on a project called Rocket Juice & The Moon with Albarn and Flea. The Red Hot Pepper bassist wrote a touching tribute to Allen on Instagram after hearing of his death. He called him his “hero” and “one of the greatest drummers to ever walk this earth.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Editor Rating: VERY HOTTTTTUser Rating: n/a - 0% (0)
The world of music faced another tragic death this week after it was announced that legendary Afropop drummer Tony Allen passed away. Allen was revolutionary in helping pioneer the Afrobeats sound, though his musical resume expanded into other genres. Allen and Gorillaz' Damon Albarn were also in the supergroup The Good, the Bad and the Queen together that dabbled into rock, reggae, and dub.
In tribute to Allen, Gorillaz released their new single, "How Far?" which features Tony Allen and Skepta. The song was recorded in recent times, prior to the global lockdown. "The track was written and recorded with Skepta in London just before lockdown and is being shared immediately as a tribute to the spirit of a great man, Tony Allen,” it reads in a press release.
Allen died this week after suffering a heart attack. He worked closely with Fela Kuti who said that "without Tony Allen, there would be no afrobeat".
Check out the track below. RIP Tony Allen.
Quotable LyricsMore money, more problems and more ladiesEveryday somebody dies, still mothers give birth to more babiesThe earth spins, the world gets more crazyYou got to have a suit for the ChristeningA suit for the wedding and a suit for the court caseProbably wear the same suit to the funeralTryna see the bigger picture, man it's bigger than the portrait

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Afrobeat legend Tony Allen sadly passed away earlier this week at age 79, and as a tribute to him, Damon Albarn (who Tony played with in The Good The Bad and The Queen) released a song that he and Allen recorded with Skepta shortly before quarantine began. As Pitchfork points out, a press release states, “The track was written and recorded with Skepta in London just before lockdown and is being shared immediately as a tribute to the spirit of a great man, Tony Allen.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sherlyn Chopra, who is known as one of the boldest, breathtaking and controversial divas in the Indian showbiz, has recently opened up about all her controversies, lifestyle and sex appeal.
The 36-year-old diva has always managed to stay in limelight with bold and nude pictures on her social media handles. Recently, she mocked another controversy queen, Rakhi Sawant in an interview with IBTimes.
In an interview, when Sherlyn was asked about who has the least sex appeal in the industry, she said, "I don't know!!! I guess, Rakhi Sawant. I'm just kidding! Hope she doesn't kill me!"
Sherlyn Chopra is the first woman to have posed nude for the cover of an adult American magazine. When asked it, Sherlyn said, "Most perceptions are fickle and frivolous. The thing that I value the most is genuineness. I've never pretended or claimed to be somebody who I am not. There is sincerity & honesty in my craft which I truly treasure."
Nowadays, celebrities try to impress their fans with their sex appeal. But Sherlyn Chopra has a different take on it. She said, "For me, sex appeal is 99 per cent mental and 1 per cent physical. There are so many people who have great physiques but uninspiring personalities. It's a sad situation."
Sherlyn Chopra often shares her nude pictures on social media for which she gets various kind of replies. Speaking about the same, Sherlyn said, "Now, I live to please myself. I shoot pics & videos to entertain myself and when I share the same with the world, not only do they appreciate it but also pay a price to watch my premium content on the Sherlyn Chopra App."
After sharing nude pictures, Sherlyn Chopra often receives derogatory comments. When asked about how she deals with it, Sherlyn said, "My late father had taught me to never take anything personally from people whom I don't know personally. So, I simply refuse to give my attention to naysayers. As a matter of fact, most naysayers are unemployed, bored, frustrated and dejected and they love to constantly engage in unnecessary hostile and combative interactions with strangers."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3 (UPI) -- John Lafia, a musician, screenwriter and filmmaker known for his work on the Child's Play horror franchise, has died, his family said. He was 63.
The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner's office told Variety the cause was suicide.
Deadline.com said he hanged himself in his basement.
"It is with great sadness we announce that loving father, film and television writer, director, producer and musician John J. Lafia passed away on Wednesday," Lafia's family said in a statement.
His longtime friend and collaborator Don Mancini tweeted out photos of them -- and the demonic doll Chucky -- from the Child's Play sets.
"RIP @JohnLafia LOVE YOU ALWAYS," Mancini tweeted.
"We're devastated to hear of the passing of our friend John Lafia," Mancini said in a longer statement.
"He was a crucial part of the Chucky family from the very beginning. He co-wrote the original Child's Play script along with director Tom Holland and myself, and John directed Child's Play 2 -- the consensus favorite film among Chucky fans. John was an incredibly generous artist. He let me tag along with him to every meeting, and shadow him on set; he taught me more about film-making during the production of that movie than several semesters in film school. John was also one of the most naturally curious and constantly creative people I ever met, someone who was always taking pictures, and jotting down ideas."
Lafia's other credits include The Blue Iguana, Space Raiders, Repo Man, Man's Best Friend, The Rats and Firestorm: Last Stand at Yellowstone.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scrubs star Sam Lloyd’s wife has broken her silence after the actor’s death. He was diagnosed with brain cancer last year, and fans were very saddened to learn of his passing. The 56-year-old’s wife Vanessa Lloyd issued a statement to The Wrap about her husband. They had been battling the disease and Scrubs producer Tom Hobert and his wife had set up a GoFundMe campaign for the actor. The tumor was inoperable, and fans pitched in to help in the fight with that wretched disease. Lloyd’s agent confirmed the news with the press yesterday. Multiple cast members have also tweeted out their feelings after working with the actor on the beloved series.
“Sam passed away peacefully at 10:30 on April 30, 2020 as a result of complications from lung cancer,” her statement begins. “Our family is devastated. It doesn’t feel real. It never will. It just feels like he will walk through the door.”
“The overwhelming outpouring of love and sharing your stories about working with or knowing Sam keeps his memory alive and our hearts strong,” she continues. “Sam loved his work. I want to continue his legacy, and hope to share some of the beautiful songs he was working on for his musical and our son, Weston.”
Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence tweeted a message of remembrance for Lloyd. "Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many." Lloyd's other appearances as his Scrubs character actually came in another Lawrence created series, the Courteney Cox fronted Cougar Town.
Zach Braff was the star of Scrubs and he tweeted about Lloyd as well, saying: "Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
Lloyd appeared in 95 episodes of Scrubs during the show’s run on NBC and ABC. He’s had more than 60 credits over the course of his career. So many television shows that are fan favorites have seen appearances from Lloyd. These include: Modern Family, Spin City, Seineld, Happy Together, Desperate Housewives, Shameless and more.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zach Braff leads tributes to Scrubs co-star Sam Lloyd following his death aged 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tributes have been paid to actor Sam Lloyd, who was best known for playing lawyer Ted Buckland on medical comedy Scrubs, following his death at the age of 56.
In January 2019,  the actor informed fans he had been diagnosed with cancer of the brain and lungs.
Sam announced the news about his health just a month after welcoming a son named Weston with his wife, Vanessa.
Sam’s co-stars from the popular comedy series took to social media to pay heartfelt tributes to him after the tragic news of his death broke yesterday.
Zach Braff, who played John ‘JD’ Dorian in Scrubs, wrote on Twitter: "Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I've ever had the joy of working with.
“Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together.”
He added: "He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
Bill Lawrence, creator of Scrubs, tweeted: "Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many."
Sam’s co-star Robert Maschio penned: “Simpler times, happier days, the kindest man I ever met.
“Easy going Sam, Rest In Peace. #RIPSamLloyd.”
After Sam was diagnosed with cancer, the cast and crew of Scrubs supported him by launching a GoFundMe page to help him in his fight against the disease.
The page was updated in March to share news about Sam celebrating his young son’s first birthday.
The post, updated by Scrubs writer Tim Hobert, read: "In the 13 months since Sam’s original diagnosis, with help from you guys (incredible people from all over the world), he has made the most of the time that he has been given.
"He was able to go back to his home state of Vermont and play his annual gig with his Beatles band, The Butties.
"He was able to do guest spots on Modern Family and American Housewife that allowed him to qualify for the Screen Actors Guild insurance policy.”
The post continued: “He was able to spend time with dear friends, help his mother in the last stages of her life, and sing for her at her funeral, and most importantly, he was able to spend time with his wife, Vanessa, and celebrate Weston’s first birthday!"
The GoFundMe page raised over $150,000 towards the actor's medical bills.
Sam had begun to suffer headaches and after losing 10lbs and with the headaches continuing, he decided to get a CT scan.
The scan revealed a mass on his brain and he was taken in to have brain surgery, but the tumour was unfortunately too intertwined, so the surgeons couldn’t remove it.
Sam and his wife were then told by doctors that the cancer in his brain had metastasized from his lungs. Further scans showed the cancer was also in his liver, spine, and jaw.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sam Lloyd wasn't like Ted from Scrubs - he loved his life</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Sam Lloyd may have been best known for playing beaten down lawyer Ted Buckland from Scrubs, but his character could not have been any further from the man the actor was in real life. 
Sam – also known for appearing in the likes of Seinfeld, The West Wing, Desperate Housewives, Flubber and Galaxy Quest – passed away at the age of 56, 16 months after he was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour.
Following the sad new of his death, his former Scrubs co-stars including Zach Braff and Sarah Chalke took to social media to share tributes to the much-loved actor, with the former saying ‘he could not have been a kinder man’.
Zach, who played JD on the show, tweeted: ‘Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together.
‘He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy.’
A man who loved music, hugs, people and to laugh, Sam’s talent as an actor was proven by how well he could transform into someone that was so unlike himself. 
Speaking to news.com.au in September 2015, Sam admitted that playing such a downtrodden character had its pitfalls, with people on the street noticing how ‘well’ he looked out of character.
He said: ‘Very often, when people see me on the streets they would tell me it was great to see me looking so healthy.
‘Then there were people who just wanted to give me hugs because they felt so bad for me. I didn’t mind because I love hugs.’
Despite playing a character that battled depression and lived a difficult life, Sam said in an interview with the University Observer in 2013 that he ‘was able to keep a sense of humour about it, but after a while, you know, I was ready to be happy again.’
Although he found the role ‘tiring’, his optimism and enthusiasm for his career and craft meant that he still loved his job.
‘It was a blast,’ he said, ‘and you know, at the end of the day it was all for the fun, so it was great.’
While he considered himself lucky to have landed a role on such a popular and successful show, Sam also admitted that he was relieved when it was time to hang up Ted’s briefcase: ‘It was really fun, but after a few years of being sad all the time, I just wanted to be happy.’
On a GoFundMe for the actor, his friend Tim Hobert wrote that a new targeted therapy drug that the star had been taking had allowed Sam to share important moments with his family in the last year before his passing, including his only son’s first birthday. 
Tim said: ‘In the 13 months since Sam’s original diagnosis, with help from you guys (incredible people from all over the world), he has made the most of the time that he has been given. He was able to go back to his home state of Vermont and play his annual gig with his Beatles band, The Butties. He was able to do guest spots on Modern Family and American Housewife that allowed him to qualify for the Screen Actors Guild insurance policy.  
‘He was able to spend time with dear friends, help his mother in the last stages of her life, and sing for her at her funeral, and most importantly, he was able to spend time with his wife, Vanessa, and celebrate Weston’s first birthday!’
He also wrote: ‘For 13 months Sam lived life to the fullest, treasuring every moment.
‘He saw his son, Weston, turn 1, he was able to hold his mom’s hand as she took her last breath, and as Sam always loved to say, “he made music along the way.”’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Francesca Farago Thinks This Scene With Harry Jowsey Didn't Make it Into Too Hot to Handle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Francesca Farago and Harry Jowsey were two of the stars on Netflix's hit series Too Hot to Handle. They left the show, which was filmed more than a year ago, as a couple, and with the exception of a short break, they are together today. But, like every reality show, THTH left some good stuff on the cutting room floor, especially where Farago and Jowsey are concerned. In a BuzzFeed video, Farago answered all of fans' "burning questions" about the show, including which scene she wishes Neflix hadn't cut.
"The one thing that I was hoping to see was when Harry asked me to be his girlfriend—it was the night we lost the $20,000—but I think we were naked when that happened ... [and] obviously they can't air [us being] naked when he was asking me to be his girlfriend," she said. "[I wish that] made it, but it's probably a good thing that it didn't make it."
When Farago refers to the "night [they] lost the 20,000," she means the night she and her boyfriend had sex and cost the whole group a significant portion of their collective $100,000 prize. Sorry for the spoilers, but if you haven't watched at this point, then are you ever really going to watch? The pair was able to win back all the money they lost by spending one night together without having sex.
The pair also cost their co-stars $6,000 when they Farago appeared to give Jowsey a blow job under the covers.
"We wanted to make it acceptable to break the rules so that we would have a show, but we also didn’t want to be too much about the money...We felt that $20,000 for sex was big enough, but it was those middle ground things that were a big debate. We eventually settled on $6,000 [for oral sex], but I think that was a bit cheap, as well," Viki Kolar told TheWrap.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Being locked up in quarantine has given people a lot of time to binge watch their favorite TV shows. A TikTok user recently pointed out that when they were watching an episode of Gossip Girl that first aired eight years ago, they noticed a massive wardrobe fail from star Blake Lively (Serena van der Woodsen), and the clip quickly went viral.
TikTok user @skyehanamaikai was watching the episode titled “Portrait of a Lady Alexander,” which is the fourth episode of Season 6, when she noticed the wardrobe slip-up. In the clip, Lively’s character is sitting at a table in a restaurant with Penn Badley’s character, Dan Humphrey. First, the character of Serena is seen wearing a coral-colored Roland Mouret bodycon dress with bare legs.
However, when she gets up and leaves the table, the next shot after the edit comes from a different angle and shows Lively wearing dark sweatpants underneath her dress. On top of that, there is a continuity error because Serena is all of the sudden holding a cell phone and carrying a purse.
Once the clip was posted on TikTok, it racked up more than one million likes immediately.
“I still stan Serena even with her sweats,” commented a fan. Another added: “I am a huge Gossip Girl fan and have probably seen the show more than 15 times. I can’t believe I missed this.”
Some fans shared their theories to explain why they think Lively would have been randomly wearing sweatpants in a scene on Gossip Girl. One person said that based on their own experience, most actors put layers on between takes when it’s cold. Sometimes, they leave them on “if the shot is from the waist up.”
According to Elle Magazine, cameras did catch the Gossip Girl cast wearing sweatpants, coats, and Uggs with their designer clothes in-between takes when they shot the series between 2007 and 2012. Chances are, Lively didn’t think her sweatpants would be in the shot. Still, the purse and phone continuity error has no excuse.
A Gossip Girl reboot has been announced and will be heading to HBO Max. The new streaming service launches at the end of May, but the premiere date for the Gossip Girl reboot has not yet been set. Blake Lively said back in January that she was “not involved” in the new project.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey threw it back 19 years when they reminisced about their time filming The Wedding Planner.
The two starred as romantic opposites in the 2001 comedy and Matthew took to Twitter to remember the good times in his weekly episode of McConaughey Takes.
In the episode, he recalled how he got paid a lot making it and said: ‘I had a lot of fun making that. Jennifer, I always call her quad-threat, what does she not do?
‘She works her backside off, man, on everything. She’s not just “show up and wing it” at all.’
Soon after he posted the clip, Jennifer reposted it and wrote: ‘Let’s do it again soon’ with a winking emoji. 
On 30 April, J Lo posted a throwback Thursday of a scene between the two from the movie.
Two days later, Matthew saw the clip and left us all screaming with joy when he responded: ‘You are more than enough.’
During his weekly clip, the Interstellar actor also discussed how he got chosen for the role, and it was all thanks to a writer’s strike.
Jennifer ‘was already cast [and] they were looking for the male lead’.
He continued: ‘I think we were coming up against a writers strike. So, what that means is the issue was trying to get as many movies made as quickly as possible… the industry needed content.
‘I remember that because I got paid really well.’
The rom-com saw J Lo playing San Francisco’s most successful wedding supplier who ends up falling in love with the groom of one of her weddings.
You know, how it always happens.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Desi Girl Priyanka Chopra is now a global superstar. The actress works both in India and the US and is definitely the best of both the worlds and needless to say, Priyanka has a huge fan following across the world.
Recently, Priyanka Chopra’s fans have been shocked as a man claimed he was the first one to marry the actor, though by mistake. Brandon Schuster introduces himself as a film and TV lover and shared a throwback picture with Priyanka Chopra after he garlanded her while welcoming her at an event and realized it was one of the rituals of a Hindu wedding.
Sharing a picture of himself with Priyanka Chopra, Brandon Tweeted, “I got ‘married’ to Priyanka Chopra in 2014. I put two flower leis on her to welcome her to a ‘green carpet’ event in Tampa. Little did I know that symbolizes ‘marriage’ in Indian culture. The Indian press had a field day with it and I was giving exclusive interviews the next day.”
His reply about Priyanka Chopra being his wife came in response to American TV personality Chrissy Teigen’s tweet in which she asked, “Have you ever been famous but for like 1 minute? a talking head on an infomercial, in the background of a big movie? something u share with people at dinner parties but it’s so stupid..I would like to see it.”
Take a look at the tweets:
While a few fans laughed over the picture. A Priyanka Chopra fan wrote, “Not exactly but haha.” Another commented, “nick is shaking” with several laughing emojis.
For the unversed, Priyanka Chopra is married to American singer-actor Nick Jonas and the couple resides in Los Angeles. The two had tied the knot in a grand wedding ceremony at the Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur in December 2018.
We wonder what Priyanka has to say about these bizarre claims of this man on social media!

Ira took to Instagram where she shared a string of photographs of the virtual premiere.
"And it begins! @zaynmarie I love you to bits and I'm so proud of you and happy for you. Quarantine or not, WW3 or not, bad week or great year, we'll always be there to go through it with you. Through the great and the terrible!" Ira wrote in the caption.
The photograph featured Aamir looking dapper in a suit, while his daughter chose a yellow cotton saree paired with a red blouse.

Gwen and Blake were celebrating in Oklahoma.
Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton were surrounded by family as they celebrated their romantic duet topping the country music charts.
On Friday, Gwen took to Instagram to give her 10.1 million followers an inside look at the party that she and Blake threw to celebrate the incredible success of “Nobody But You.” The sweet love song from Blake’s new album, Fully Loaded: God’s Country, helped Gwen earn an honor that the “Hollaback Girl” singer never could have imagined earlier in her music career, and it’s clear that she’s happy about sitting atop Billboard‘s Country Airplay chart.
Gwen showed the world just how thrilled she is by sharing a Boomerang video of herself and Blake celebrating their accomplishment with a kiss. In the looping clip, Blake came in fast to plant a wet one on his girlfriend’s glossy pink lips. Gwen puckered up and closed her eyes as she and Blake shared a quick smooch.
Gwen looked glamorous as always with her long, dark eyelashes and winged eyeliner. She added a pop of color to her beauty look by using bright blue eyeliner to draw her wings. She was wearing her platinum blond hair down and straight, while the back of Blake’s mullet-in-progress was curled. He had the short sides of his salt-and-pepper hair covered up with one of his green trucker hats.
Gwen shared more footage from the number one party in her Instagram stories. It took place at one of Blake’s properties in Oklahoma. The building had white walls, a kitchen area, dining table, and plenty of seating. Gwen’s videos showed that Blake was wearing a colorful Hawaiian shirt and jeans, while she was dressed in a baggy gray hoodie and a pair of skinny jeans.
The couple was joined by Gwen’s three sons, Kingston 13, Zuma, 11, and Apollo, 6. Other party attendees included Gwen’s brother Todd and his family. Blake previously said that many of Gwen’s family members are staying with them in Oklahoma as they ride out the COVID-19 outbreak. Blake’s sweet hound dog, Betty, also made an appearance in Gwen’s videos.
Gwen and Blake were shown opening small gifts from Todd and his wife, Jenny. Gwen got a selfie neck holder, and Blake was super excited about his multipurpose tool that included a hammer and 17 other folding implements.
Gwen also showed off a poster hanging on the wall. It was a picture of Gwen as a little girl. She was wearing a cowboy hat and holding up two kittens as she smiled at the camera.
“When I grow up, I’m gonna marry Blake Shelton,” the poster read.
Gwen teared up in a few of her videos, and she shared a heartfelt message with her fans about how grateful she is for their support.
“Thank you guys so much for listening to ‘Nobody But You’ and getting us to number one,” Gwen said. “It’s hard for me to take it in, but sending love to you all, and everybody be safe. Love you.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">I had a crush on 2baba for a long time –Mercy Aigbe</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Olajide Samuel
Actress, Mercy Aigbe, has revealed that for a long time, she had a crush on ‘African Queen’ singer, 2baba (formerly 2face Idibia).
Aigbe stated this during the week as a guest on Gbenga Adeyinka’s Instagram Live chat. After Adeyinka played ‘African Queen’ while on the video call, Aigbe said with a broad smile, “Don’t tell anybody o. For a very long time, I had a crush on 2baba.”
The fashionable role interpreter also stated that before she got into the industry, she admired Liz Benson and Sola Sobowale. She said, “Coming into the industry, there were two people I admired a lot— Liz Benson and Sola Sobowale. Liz Benson was just so beautiful and she still is. I absolutely loved her back then. I also loved the way Sola Sobowale interpreted her roles. She inspires me whenever I see her on a movie set.”
Recounting the first encounter she had with Sobowale, Aigbe said, “Before I got into the industry, I admired Sola Sobowale because she knows her onions. One day, I got a call to come on set for a movie titled, ‘Ohun Oko So Mi Da’.
“The movie was produced by Aunty Sola and I was shivering when I got to the set. I asked myself, ‘Would I be able to act in the presence of my role model?’ I went to a corner and prayed to God and told myself, ‘This is my opportunity. I shouldn’t allow Aunty Sola overshadow me. I should let my star shine.’
“Unfortunately for me, in that particular scene, I wasn’t meant to talk at all. I acted the role of her husband’s secretary and was dating her husband. She came to my character’s house to warn her. I was not supposed to say anything but I thought that as an up-and-coming actress, she would just kill my ‘star’ if I didn’t say anything. Guess what I did. I gave myself lines. As she was ranting, I was reacting to her rants. When she held me, I put my hands inside her brassiere. She just told the director to end the scene at that point, asking where they found ‘this kind of girl’.”
The ‘77 Bullets’ actress also maintained that she learnt consistency and doggedness from her mother. She added, “I learnt being dogged from my mum. She is a very strong woman, who never gives up. She is very consistent and hardworking. I believe that whatever one wants to do, one has to keep at it until one succeeds.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Victoria Beckham has shared a heartwarming video montage to celebrate her husband David's 45th birthday today.
The fashion designer, 46, shared the clip this morning showing nostalgic unseen videos and pictures, and had The Doobie Brothers hit Long Train Runnin' playing in the background.
A clip also shows son Brooklyn, 21, surprising his dad for his 43rd birthday.
She also shared a snap in a separate post of the pair walking Rottweilers Snoop and Puffy in Manchester 23 years ago.
The former Spice Girl Victoria captioned her post: "Happy birthday @DavidBeckhamx Remembering our walks with Snoop and Puffy in Manchester all those years ago."
David was also seen in a video with his family walking through Disneyland Florida wearing Mickey Mouse ears on over his black baseball cap.
Cruz and Romeo were also shown playing guitars when they were children.
Another snap shows the Beckham family sat on the front row at one of her fashion shows.
The family were also seen in a throwback pic when they were at the Grand Canyon in the US.
She captioned her sweet montage: "Happy bday to the best daddy. Celebrating in lockdown and missing @brooklynbeckham and all our friends and family today. We all love you so much xxx', she captioned the post."
Many fans rushed to the comments section to send David well wishes.
One wrote: "Many happy returns to the most wonderful David!"
Victoria also shared a picture of a bacon and egg sandwich on her Instagram stories with "love" written in tomato ketchup, which was captioned "happy birthday David Beckham".
This week Victoria reversed her decision to furlough 30 employees at her fashion company after coming under immense criticism.
The entrepreneur, who has a combined fortune of £335 million with husband David, opted to use the government bail out scheme and use tax-payers' money to pay 80% of her staff's wages while they are at home.
However, Posh has now undergone a change of heart after being 'devastated' by the public reaction.
Her fashion brand had earlier sent letters to staff warning them that they were going to be furloughed under the Government's scheme for two months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Victoria Beckham pays sweet birthday tribute to husband David with adorable family video</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VICTORIA Beckham paid a sweet birthday tribute to husband David today as he celebrates turning 45.
The designer put together an adorable family video montage on Instagram featuring loads of cute Beckham moments.
Giving a detailed glimpse into their life over the years, David could be seen being affectionate with his wife as well as being a doting dad to their four kids.
Victoria's first snap was a throwback of the pair walking their dogs Snoop and Puffy in Manchester in 1997.
She wrote: "Happy birthday @davidbeckham x Remembering our walks with Snoop and Puffy in Manchester all those years ago. Still dog walking together 23 years later. Love you so much x
The video collection followed with a bittersweet caption about how they were missing eldest son Brooklyn, family and friends in lockdown.
On her Instagram stories, Victoria shared a picture of David's birthday breakfast: a bacon and egg sarnie with ketchup.
His presents were covered in wrapping paper with his face on for an extra personal touch.
David's kids also wished him well, with Romeo writing: ""Happy birthday dad I love you so so so so much and hope you have the best day ♥️sorry for being officially taller than you now 😂♥️."
While Cruz posted: "Dad, I love you so much happy birthday have a great day ❤️❤️❤️."
The tribute comes a day after Victoria made a U-turn - and pledged to reverse her decision to furlough staff.
The star has decided against a government bail-out following a furious backlash from the public.
News of her change of heart comes after the Sun on Sunday revealed the 46-year-old designer’s company was using Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s scheme to furlough 25 members of staff - despite being boasting a family worth of £335million.
A source added: “Victoria is devastated about the backlash she’s faced.
“The original decision to furlough wasn’t actually hers - it was more a board thing, and she was persuaded that it was the right thing to do. Obviously she now realises this is wrong.
“Victoria realises she still has some way to go when it comes to endearing herself again with the great British public, but she is going to use her position and influence to start giving more back.”
The former Spice Girl, married to ex-England captain David, has had a relatively rough few months.
Her business empire has taken numerous hits, and in November it emerged the company had recorded losses of over £12million.
She has also made dramatic cuts to the business empire, slashing her own salary and even losing the use of her chauffeur.
Since its formation in 2008, it has made losses of around £35million - despite boasting celebrity fans including Michelle Obama, Cara Delevingne, Jennifer Lopez and Meghan Markle.
And after news of her decision to furlough staff emerged - albeit on an ‘enhanced package’ - social media was flooded with scathing comments.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4"> 
 
It was recently reported that Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Hrithik Roshan, Karan Johar and Zoya Akhtar among many other celebrities have collaborated for a from-home concert ‘I For India’, with an intention to raise funds for the battle against Covid-19. Varun Dhawan too is a part of this noble initiative and Koimoi has some interesting details about his performance.
The Four-hour long concert which will be streamed on Facebook on May 3, will feature Varun Dhawan in an around 5-minute long video alongside approximately 140 dance instructors from Shiamak Davar’s Institute. “The instructors participating from all over the world including Dubai, Vancouver and Toronto, will dance on a medley of songs. Varun will appear by the end of the video grooving on ‘Mile Sur Mera Tumhara’ from Street Dancer 3D. He was really excited to be a part of this initiative,” informs a source close to the development.
Confirming the news Shiamak told Koimoi, “Varun Dhawan has been our SDIPA (Shiamak Davar’s Institute for the Performing Arts) student and we share a great bond. When it came to this cause, we felt it would be fitting to have all my instructors dance in their homes from their countries and we then have Varun dancing here. It’s turned out to be a power packed performance and I am sure everyone will appreciate the effort and the cause too.”
Apart from Varun Dhawan, other celebs who are a part of this initiative, includes Akshay Kumar, Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Bryan Adams, Lilly Singh, Mindy Kaling, Will Smith, Nick Jonas, Anushka Sharma, Virat Kohli, AR Rahman, Aditya Roy Kapur, Anil Kapoor, Arijit Singh and Rani Mukerji among others.
Ever since the beginning of the lockdown, celebrities have been doing their bit to help the country during the coronavirus pandemic. Besides donating for several causes in connection to the outbreak, Akshay Kumar & Jackky Bhagnani in early April had released a motivating song ‘Muskurayega India’ and had followed it up with a new version of Teri Mitti from the 2019 historical film, Kesari, as a tribute to the healthcare workers of our country.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wish you come back to life like you reincarnated in Karz: Lata Mangeshkar remembers Rishi Kapoor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar wishes that the story of Subhash Ghai’s 1980 blockbuster Karz turns out to be true in real-life as she wants veteran actor Rishi Kapoor to come back.
Rishi died on Thursday at HN Reliance hospital in Mumbai after a two year long battle with leukaemia.
In an innocent and heartfelt tweet, Mangeshkar said Rishi’s character was reincarnated after his death in Karz and she wants the same to happen in reality as well.
“Rishi ji we are missing you so much and we will always remember you. It will be foolish of me to think this but I wish you come back to life like how you did in your film Karz. It will be so nice to see you back,” the 90-year-old singer said.
Lata Mangeshkar also posted a video of Karz song “Om Shanti Om” along with her post.
Karz is about a man (Rishi), who is murdered by his wife, only to be reborn as a new person and takes his revenge from her.
On Thursday, Lata Mangeshkar had shared a black-and-white photo of Rishi as a toddler to mourn his death.
“A few days back Rishi had sent me this picture of us. I am remembering all those days and the conversations we had. I am short of words. What should I say? I can’t express the pain through words. I am in immense sorrow due to the demise of Rishi Kapoor. The film industry has suffered a huge loss due to his departure. It is very difficult for me to go through this pain. May God grant peace to his soul,” she had said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rishi Kapoor’s demise has put people across the country in a state of shock. The actor spent most of last year in New York undergoing cancer treatment and when he made his return to India, people felt that things were going back to normal. However, the sudden turn of events have left fans of cinema absolutely devastated.
Neeetu Kapoor is someone who’s always been by his side through the ups and downs in life. We cannot even imagine the pain she’s going through right now but instead of being in a constant state of grief, the former is actress celebrating Rishi Kapoor’s life in typical Rishi Kapoor fashion. Earlier today, Neetu Kapoor took to social media and shared a picture of Rishi Kapoor where he’s seen lifting a drink with a smile on his face. Neetu Kapoor’s caption for the picture read, “End Of Our Story”. Take a look at the picture below.
Even though we might not see Rishi Kapoor on the big screen again, his contribution to Bollywood will always remain in our hearts. He was a true legend in every sense and shall never be forgotten.

Hrithik Roshan took to his Instagram handle to write a lengthy note about how much impact Rishi Kapoor had on his life. Hrithik shared the touching tribute along with a candid photo of him, Rishi and Neetu Kapoor. Take a look.
"Even your love had so much energy that I had to stand at attention every time you called. .I don't think I have ever in my life been able to continue sitting down when you spoke to me .," started Hrithik.
He continued, "Everytime dad called and said "chintu uncle just saw your movie and he is calling you ", I used to get up, heart palpitating and start walking around in the room , preparing myself for the deluge of love and reprimand mixed so genuinely together in your own inimitable way that it was difficult for an observer to distinguish which was which. You gave me strength at my weakest moments. It felt so god damn amazing to think that Rishi Kapoor liked my work. That It made me believe in myself."
He further wrote, "Thank you for every time you picked up the phone and took the effort , thank you for repeatedly pointing out my mistakes , thank you for that consistent support and encouragement chintu uncle, there will never be any actor or human like you. Thank you for being my childhood , for literally shouting out loud into my ear drums about the importance of hard work. And for being so blatantly and ridiculously honest that it made me believe every single word you ever said . I and the world and everyone you touched and inspired is going to miss you. So so much . ❤️" (sic).
Hrithik shared screen space with Rishi in the 2012 film Agneepath, which was directed by Karan Malhotra and produced by Dharma Productions.

Hania Amir is a Pakistani film and television actress, model and singer as well who was born on 11th February 1997 in Rawalpindi and she is only 23 years old. She has the nickname honey. Hania used to make several dub smashes and uploaded them on her social media account, which got the attention of the producer Imran Kazmi, who later cast her in a supporting role in the romantic comedy Janaan.
Hania belongs to a very decent family background from Punjab. Her father is from Murree and wholeheartedly supports his daughter in her career while her mother is a household woman. She has only a sister Eesha who is five years younger than her and is still studying.
Hania Amir was studying at the Foundation for Advancement of Science and Technology (FAST-NUCES), when she got auditioned for the romantic comedy Janaan (2016), a film produced by the debutante filmmaker Imran Kazmi. The film received a positive response and was a commercial success. Her role of mischievous Pashtun women was highly appreciated and so she got Lux Style Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination.
Moreover, Hania subsequently starred as a beauty-obsessed unfaithful wife in the 2017 romantic television series Title. This amazing series was the contemporary adaption of the novel Beauty and the Beast and got aired on Urdu 1. This project marked awesome success and made Hania have a boost in her popularity and a wide scope of public recognition.
Apart from that, her performance in the romantic drama Phir Wohi Mohabbat (2017), made her earn the Best Television Sensation Female at the Hum Awards. The same year, she played an impulsive bride-to-be in the heist comedy Na Maloom Afraad 2. The following year, the ways opened again for her and she got featured in Parwaaz Hai Junoon. Like that of her previous project, it also emerged as a major critical and commercial success and both the films rank among the highest-grossing Pakistani films.
Hania also portrayed a girl next door in the ARY Digital’s melodrama Visaal (2018). After playing a comic role in the telefilm Band Toh Baje Ga (2018), she played the free-spirited heiress of a fictional city Shergarh in the romantic television series Anaa (2019), one of the highest-rated television series of the year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Stars and their star kids have their way of doing things in Bollywood which is almost unthinkable down in the South Film Industries. Tiger Shroff is quite a known name even to our audiences, though we know very little about his sister Krishna Shroff.
Krishna Shroff who always has been a free-spirited girl shared a picture of herself on Instagram. She was kissing her boyfriend Eban Hyams while she remained topless wearing a skimpy mini skirt. The guy’s face was well hidden, though.
This isn’t the first time she did something bold like this. Krishna Shroff has a history of sharing romantic pictures and videos of herself. Tiger Shroff and Krishna Shroff happen to be veteran actor Jackie Shroff’s children.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">They say motherhood is nothing less than a bliss for a woman. However, what they don’t say are the struggles that come along with it. There’s no denying that raising a kid makes a woman feel complete in a very beautiful way, but there are little struggles that come along the tiny troublemakers. For example, giving mom a tough time with a series of dirty nappies, and this is exactly what Kalki Koechlin is going through.
Sharing a post of her few months old toddler Sappho’s smudged nappies, Kalki wrote - “Three in a row, in the space of five minutes😝 #shitgetsreal #parenting #clothnappies”.
This cracked up a number of social media users. One user wrote - “This is just the beginning😜. Enjoy your motherhood. 😍”, while another posted - “I can totally relate. It's good that it's not your hand or your clothes. I have faced far worse! 😂 But, this too shall pass!!! 😁. And since people could relate to, one of the users wrote - “Lol welcome to the bandwagon❤️” Earlier, Kalki posted a video of her strumming the ukulele and singing a Portuguese lullaby to Sappho, who was enjoying her laid back time in the cradle. That video too gave mommy goals and made the internet fall in love with Kalki.

There were rumours about Krishna’s secret marriage with Eban after he addressed her as ‘wifey’ in his Instagram stories. During the recent chat with Mumbai mirror, she opened up about it and said, “hilarious, just a term. And it’s crazy how there are so many articles saying we were secretly married. Even my mum asked me what was going on.”
Opening about Eban, Krishna revealed that she met him through a common friend whom she was meeting after a long time. She was quoted as saying, “I was catching up with a friend of his whom I hadn’t met in a long time, but eventually ended up chatting with Eban. Eban and Tiger have played basketball together but he never knew that Tiger has a sister.”
Talking about family’s response on their relationship, she stated that they will be involved but for now they are trying to spend more and more time together. She said, “They don’t interfere much, they trust my judgement. Families eventually do get involved, but I’d like to take my time and keep it between us for now.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Not just child's play! Mother delights in dressing up her one-year-old daughter in HILARIOUS costumes to recreate famous movie scenes - including Kill Bill and Hellboy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A baby girl is recreating famous movie and TV scenes - including Die Hard and Silence of the Lambs.
Evie Simpson wears a variety of costumes, wigs, makeup and props to copy clips from The Matrix, Hellboy, Breaking Bad and Kill Bill.
Her mum Jessica Simpson, 32, a business manager from Indian Queens, Cornwall, started the photoshoots as a joke for family and friends, but now spends hours making the perfect setting for her shots.
She uses her daughter, Evie, who is twenty-months-old, to pose as the actors with the versatile tot pulling off roles of household names from Uma Thurman in Kill Bill to the Anthony Hopkins serial killer.
In one image, young Evie can be seen crawling towards the camera just like Bruce did in the 1988 action film.
In another, dressed as the infamous Hannibal Lecter, Evie is snarling at the camera while holding a knife and fork.
She has also reprised Gerard Butler's role as Leonidas in cartoon-epic 300, complete with a six-pack and abs drawn on with make up.
Other film roles she has stared in have included The Matrix and Hellboy. 
And she has also been Tom Hanks, Marilyn Monroe and Emilia Clarke as Daenarys Targaryen from Game of Thrones - complete with white hair, astride a dragon.
In addition to the movie scenes, Evie has also played the roles of singers including Madonna and Britney Spears.
Jessica started it as a joke but her family and friends love it, regularly sending her messages asking for the next instalment.
She said: 'I'd seen something similar online, I think someone was doing book characters. 
'It was just supposed to be a laugh but it went down really well.
'It feels to me like they're really hashed together but I get lots of messages asking for the next one.'
Jessica creates a new image each month, and every time the new subject is a closely guarded secret until the big reveal.
It started last year, when the mum-of-two dressed up her eldest child as celebrities who were enjoying their birthday that month. 
She added: 'That's how it started, but now we're focusing on movie scenes. We have just done Bruce Willis in Die Hard.
'I got a box from work and lined it with tin foil, then I got a battery powered tea light and made it look like a lighter.
'I had to dirty up one of her vests and put some eye liner on her face to look like stubble.'
Jessica added: 'We've also done Marilyn Monroe, Gerard Butler, and Tom Hanks.
'Now we're doing scenes from movies, we've done Trinity in The Matrix and Hellboy.'
She explained: 'I jot down ideas when I get them but I don't plan too much. I look at what films have been released that month and pick my favourite.
'The one for next month is planned, but that's it. I can't tell you what it is, it's a secret.'

He has also been doing his own make-up for This Morning because of social distancing restrictions.
ITV bosses have pledged to keep This Morning on air “for as long as possible”.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Phillip Schofield has taken to Instagram to show off his wildly different lockdown hair choices.
In one picture he showed off slick back and styled hairdoo, while in another his silver hair was sticking up and unkempt.
The TV personality wore a smart polo shirt in the black and white pic of his slick look while in the other he grimaced as his mop spiked in all directions.
And fans of the presenter who wrote with his snap: "Lockdown hair options" had mixed opinions about his wacky hair styles.
One wrote: "The second wild look!!."
Another said: "Silver fox, followed by two flame emojis."
A fan wrote: "Wow Phillip! Rocking them hair styles."
Another added: "I like the nutty professor look!"
While other fans were not as impressed with Phillip's lockdown hair choices.
One wrote: "Cut it all offfffffff."
Another said: "How many likes on this comment for you to shave it all off."
The This Morning host also posted his smart hair style on his Instagram stories, captioning it: "If ya can't cut it, slick it."
Philtook to his Instagram earlier this week to share the same snap of is unkempt hair.
In the pic Phil appeared to be sitting in a balcony area on on a plush grey sofa in his new place.
The pic was taken from his new bachelor pad where he moved to after moving out of the home he shared with his wife Steph when he came out as gay earlier this year.
Phillip admitted that he 'misses hugs' after moving out of the £2million family home on Monday's episode of This Morning.
He also this week opened up on how This Morning going ahead amid the coronavirus lockdown allowed him to keep positive mentally.
He said: "It's very good for the head isn't it. I think this has saved my head actually, being able to come in here and keep going."
Later on in the show, Phillip shared important advice as he encouraged one tearful viewer to remain positive during the unusual situation of lockdown.
He said: "You've got to think positive, it's a time where we are all trying to find a silver lining in what is a very dark cloud... we will all get through this."=

    <h5 class="mb-1">Phillip Schofield has given up on lockdown routine as he shows off unruly hair</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Phillip Schofield has given up on his usual styling routines like the rest of us and showed off his new hair.
The This Morning host debuted his unruly mane, looking rather similar to Dr. Emmett ‘Doc’ Brown from Back To The Future.
Sharing a side-by-side picture to his Instagram, the 58-year-old captioned the post: ‘Lockdown hair options.’
One of the photos had Phillip slick his hair back with gel and all he’s missing is a tuxedo.
Of course, the snap had to be black and white to add to the suave effect.
Fans found the two styles hilarious, leaving jokes under his post.
One fan made the perfect comparison, stating: ‘Is that like Tom Hardy vs Boris Johnson.’
However, some weren’t too appreciative of the slicked back look, writing: ‘Deffo the second look!😂😂’
Or maybe this comparison is more accurate: ‘Richard Gere V Freddie Boswell 🤣 ❤️ u Phil.’
The talk show host has been isolating in his new flat, after being spotted moving out of his £2 million family home after coming out as gay.
However, Phillip and Holly Willoughby continue filming This Morning from the studio.
And ITV boss Kevin Lygo has plans in place if the coronavirus pandemic ever forces the show out of ITV studios.
Holly and Phil have been equipped with expensive cameras in their respective homes so they can continue filming the day time TV show as normal.
Lygo said: ‘When it looked that lockdown was coming, I quickly went into what are our priorities here, what are the main things ITV should be doing?
‘I prioritised quite early the news and the regional news, we have to keep them on air, they must continue broadcasting for a long as possible.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">You Should Probably Skip Buying a New Xbox or PlayStation This Year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Now that both Sony and Microsoft have released the official specs of their upcoming consoles, there’s plenty to get excited about this coming holiday season – maybe. In a recent interview with CNBC, Microsoft Xbox chief Phil Spencer said that, while he expects Xbox Series X production to remain on schedule, the covid-19 pandemic may delay games from launching on the new console at the same time of its release.
As of now, Microsoft has only officially committed to launching Halo Infinite alongside the Xbox Series X, according to The Verge.Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 is another Microsoft first-party title with a release date of December 2020. So far, there have been no reports of delays, but that is one of the games Spencer was referencing, along with Observer (System Redux), Outriders, and Gods and Monsters, which all currently have Xbox Series X release dates for holiday 2020.
The biggest problem, Spencer said, is that developers are now working remotely. That adds new challenges to the entire game development process, like sharing extremely large files over home internet connections that might not be the fastest. (Thank goodness many ISPs have waived data caps.) If enough games get delayed on either platform, there might not be much of a reason to rush out and buy the latest and greatest consoles. (And maybe wait to upgrade your PC, too.)
A few high-profile games on other consoles were delayed before the pandemic hit. Cyberpunk 2077 was supposed to come out last month, but developer CD Projekt Red delayed that to Sept. 17. Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 was supposed to launch in the first quarter of this year (by the end of March), but creator Hardsuit Labs pushed that back until some later, unannounced date. It’s possible that those companies could have to push the games back further due to the pandemic, but neither have publicly said anything. Neither title is an Xbox Series X nor PlayStation 5 exclusive, though, and CD Projekt Red hasn’t said whether or not Cyberpunk 2077 will be available on the PS5 (though it is definitely coming to the Series X).
Game developer Naughty Dog said last month it was delaying the release of The Last of Us 2 “indefinitely” on the PlayStation. The game was originally set to come out in February, but was then delayed to May. The covid-19 pandemic made the logistics of continuing work on the game difficult. However, after a recent major leak of game content, Naughty Dog set a new release date for June 19. Whether or not it will actually come out on that date remains to be seen.
If it does, that’s one reason to pick up a PlayStation 5 at the end of this year, assuming it comes out according to schedule. If the consoles don’t debut by the end of the year, it will almost definitely result in a massive loss of holiday sales for both companies. But even if both consoles debut on time, and if there’s a decent spread of games available, how many of those titles will actually utilise the consoles’ ray tracing capabilities? We’ve seen what ray tracing looks like with Minecraft on the Xbox Series X, and Square Enix released a demo video of what ray tracing could look like for more graphically intensive games on the Xbox Series X and PS5. But we’ve heard nothing but crickets when it comes to which games will be available with ray tracing on both consoles at launch.
Bloober Team did recently release a sneak peak of all the changes it made to its 2017 game Observer, which includes ray tracing. (There’s a lovely fan-made comparison video here.) If that’s indeed what ray tracing will look like on the Xbox Series X and PS5, then great. But again, will it be ready in time?
It could be a similar situation to Nvidia’s initial release of its RTX graphics cards; there were only one or two games at the time that supported it at launch, but there has been a slow, steady increase in ray tracing-compatible games since then.Cyberpunk 2077 and Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2will both have ray tracing on PC when released, so they should on the new consoles, too.
If Cyberpunk 2077 hits its September release date and is available for the Series X when that console launches, that could be enough of a reason for current Xbox owners to upgrade – at least those who care about ray tracing on console games. (No judgement; I bought the PS4 just because I wanted to play Detroit: Become Human, and there was nothing all that special about that console.) That leaves the PS5 out in the cold graphics-wise since we haven’t seen any sneak peaks or even confirmation about ray tracing games for the upcoming console. But its SSD storage upgrades, a custom 825GB SSD running on a PCIe 4.0 interconnect, and the ability to use off-the-shelf SSDs to expand storage space, will definitely come in handy for The Last of Us 2, which takes up a massive 100GB.

If that’s indeed what ray tracing will look like on the Xbox Series X and PS5, then great. But again, will it be ready in time?
It could be a similar situation to Nvidia’s initial release of its RTX graphics cards; there were only one or two games at the time that supported it at launch, but there has been a slow, steady increase in ray tracing-compatible games since then. Cyberpunk 2077 and Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2 will both have ray tracing on PC when released, so they should on the new consoles, too.
If Cyberpunk 2077 hits its September release date and is available for the Series X when that console launches, that could be enough of a reason for current Xbox owners to upgrade—at least those who care about ray tracing on console games. (No judgment; I bought the PS4 just because I wanted to play Detroit: Become Human, and there was nothing all that special about that console.) That leaves the PS5 out in the cold graphics-wise since we haven’t seen any sneak peaks or even confirmation about ray tracing games for the upcoming console. But its SSD storage upgrades, a custom 825GB SSD running on a PCIe 4.0 interconnect, and the ability to use off-the-shelf SSDs to expand storage space, will definitely come in handy for The Last of Us 2, which takes up a massive 100GB.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Unannounced Third-Party Xbox Series X Games to Be Shown Next Week, Insider Says; Microsoft’s Summer ‘E3’ Event Will be a “Big Blowout” for XGS</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unannounced third-party titles will be shown off during Microsoft’s special Inside Xbox episode next week, according to reputable industry insider Shinobi.
Several rumors already hinted at it, and some days ago, Microsoft officially confirmed that it’s planning a special episode of Inside Xbox next week. During the broadcast, Microsoft will be showing off new gameplay of third-party titles running on the Xbox Series X.
Gears Tactics Review – The Perfect Use of Chest-High Walls
As confirmed by Ubisoft, the recently revealed Assassin’s Creed Valhalla will show up, but other than that, we will have to wait and see what the Inside Xbox episode has in store for us. Are we going to see gameplay from yet to be announced third-party games? If reputable insider Shinobi is to be believed, this will indeed be the case.
When asked about it on the ResetEra forums, the insider answered with a clear “yes”. As hinted at by Shinobi, there’s also the possibility that publisher EA will be showing some gameplay for its upcoming titles running on Microsoft’s next-gen console, but this is merely speculation at this point. “I wouldn't say...nothing", Shinobi said when another Resetera user mentioned that EA has no upcoming games for this Fall.
Aside from next week’s third-party showcase, it appears that Microsoft is planning a second digital event that will focus on its first-party titles, and according to Shinobi, this event will be a “big blowout” for Xbox Game Studios.
“I genuinely don't know *everything* that will be there, to be transparent, but I know of several third parties”, he said. “Their 'E3' event is where XGS will get a big blowout.”
As always, we will keep you updated as soon as more info comes in on Microsoft’s Xbox Series X events.
Which third-party titles would you like to see unveiled during next week’s Inside Xbox episode? What about Microsoft’s first-party ‘E3’ event? Hit the comments down below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In a world sitting on edge, a yellow house sits on ice</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Little did Emilia Memory know what was to come when she placed a yellow house on the edge of an iceberg.
How her final year of secondary school would turn out. That her resulting artwork would end up being shown by Brisbane's Gallery of Modern Art. And that the piece would be shown virtually, as the world was plunged into a new unknown - brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.
Ms Memory became one of 33 Queensland senior high school recipients of the annual Creative Generation Excellence Awards in visual art.
The Lourdes Hill College graduate said she had no intention of her artwork going “anywhere” until her teacher nominated the piece.
“I drew my first sketch based on where my headspace was at, at the time,” she said.
“It's so surreal. I never would've thought I'd be someone to get into GOMA.”
Ms Memory took the sketch-turned-installation a step further and photographed the work.
She drew inspiration from artist James Casebere and architect Ricardo Bofill as well as National Geographic photographs.
“At some point in a person’s life, they will confront places, people, things or situations that are foreign to them,” she said.
“It could be moving to a new house, starting a new job or changing schools.”
Ms Memory said uncertainty and fear crept in at the time of creation because she was beginning her first term in her final year of schooling.
“It’s crazy that we’re talking about the theme of the unknown, where we are now, living during the pandemic,” she said.
“What I learnt in my final year was that everything will work itself out.”
Ms Memory is now studying a nursing diploma but continues to create art during her spare time.
“I really want to get into fashion someday and somehow,” she said.
“I honestly feel blessed and this exhibition is such a great opportunity that I hope it can open new avenues for me as well.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jake Gyllenhaal Joins Will Ferrell, Kristen Wiig & Jimmy Fallon In Another Episode Of ‘The Longest Days Of Our Lives’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig returned to “The Tonight Show” Friday to join Jimmy Fallon for a third edition of their bonkers soap opera “The Longest Days of Our Lives”.
During the previous episode, Wiig’s character, Vanessa, revealed she’d become pregnant through Zoom, with either love interest (Winston) or his long-lost brother Fontaine (Ferrell) the father.
In this episode, however, the baby had already arrived. “Apparently when you’re pregnant on Zoom, you really zoom through the pregnancy,” Wiig said, and introduced the men to her son, Blake, played by surprise guest star Jake Gyllenhaal.
Blake is already grown, because he’s “zooming through life,” and blasts his potential fathers for missing his big game, his big recital and his graduation. Asked how he was able to participate in all those milestones with everything happening right now, Blake replied, “There’s a lot you can do over Zoom, if you’re willing to have everything look and sound like crap.”
Regardless of who Blake’s father is revealed to be, he declares himself heir to the family fortune — a giant stash of toilet paper — leading to a wacko race around the world as Zoom backgrounds change to such far-flung locales as Mount Rushmore, a chariot race in ancient Rome and the surface of the Moon.
Along the way, viewers also witnessed the shocked reactions of more unexpected guest stars, soap actors Susan Lucci (“All My Children”), Heather Locklear (“Melrose Place”), Maurice Bernard (“General Hospital”) and Mary Beth Evans (“Day of Our Lives”).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Grey’s Anatomy fans got a sweet surprise this week when alum Eric Dane revealed on Instagram that he had reunited with his former co-star Patrick Dempsey while practicing social distancing amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Dane – who played Dr. Mark Sloan, aka McSteamy – starred on the ABC medical drama from 2006 to 2012. Dempsey was an original cast member who played the role of Dr. Derek Shepherd, aka McDreamy, from 2005 to 2015.
In the pic, Dane and Demspey were enjoying the outdoors somewhere in Los Angeles with big smiles on their faces and plenty of distance between them.
“Blurry pic of how to hang out 6 feet apart,” wrote Dane in the caption.
Many of Dane’s 1.9 million Instagram followers expressed their joy over the photo, including one fan who was inspired to rewatch all 16 seasons of Grey’s Anatomy from the beginning.
“Am I dreamin’ or is it steamy out here,” wrote one fan, with another adding: “This is my new favorite picture.”
Dane left Grey’s Anatomy after Season 8, and he told TV Line at the time that he was “extremely grateful” for the people he worked with on the medical drama, and he also noted that it was “wonderful” to work with show creator Shonda Rhimes, who he called a “creative force.”
Dempsey unexpectedly left the series after 11 seasons, and he has not kept in touch with all of his former co-stars. Ellen Pompeo (Meredith Grey) said in 2018 that she hadn’t spoken with Dempsey since he left the show three years earlier.
“I have no hard feelings toward him, he’s a wonderful actor we made, you know, the best TV you could make together,” said Pompeo on Red Table Talk.
Pompeo added that when people typically leave Grey’s Anatomy, they need time to figure out who they are without it because it takes up so much of your life. Even though they hadn’t spoken in years, Pompeo said that she would “always have a place” in her heart for Dempsey, who was her on-screen love interest for a decade.
Currently, Eric Dane stars in the HBO series Euphoria, and Patrick Dempsey has signed on to be the lead character in the upcoming CBS series Ways & Means.

The ITV series aired back in 1998, and followed a group of young witches who attended Miss Cackle’s school for magic. 
Basically Harry Potter in TV show form.
We were so keen to have the OG magic crew on our screens once more that we delved into old episodes – and noticed a very famous face walking around the halls.
Who knew, years before Nancy popped up in Hollyoaks, she was causing chaos in a witch academy?
Actress Jessica Fox starred as Mildred Hubble’s (Georgina Sherrington) best pal Enid Nightshade, who played all kinds of practical jokes on the gang in the hopes of fitting in.
Basically, she was the fun one of the group.
Chatting to Metro.co.uk, Jessica recalled some of her favourite moments from the show – which aired until 2001.
‘It was a really, really fun thing to film. We had such a good time doing it,’ she told us. ‘There was always something mad happening.
‘I loved it when anything got blown up, I found that really exciting. Enid was very naughty, she was always getting into trouble and doing naughty things.
‘I think she blew something up, or she signed off-key on purpose and smashed bottles. And I just remember they had little explosives, and they were made out of a special glass that shatters if you just touch it.
‘Everything was just exploding around me, I remember thinking that was really, really cool.’
It sounds like her time on set for the Worst Witch really set Jessica up well for Hollyoaks – especially with everything blowing up around her.
And, as the 36-year-old faces a major milestone in Chester, she’s thrilled to have another career high to look back on with the ITV series appearing on BritBox.
‘It’s actually really nice,’ she continued. ‘Obviously I’m on Hollyoaks and it will be 15 years this year, it feels like there’s lots of looking back for me at the moment, because there’s quite a lot of milestones happening.
‘It’s nice to revisit and remember all the things that you’ve done. 
‘I was really lucky I started working when I was really little, about seven or eight. It’s nice to look at your back catalogue, and think, “Gosh, didn’t I do a lot?”.’
‘I know that from when people speak to me, their eyes always light up and they go, “I loved the Worst Witch!”,’ she added.
‘It’ll be really nice to hear that again, really. It’s always nice to be told that the programmes you were in were loved.’
The Worst Witch is available on BritBox from 7th May. Visit www.britbox.co.uk to sign up for a 30 day free trial.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Christopher Meloni Returning to 'Law & Order: SVU' in Season 22 Premiere Ahead of New Spinoff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Christopher Meloni will be reprising his role as Elliot Stabler on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit ahead of the upcoming spinoff centered around his character created by longtime producer Dick Wolf. While fans were thrilled last month to learn Meloni would be returning to the Law & Order universe, many wondered if and when he would be reunited with Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson on SVU.
On the latest episode of The Law & Order: SVU Podcast, showrunner Warren Leight revealed that Stabler will be back on their screens sooner rather than later, with his first appearance on the SVU Season 22 premiere. “It’s pretty clear that Elliot will be in the SVU season opener,” Leight said, as per Entertainment Tonight. “I think that much I know. Whether we get to see his family as well remains to be seen.”
The original plan for Leight and other writers Julie Martin, Denis Hamill and Monet Hurst-Mendoza was to bring Stabler back with his family gradually. Leight said, "We had heard distant thunder about Chris Meloni coming back in the fall and we were going to lay a little groundwork for that. We were going to see [wife] Kathy Stabler come back very upset. Her son had been rolled by a team of ne'er-do-wells and may have been drugged, and we were going to revisit [Benson’s half-brother] Simon's seeming overdose and we were going to get to know the stresses on the Stablers — what had happened to the Stabler family after Elliot both left SVU and apparently left them."
But when Season 21 came to an early end due to the production shutdown caused by coronavirus, plans changed. "We were just going to lay some groundwork down in anticipation of Elliot's return of course in his own series. We had the sense that the first episode of next year for SVU was going to bring Elliot back, so we were going to foreshadow that and explain a little more what happened to Simon," Leight explained.
News of the spinoff first broke in March, with few details revealed at the time other than that Meloni would return to his role as Stabler again in a new series following his returns to the NYPD to head the Organized Crime Division. Martin said that with "a 10-year gap of no reference point whatsoever," there's a lot of background to fill in with where Stabler has been and how he has grown, but that it provides plenty of opportunity for crossover with his former partner in SVU as they move forward.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Christopher Meloni Will Return To ‘Law & Order: SVU’ For The Season 22 Premiere</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Joe Allen
The actor left the show after its 12th season.
Elliot Stabler is making his return. On a behind-the-scenes podcast, Law & Order: SVU showrunner Warren Leight said that Christopher Meloni will be making his return to the show in the season 22 premiere. Meloni was a member of the show’s original cast, but left the show after 12 seasons. He played Elliot Stabler, the partner of Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson.
“It’s pretty clear that Elliot will be in the SVU season opener. I think that much I know,” Leigh said of Meloni’s return to the show.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Leight said it’s not currently clear when the new show will start shooting. Meloni’s character was originally supposed to return at the end of season 21, but those plans were eventually scrapped after the coronavirus pandemic cut the season short. Stabler was also supposed to appear alongside his wife and son, but Leight is unsure whether that will still be the case moving forward.
“Whether we’ll get to see his family as well remains to be seen,” he said.
Stabler left the Special Victims Unit at the end of the show’s 12th season and retired, citing the emotional toll that the job had taken on him.
The news of Stabler’s return to the world of SVU shouldn’t come as a shock. It follows the announcement that Meloni would be getting his own spin-off set in the world of the original show, but focused on his character.
The new drama is set to revolve around Stabler leading an organized crime unit in the NYPD. The show has been given an initial 13-episode order, but little else is known about what it will involve. Entertainment Weekly reports that Chicago P.D.‘s Matt Olmstead is currently being eyed as a potential showrunner for the new series.
Since leaving SVU roughly a decade ago, Meloni has picked up parts in a variety of other projects, largely on TV. He starred in the Syfy series Happy! and also had roles in shows like Underground and Maxxx, as well as a memorable guest arc on The Handmaid’s Tale.
Speculation has already begun as to what Meloni’s new series may be called. It’s possible that the show will be another in the Law & Order series, or it could decide to take its branding in a new direction. Much like the show it has been spun-off from, there is no set premiere date for the new project, in large part because of the COVID-19 crisis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Christopher Meloni to return to ‘Law and Order: SVU’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Christopher Meloni, known for his role as Elliot Stabler, will return to Dick Wolf’s Law and Order SVU for its 22nd season, according to showrunner Warren Leight.
Leight confirmed on the SVU podcast on Wednesday that Stabler will at the least appear in the season opener.
“It’s pretty clear that Elliot will be in the SVU season opener. I think that much I know.”
The news of Christopher Meloni’s return comes a month after it was announced that his character would be getting his own show about leading his own crime unit.
No air date has been announced as of yet.
After starring alongside Mariska Hargitay, who plays Elliot’s former partner Olivia Benson, Meloni left the SVU squad following season 12.
Stabler went into retirement, citing the emotional toll of the job.
Leight also said that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear when filming of the 22nd season will begin.
It is still unclear if the entire Stabler family will be in the new season’s opening episode.
“Whether we’ll get to see his family as well remains to be seen,” says Leight.
Stabler and his family were slated to appear at the end of the show’s 21st season, however, this idea was eventually cut when the pandemic curtailed shooting.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mithila Palkar shared screen space with Irrfan Khan in the 2018 film 'Karwaan' along with the Malayalam sensation Dulquer Salmaan. The actress who is herself a talented young budding artist, immediately bonded with the great actor Irrfan as well as Dulquer and the chemistry of the trio was palpable in the film. When Irrfan Khan passed away on April 29, Mithila was one of his many co-stars who was very disturbed by the news. Sharing a still from their 2018 film together, Mithila paid her heartfelt tribute to the star. And now, the actress has taken to her Instagram account again to share her own unplugged version of the 'Heartquake' song from 'Karwaan'. It's a tribute from her Tanya to Irrfan's Shaukat.
In the post, Mithila is seen strumming a mini guitar and crooning the 'Heartquake' song in her sweet voice. With a smile on her face, the adorable star's notes are on point. However, the sadness in her voice is still very evident despite the music. She wrote a beautiful caption along with the post which read, "Hey Shaukat, This #SingSongSaturday is dedicated to you. I'm struggling with the singing and strumming as usual but I tried to learn this just so I could bother you with my Binaca Geetmala, one last time. Khush rehna, jahaan bhi ho. Khuda haafiz ❤️ Love, Tanya. #KarwaanForever."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amitabh Bachchan remembers Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan in emotional posts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Moved by the demise of Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan, Amitabh Bachchan paid them a musical tribute. For Kapoor, he posted a song sung by him for the movie 102 Not Out and, for Irrfan, he reshared the theme music of Piku.
Sharing the lyrical version of a classic Bollywood melody “Waqt Ne Kiya”, which he recreated for his last movie with Rishi Kapoor, 102 Not Out, Big B wrote, “Waqt ne kiya kya haseen sitam .. Tum rahe na tum, Hum rahe na hum ..” The video of the song features moments from the Umesh Shukla directorial where the two played father-son duo.
Ronit Roy found Bachchan’s version of the song “heartwrenching.” Replying to his tweet, Roy wrote, “This is so beautiful and heart wrenching. I can imagine what you might have felt while you were making it. @SrBachchan. Love you.”
Filmmaker Kunal Kohli also replied on senior Bachchan’s tweet. “One can only imagine your pain sir. I still can’t over losing #chintuji. Too big & too personal a loss for me & so many of us. That’s how much he touched so many different people in so many ways,” he wrote.
Rishi Kapoor passed away on April 30 after a two-year-long battle with cancer. A day before, on April 29, Irrfan Khan breathed his last in Mumbai’s Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, after battling with neuroendocrine cancer for two years.
Paying an ode to Irrfan, Amitabh Bachchan shared the theme of Piku. “… nothing could be a better ode to Irfaan than this music piece , the theme of PIKU .. there is but a softer slower paced version .. and that just fills the heart up .. !” tweeted Bachchan.
In his other social media post, the veteran actor shared a collage of photos of him with Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan. He captioned it, “The death of an elder celebrity vs death of a younger .. the grief of the latter more intense than that of the former .. why ..? The younger more tragic. Why the loss of the young seems more tragic than that of the older .. Because you lament the loss of opportunity in the latter .. unrealised possibilities.”
The death of two iconic actors has left the entire film fraternity saddened.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rishi Kapoor’s wife Neetu Kapoor has bid the farewell to her husband in the most heartbreaking and emotional manner and it will definitely bring tears to your eyes. Two days after the death of the actor, she took to Instagram to share a throwback picture of the Bobby actor where he can be seen holding a drink in his hand and smiles brightly in the picture. Sharing the photo, she wrote, “End of our story.” Also Read - Amitabh Bachchan Reflects on Irrfan Khan And Rishi Kapoor's Death, Answers Why Losing Younger Celeb Feels More Tragic Than Losing an Elder
Earlier, Neetu shared a long post and stated he would like to be remembered with smile and not with tears. The post reads, “Our dear Rishi Kapoor passed away peacefully at 8:45am IST in hospital today after a two-year battle with leukemia. The doctors and medical staff at the hospital said he kept them entertained to the last. He remained jovial and determined to live to the fullest right through two years of treatment across two continents. Family, friends, food and films remained his focus and everyone who met him during this time was amazed at how he did not let his illness get the better of him.”
“He was grateful for the love of his fans that poured in from the world over. In his passing, they would all understand that he would like to be remembered with a smile and not with tears.In this hour of personal loss, we also recognise the world is going through a very difficult and troubled time. There are numerous restrictions around movement and gathering in public. We would like to request all his fans and well-wishers and friends of the family to please respect the laws that are in force. He would not have it any other way”, it further stated.
The Mulk actor died at the age of 67 on April 30 after a long battle with bone marrow cancer. He was cremated in Chandanwadi crematorium with family members and few industry celebrities in attendance. The funeral was attended by Ranbir Kapoor, wife Neetu Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Randhir Kapoor, Babita Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Ayan Mukerji, Anil Ambani among others.
In 2018, Rishi was diagnosed with cancer and got treated in the US for a year and had returned to India in September 2019. The actor is survived by his wife Neetu Kapoor and children Ranbir and Riddhima Kapoor.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Post Rishi Kapoor’s Demise, Here’s What Makers Are Upto With Actor’s Last Film ‘Sharmaji Namkeen’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On January 9, 2018, producer Honey Trehan along with debutant director Hitesh Bhatia reached at the residence of Rishi Kapoor for a script-narration of their upcoming film, “Sharmaji Namkeen”. The legendry actor is excited on hearing the script, he decides to sign the film.
“I am that youngster who watched, admired and loved Rishiji on-screen. There are several films that I call my favourite, and ‘Chandni’ always topped the list. So it was nostalgia and excitement rolled into one when I went to narrate the film and cast him in the project,” recalled Honey, one of the producers of the film along with Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani.
Trehan recalls that Rishi Kapoor fell sick within a few days after the start of shooting, and he flew to the US for his treatment.
“We stopped the film and waited for him to come back. He is the DNA of the film and we cannot imagine anyone else to play Sharmaji. They stayed in touch with him and he was so eager to come back and get on to the film set. So naturally, when things started rolling, his energy and high professionalism were driving us,” said the producer.
After Rishi Kapoor returned to India, shooting was scheduled to resume on January 15, 2020, in Delhi. Unfortunately Kapoor lost his sister Ritu Nanda, and on January 14 had to travel to Delhi to attend to his family amid emotional crisis.
Keeping the situation in mind, the producers decided to reschedule the shooting.
“However Rishiji said, ‘bakwas maat karo, what happened is personal but work is my profession. I am equally responsible for both. The show must go on. This is what my father taught me’. You see, under such circumstances where he lost his sister, he did not forget the high professional value that he learnt from Raj Kapoor saab. Rishi sir knew that the responsibility of the film is on his shoulder as he played the title role of the film. He knew that the unit will suffer if we stop the shooting and there comes his spirit and energy to encourage us saying, ‘the show must go on, mujhe call time bataao’,” Trehan recalled.
Remembering the affectionate nature of the legendry actor, he added: “On January 15 in the Delhi winter, our call time was 9 am. When I reached the set around 8:45 am, I find him ready — not even sitting in his vanity but standing there, on the set! He smiled at me saying, ‘Tu T-shirt pehna hai, thand nehi lagti? Jacket kyun nahin pehna?’ That’s Rishi Kapoor for you. Loving, affectionate towards everyone around him.”
Does he feel the pressure of the fact that this will be counted as Rishi Kapoor’s last film? “A film with Rishi Kapoor is always special. But this one is ‘sadly’ special, and this is not why a film should be special. Hitesh and I are really not in the frame of mind to think about how we will finish the film. We need time. We are sad, deeply sad” Honey signed off.
Regarding the future of the film, sources close to us now reveal, ““The microscopic details of how Ritesh and Farhan intend to bring the film to completion are in the works but rest assured that the film will get completed and see a theatrical release.”
Sharmaji Namkeen will see Rishi Kapoor in the lead along with Juhi Chawla. The film is produced by Excel Entertainment in association with Honey Teheran and Abhishek Choubey. The film will also mark Hitesh Bhatia’s debut as the director.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After Irrfan Khan's untimely demise on April 29, his family has been penning heartfelt tribute to him and sharing their happy memories with him. Yesterday, the actor's wife, Sutapa Sikdar penned a moving eulogy, which spoke volumes about their love for each other. And now, Irrfan's younger son Ayaan shared some of his unseen pictures with dad.
Posting two pictures of himself with the late actor, Ayaan captioned them as, 'The flesh we roam this earth in is a blessing, not a promise....'
The first picture features Ayaan riding a bike with Irrfan and it's such a cute father-son moment!
In the second picture, Ayaan and Irrfan are seen walking on a street, perhaps in London, where the actor underwent cancer treatment for several months.
Meanwhile, Irrfan's elder son Babil, too, walked down the memory lane and shared a throwback video of his late father on his Instagram page. In the video, the Angrezi Medium actor is seen relishing pani-puri at a restaurant. Babil captioned the video as, 'When you're on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani-puri.'
In his last interview with Filmfare, Irrfan opened up about his struggle as an actor and said, "I have waited for work, and I have waited long. I used to think I'll meet X director and show him Y pictures and boom! Whenever I have tried that, it has actually worked adversely. You can't start performing when you meet someone right? And besides, I am shy, so it works against my temperament. I am lucky to never be out of work, but I have always waited. When I was in TV, I waited for films, when was in films, I waited for the right role, when I had the right role, I waited for the right film... it's a never ending process."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1, 2020
Brandon Bombay
Fox Sports host Holly Sonders continued to scintillate her Instagram followers with steamy posts. She showed off her body in a new bikini picture that gave fans a view of her assets and chiseled figure.
The model has used downtime in recent weeks to focus more on social media and engaging with her fans. Sonders – whose real name is Holly Niederkohr – built a name for herself as a competitive golfer and has always focused on fitness. The TV personality has never been shy about posting revealing photos on Instagram, but has upped the ante over the past month with a flurry of lingerie and swimsuit posts.
In her latest post, Sonders offered fans a glimpse of her body in a swimsuit snap that appeared to be taken at home. The 33-year-old stood in front of a large window with the shades drawn, and her entire body was in frame. She wore her long brunette hair down and held her left hand to the side of her head, which was turned to the right as she stared away from the lens. There was a dark hair scrunchy on her right wrist.
Sonders wore a dark metallic bikini with high-waist bottoms, and clear high heels. Her sculpted abs were outlined by the swimsuit bottoms. The white backdrop helped the fitness model’s bronzed legs and defined midsection pop in the photo. She included a caption that referenced putting in work at home to get fit.
Many of the former golfer’s 462,000 followers showed their approval for the spicy shot. Sonders earned more than 6,600 likes in just over five hours after posting. She received over 160 comments as her replies were swarmed with heart and tongue emoji. Multiple fans joked about the fitness model being out of shape. Fellow Fox Sports analyst, Brian Baldinger teased Sonders.
“Are you ever going to get back in shape Holly; or are you content just to slug it out?” he wrote.
“Is that a baby bump?” one follower playfully asked.
The fitness model was the recipient of plenty of compliments as well.
“I must tell you (as a fitness trainer) that you have an insanely gorgeous body,” a fan responded.
“Walkin on stilts,” another wrote, referring to her long legs.
As covered by The Inquisitr, last week Sonders uploaded a series of spicy bikini pics from previous photo shoots. In one image she wore a blue top while she laid on a putting green, and used six golf balls to cover up below the waistline.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rihanna’s Latest Lingerie Shoot Sets New Record!
Global fashion icon, businesswoman, singer and celebrity, Rihanna caused a stir on Instagram when she launched her new lingerie line with a raunchy photoshoot.
The post reached 1 million likes in just 17 minutes and now has over 7 million likes!
In her post, the star seems to make reference to Megan Thee Stallion’s hit song ” Savage”  while flaunting her figure in a sexy black ensemble.
Megan, who is a Savage x Fenty ambassador, features Beyonce on the remix to her hit song.
Riri, who first solidified her spot in the history books as a songstress, has over the years diversified and made her mark in fashion and business.
The entrepreneur is the founder of the nonprofit organization, Clara Lionel Foundation, cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty, fashion house Fenty under LVMH and lingerie line, Savage X Fenty.
Her new range of lingerie is another partnership with independent New York designer, Adam Selman.
It seems we can expect a lot from Rihanna this year.
Rumour has it that an Amazon documentary of her life is set to be released, on her hit song Pon De Replay’s 15th anniversary!
Who knows, maybe we will get that new album we have been waiting so long for!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Evans joins Instagram for a cause</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Los Angeles: "Captain America" star Chris Evans has finally joined Instagram to raise funds for the fight against the novel coronavirus.
Evans made his debut on the photo-sharing website on May 1 and shared that he is taking part in the All In Challenge, launched to help raise money to fight hunger during the COVID-19 pandemic, reports aceshowbiz.com.
In his debut video Evan says: "A virtual hangout with me and five of my closest friends.
He was referring to his "Avengers" co-stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner.
"We can do a private Q&A. You can ask us anything. We'll spill the beans. And then maybe some games."
Evans feels the cause should encourage fans to join in. "This is a great cause. This helps people who are in need during this COVID nightmare. So I am very happy to be doing this."
He then passed the challenge to fellow Marvel star friends, Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie, as well as "Pose" star Billy Porter.
The actor's challenge page shared details that the offer of hanging out goes to one lucky winner and two friends.
"100 per cent of the money raised through this Game/Auction will go directly to Feeding America, Meals On Wheels, World Central Kitchen and No Kid Hungry," read his statement.

The appearance comes just a day after Evans joined Instagram and participated in the All in Challenge. In a video message, he revealed that he would be offering a virtual hang out with his Avengers: Endgame costars. "We can do a private Q&A, you can ask us anything, we'll spill the beans, then maybe some games," he said. "I would recommend Scattergories."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Current RAW Women's Champion Becky Lynch hasn't been seen much on WWE television since her WrestleMania 36 match against Shayna Baszler. Lynch, though, has been actively promoting her appearance on the TV series Billions, as she appears in a cameo in season 5 of the series.
While speaking to TV Insider to promote the series, Becky Lynch was asked who from the WWE would fit into the show. The current champion revealed that WWE Chairman, Vince McMahon, would be a good fit for the show, and revealed how his "eccentric character" would do well on the series.
She said that Vince McMahon fell off a tower to show a Superstar how to do it recently:
Vince McMahon is known for his odd behaviour and how he will go to any length to get his point across.
Becky Lynch hasn't wrestled since she defended her title at WrestleMania 36, where she defeated Baszler to retain her title. The Man has held the belt for nearly 400 days and it seems that the title reign will continue, considering she's not in any feud at the moment.
The Man hasn't been booked for the Money in the Bank PPV, which will take place on May 10, 2020, and we could perhaps see him after that show. Becky Lynch, in the same TV Insider interview, spoke about how she would like to have cinematic matches in the future, and that she has been pitching various things to WWE's creative team.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rakesh Roshan: “When I Met Rishi Kapoor In March Before The Lockdown, Chintu, Neetu Kapoor…”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last Thursday, veteran actor Rishi Kapoor passed away and left the Bollywood industry with a void. The actor was cremated at Marine Lines in presence of close family and friends including Neetu Kapoor, Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Abhishek Bachchan, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Saif Ali Khan amongst others. Due to the lockdown, a lot of fraternity members couldn’t be a part of the last rites. Now, filmmaker Rakesh Roshan is opening up all about his best friend’s demise.
The Krrish director in a recent interview opened up about their inseparable bond along with actor Jeetendra being a part of the clan. Opening up about how they met just before the lockdown, Rakesh Roshan further revealed about the moment he heard of Rishi Kapoor’s demise and broke down.
In a conversation with mid-day, Rakesh Roshan shared, “(In 2018), our cancer diagnosis came months apart — his in August, and mine in December. But we both fought with a smile on our face. He was always brave and full of life. When I met him in March before the lockdown, Chintu, Neetu and I reminisced about our good old days.”
He further opened up about the time he called Ranbir Kapoor to inquire if everything is alright soon after the news of Rishi Kapoor passing away broke out. “I spoke to Neetu earlier this week when I learnt he was hospitalised and prayed for his speedy recovery. I woke up this morning to a message from a friend, asking if Rishi Kapoor was all right. When I called Dabboo [Randhir Kapoor], his number was busy. That’s when my heart sank and I instinctively knew something was wrong. Then I rang up Ranbir who shared the news. It was so shocking that I started crying on the phone. Instead of me consoling him, Ranbir comforted me. He has been a pillar of strength to his father,” added Rakesh Roshan.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amitabh Bachchan Reveals Why He Never Visited Rishi Kapoor In Hospital & It Will Make You Emotional!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was Amitabh Bachchan who broke the news of Rishi Kapoor's death on social media. He mourned his close friend's demise and tweeted, "He's Gone.. ! Rishi Kapoor .. gone ... just passed away .. I am destroyed." Rishi, who was diagnosed with leukemia in 2018, passed away at a Mumbai hospital on Thursday (April 30).

Later, Big B took to his blog to pen a heartfelt memoir for his Amar Akbar Anthony co-star. The superstar poured his heart out and shared fond memories of his close friend.
Recalling his first impression of Rishi, the Brahmastra actor said, "(I) had seen him at his home Deonar Cottage, Chembur, a young energetic, bubbly, mischief in his eyes Chintu, on those rare moments when I was privileged to have been invited to an evening at Raj ji's house .. I would see him more often after, at RK Studios, when he trained as an actor for his film to be made, BOBBY .. a diligent enthusiastic youngster, ready to pounce onto every learning that came his way, in that famous large and legendary makeup room, of Raj ji at the end of the first-floor corridor of makeup rooms .."
He compared his friend to Prithiviraj Kapoor and continued in his blog, "He had a walk that was confident and determined .. a stride and style that was similar to that of his grandfather, the legendary Prithvi Raj ji .. a walk I had noticed in one of his earlier films .. that walk .. I never found it in any other .."
Big B spoke about his working experience with Rishi and revealed, "We worked in several films together ..When he spoke his lines, you believed every word of it .. there was never an alternative .. its genuineness was beyond question .. And there has never been any other, that could lip sync a song as perfectly as he would..never .."
Describing Rishi's nature, he added, "His playful attitude on set was infectious .. even in the most grave sequences he would discover that comedic spark and we would all just crack up .. !! Not just on set .. if you were with him at any formal event , he would find that little distractive light hearted gem to expand on and lighten the situation ..When there was a time lapse as the shot got readied during a shoot , he would bring out his playing cards , or at times pull out his rather complicated Bagatelle board and invite others to play .. a competition .. not just for fun .. a serious competition.."
Big B remembered the Bobby actor as a fighter and continued, "During his time of diagnosis and his treatment he never ever lamented his condition .. it was always .. 'see you soon, just a routine visit to the Hospital .. I'll be back shortly '. Joie de vivre .. the exuberant enjoyment of life , was a gene he inherited from his father .. the Legend, the Ultimate Showman the Iconic Raj Kapoor..I never visited him in Hospital .. I never wanted to see distress on his smiling cherubic face ..But I am certain .. when he went, he must have gone with a gentle smile ..."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan Khan’s son Ayaan took to Instagram to share some rare photos of his father recently. The first black and white memory captured the father-son duo enjoying a bike ride while Ayaan was a child. And a second throwback photo saw Irrfan and Ayaan walking down a street, which seems to be a more recent one. Remembering his father, Ayaan had captioned the post, “The flesh we roam this earth in is a blessing, not a promise.”

Irrfan Khan’s older son Babil had also posted an unseen video of his father relishing pani-puri. Babil had captioned the clip, “When you’re on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani puri.” Babil’s post was flooded with emotional comments by grieving fans, expressing strength to the late actor’s family.
Irrfan Khan passed away on Wednesday after a two year long battle against neuroendocrine cancer. In a gratitude note, the actor’s wife Sutapa had expressed that it was not a loss but a gain of the things that he taught them. She shared, “How can I write this as a family statement when the whole world is taking it as a personal loss? How can I begin to feel alone when millions are grieving with us at the moment? I want to assure everyone that this is not a loss, it is a gain. It’s a gain of the things he taught us, and now we shall finally begin to truly implement it and evolve. Yet I want to try to fill in the things that people don’t already know. Funnily, our life was a masterclass in acting, so when the dramatic entry of the ‘uninvited guests’ happened, I had by then learnt, to see a harmony in the cacophony. The doctor’s reports were like scripts which I wanted to perfect, so I never miss any detail that he sought for in his performance.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WILTON, Conn. — Actor Joe Pantoliano, known for his roles in movies and in HBO’s “Sopranos,” is recovering at his Connecticut home after being struck by a car while walking.
Pantoliano’s agent told Variety the 68-year-old actor was walking near his rural home in Wilton when two nearby cars crashed into each other. The collision sent one of the cars sliding down the asphalt, where it collided with Pantoliano and knocked him to the ground.
The impact left him with a gash on his head and other injuries. His agent told Variety that Pantoliano was taken to a nearby hospital.
A post on Instagram showed Pantoliano with stitches in his head and giving a thumbs-up sign. It read, “Joey is home recovering. He has a severe head injury and some chest trauma.”
Pantoliano played mobster Ralph Cifaretto on the HBO series and has appeared in “The Matrix,” and other films including “Bad Boys,” “Risky Business,” “The Fugitive” and “Midnight Run.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Pantoliano is at home recovering after being hit by a car.
A rep for the Sopranos star confirmed to ET that Pantoliano, 68, was struck by a vehicle during a walk with his family on Friday.
Per the rep, Pantoliano was knocked over by a Porsche that had been T-boned by another vehicle and skidded across a road in Connecticut. The Porsche pushed the Bad Boys for Life actor into a wooden fence, leaving him with a gash on his head and injuries to one of his legs and shoulders. He was taken to a local hospital and has since returned home.
"He received stitches and is being monitored for a concussion and head trauma and is now home," the actor’s agent, Barry McPherson, said. "He is grateful for the concern and thoughts from his fans."
Once at home, photos of the actor and his head injury were shared on his Instagram, along with a message thanking everyone for their well wishes.
"Joey is home recovering. He has a severe head injury and some chest trauma. He is going to be dark for a couple days while recovering," the post reads. "Thank you for all the well wishes and positive vibes. Keep them coming! We'll reading them to him to help him get better!"
The post quickly filled with even more positive and supportive messages. The Sopranos star Kathrine Narducci, as well as Michael Gandolfini, Maureen McCormick, Jennifer Tilly and Michael Chiklis, among others, left their friend notes.
"Oh good, was worried! Feel better," Gandolfini wrote.
"Lucky you're so tough and stubborn! Try and stick around for another 40 years will!" Tilly commented. "American cinema needs you! You are a national treasure."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Sopranos actor Joe Pantoliano was rushed to hospital on Friday after being involved in a horrifying car accident while out for a walk.
The 68-year-old American actor was thrown through the air and into a fence while his distressed family quickly called an ambulance when the incident took place in Connecticut.
Joe was struck by a Porsche which skidded out of control across the street before smashing into another car, according to TMZ.
The actor’s wife, former model Nancy Sheppard, gave an eyewitness account but also explained she thinks her husband will make a full recovery following the accident.
TMZ reports that Nancy explained: “Joe was sent flying a couple feet backward into an old wooden fence."
They add: "He suffered a gash on his head, plus injuries to his left leg and a shoulder.”
The actor was then rushed to hospital where he was given a CT scan.
Joe later took Instagram to share photographs of himself smiling and giving a thumbs up – while also sporting a nasty looking cut on his head – after returning home from hospital.
The actor looked upbeat, despite the injury, as he posed in a red t-shirt and blue coat.
Sharing the snaps online, a statement reads: “Joey is home recovering. He has a severe head injury and some chest trauma.”
The statement continues: “He is going to be dark for a couple days while recovering.”
And adds: “Thank you for all the well wishes and positive vibes. Keep them coming! We'll reading them to him to help him get better.”
Fans flooded the comments section with words of encouragement, with one fan telling The Matrix star: “Praying for a speedy and full recovery.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nick Cordero’s Wife Reveals Her Husband Was Taken Off Ventilator Following COVID-19 Struggle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nick Cordero was recently taken off of a ventilator, his wife, Amanda Kloots revealed. According to Page Six, who was the first to pick up on her Instagram Stories, Nick was taken off the ventilator and he’s on the “trach,” as Amanda put it.
According to Kloots, her 41-year-old husband had to undergo a tracheostomy for the sake of moving away from the ventilator. Page Six reported that the process involves the creation of a hole in an individual’s throat to make room for an oxygen tube.
Kloots said on her IG stories that doctors were waiting for Nick’s condition to get better before they did the procedure, and over the last few weeks, they decided he was finally strong enough to go through with it.
The fitness trainer said before her followers that Nick’s doctors had been trying to do it for a long time now, but they kept having to push it back on account of his condition. As it was previously reported, Nick has been in intensive care since the beginning of April.
There’s no question the Broadway star has struggled to beat COVID-19, which led to serious complications, including the necessitation of an amputation. On the 24th of April, doctors discovered that the virus was finally out of his system, but they had more work to do.
Earlier this week, on Friday, Amanda said on her IG that Nick was finally going to go through with the operation and she was thrilled about it. The 39-year-old fitness trainer has been documenting Nick’s recovery ever since the symptoms began worsening. They have a 10-month-old son named Elvis.
On the 30th of April, Bridget Hill reported on Amanda’s IG Story in which she said Nick was suffering from a low red-blood-cell count. This wasn’t that long after his amputation. Doctors decided it was best to remove his leg due to complications from blood-thinning medication that was needed to prevent clotting, which may have traveled into his heart and killed him.
Fortunately, this all seems to be behind him, and Nick may be on the road to a full recovery in the ensuing weeks.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Broadway star Nick Cordero has been taken off a ventilator after undergoing a successful procedure to insert a breathing tube, his wife said.
Tony Award-nominated Cordero was placed in intensive care shortly after being admitted to a Los Angeles hospital in March suffering with coronavirus.
Last month the 41-year-old had his leg amputated due to complications from the illness and he had been on a ventilator after his lungs were left “severely damaged”.
His wife, Amanda Kloots, has been sharing updates with fans on social media and on Friday revealed a tracheostomy tube had been successfully inserted into his neck, allowing him to come off the ventilator.
Kloots said on Instagram: “We have been trying to do this for Nick for so many weeks now and it just kept getting stalled and pushed back because of his health and now he was finally healthy enough today to get the trach and the ventilator is out.
“This is just amazing news because we really needed this to happen to get him off that ventilator. I think he will be feeling better, even subconsciously feeling better.
“I hope this is just a great sign for some good recovery days ahead and for him to wake up and just have that pressure relief from his throat. Thank God.”
Cordero, a father of one, was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles after testing positive for Covid-19.
His wife has been leading the #WakeUpNick campaign, which has been backed by several celebrities, including his close friend the actor Zach Braff.
Cordero played a mob soldier in 2014 Broadway show Bullets Over Broadway, for which he received a Tony nomination for best featured actor in a musical.
His TV roles include Blue Bloods and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande team up to benefit frontline workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Pop superstars Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande are teaming up for the first time on a duet that will fund scholarships for the children of health and emergency workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic.
The duet, called “Stuck With U,” will be released on May 8, the two singers announced on Friday on Instagram, where they jointly have some 316 million followers.
All net proceeds from streaming and sales of the duet will be donated to the First Responders Children’s Foundation to fund grants and scholarships for the children of those working during the pandemic.
Bieber, 26, and Grande, 26, two of the biggest young singers in the United States with hits like “Love Yourself” and “Thank U, Next,” have never recorded a song together.
“We hope we make a big difference with this and we hope it uplifts you and makes you feel happy,” Grande said in a statement.
The single is the first in series from Scooter Braun, who manages both singers, that will benefit charities during the year, Braun said.

Celine Dion, Justin Bieber and Margaret Atwood were among the Canadian celebrities who joined for a broadcast event Sunday to honor healthcare workers battling the coronavirus pandemic and raise money for food banks. The "Stronger Together/Tous Ensemble" event, which was broadcast on radio, television and streamed online, brought together Canadian personalities who sang or delivered messages of solidarity from their living rooms or -- in the case of Dion -- their kitchens. / AFP / LISA O'CONNOR Image Credit: AFPView gallery as list

The singer had originally been set to embark on her High Road Tour in April, but postponed it amid the outbreak.
On Friday, she announced it had been cancelled, saying it is “no longer feasible” to aim for a 2020 tour and would aim to tour next year.
Writing on Instagram, she said: “This is heartbreaking, but the safety of my fans & crew is my number 1 priority.
“Because of the current situation, doing this tour in 2020 is no longer feasible. But that doesn’t mean we can’t celebrate and express ourselves together in spirit and online. I will do my best to bring you all as much art and music as I can, as we get through this all together.”
All purchased tickets will be refunded, Kesha said.
The star, whose hits include Tik Tok and Die Young, added: “I truly can’t wait to get back on the road again and play songs from High Road for you. Thank you for being here, and for your understanding. Please stay tuned for more info about new tour dates in 2021.
“I’m going to boogie with you SO hard next year. Stay well and stay strong, wishing all of you health!  XOXO. at the end of a storm comes a rainbow.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vanessa Bryant posted a birthday message for her late daughter, Gianna, on what would be her 14th birthday on Friday.
Gianna “Gigi” Bryant, who was born on May 1, 2006, died in a helicopter crash with her father Kobe Bryant in Calabasas, California, in late January.
Seven passengers who were also aboard the helicopter were killed in the crash – Alyssa Altobelli, John Altobelli, Keri Altobelli, Christina Mauser, Payton Chester, Sarah Chester, and Ara Zobayan.
“Mommy loves you more than I can ever show you,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the post. “You are part of MY SOUL forever. I miss you so much everyday. I wish I could wake up and have you here with me.”
“I miss your smile, your hugs, and your giggles,” she continued. “I miss EVERYTHING about YOU, Gigi.”
Vanessa wrote in a follow-up post that her daughter “loved to wear a red bow in all of her school pictures,” and wanted people to “commemorate Gigi’s birthday today, please consider wearing red, caption an act of kindness or show how you will play Gigi’s way since she always gave everything she did her all and led with kindness.”
She posted a picture of a red bracelet with the words Gigi’s name and her nickname, “Mambacita,” writing that it will soon be on sale, the proceeds of which would benefit the Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation, which was started in their memory.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">No, he wasn't hit by shrapnel.
Actor Joe Pantoliano was struck by a vehicle while out for a stroll on Friday and was taken to a Connecticut hospital, according to a report.
Later Friday evening, Pantoliano’s wife, Nancy, told TMZ that the “Sopranos” cast member was recovering at home after suffering "a severe head injury and some chest trauma."
Photos posted to the site showed the 68-year-old native of Hoboken, N.J., with a nasty, stitched-up cut on the left side of his head but he was smiling and giving the "thumbs up" sign.
Nancy said the popular "Joey Pants" was walking with the family in their neighborhood when a Porsche was allegedly T-boned by another car and sent across the road where Pantoliano was walking, hitting him.
Nancy reportedly told the outlet that Pantoliano, who is also well-recognized as the loud and anxious Captain Howard in the popular “Bad Boys” film franchise -- as well as the creepy mobster Ralph Cifaretto on "The Sopranos," known for hitting Tony Soprano's sister Janice with "shrapnel" when clipping his toenails -- was sent airborne a couple of feet backward where he crashed into an old wooden fence and got a gash to his head, along with injuries to his left leg and shoulder.

Paramedics are said to have arrived quickly and rushed the “Matrix” actor to a nearby hospital where he is currently being treated and awaiting the results of a CT scan, TMZ reports.

According to the outlet, per Nancy, the drivers of both vehicles involved in the accident stayed at the scene while police were investigating.
Pantoliano shared a video to his Instagram account Friday morning of lush greenery with a rainbow backdrop, which family members reportedly said was taken before he left for his walk.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WILTON, Conn. (AP) - Actor Joe Pantoliano, known for his roles in movies and in HBO’s “Sopranos,” is recovering at his Connecticut home after being struck by a car while walking.
Pantoliano’s agent told Variety the 68-year-old actor was walking near his rural home in Wilton when two nearby cars crashed into each other. The collision sent one of the cars sliding down the asphalt, where it collided with Pantoliano and knocked him to the ground.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sam Lloyd, who appeared on 'Scrubs' and 'Seinfeld,' dies at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Sam Lloyd, who appeared on several television shows and portrayed lawyer Ted Buckland on the comedy, "Scrubs," has died. He was 56.
Lloyd's agent confirmed his death Friday night but did not provide details on the cause. Variety reported that he was diagnosed with a brain tumor and cancer last year, and it spread to his lungs and spine. He found out he had cancer weeks after his wife, Vanessa, gave birth to their firstborn, the report said
Over a span of two decades, Lloyd's television career included roles in major television shows such as "Desperate Housewives," "Seinfeld," "Modern Family," "The West Wing," "Cougar Town" and "Malcolm in the Middle," according to his agent. He also appeared in the films "Flubber" and "Galaxy Quest."
Some of the people he'd worked with paid tribute to him Friday night.
"Rest In peace to one of the funniest actors I've ever had the joy of working with," actor Zach Braff tweeted. "Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
"Scrubs" creator Bill Lawrence described him as a "kind, sweet guy" who will be missed by many.
Lloyd was also a musician. He sang in an a cappella group The Blanks, and played bass guitar in a band called The Butties.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Sam Lloyd, best known for playing lawyer Ted Buckland on the comedy-drama "Scrubs" has died at the age of 56, TMZ reported on Friday. 
"Scrubs" creator Bill Lawrence took to Twitter the same day to express his condolences on hearing the sad news.
In the popular TV series "Scrubs", Lloyd portrayed a depressed lawyer who had suicidal thoughts due to self-esteem issues and was plainly inept at his profession.
Apart from "Scrubs", Lloyd also appeared on "Desperate Housewives," "Happy Together," "Shameless," and "Modern Family".
Doctors said earlier that his brain tumour was inoperable.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Scrubs' actor Sam Lloyd dead at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd -- best known for portraying lawyer Ted Buckland on the sitcom "Scrubs" -- has died, his agent confirmed to Fox News on Friday. He was 56.
Lloyd died on Thursday as a result of complications from lung cancer, according to a statement obtained by Fox News from the late actor's wife, Vanessa.
"Our family is devastated. It doesn't feel real. It never will. It just feels like he will walk through the door," the statement continued. "The overwhelming outpouring of love and sharing your stories about working with or knowing Sam keeps his memory alive and our hearts strong.

"Sam loved his work. I want to continue his legacy, and hope to share some of the beautiful songs he was working on for his musical and our son, Weston," the statement concluded.
In January 2019, Lloyd was diagnosed with a brain tumor shortly after Vanessa gave birth to their first child together -- a son named Weston, according to a GoFundMe page for the late actor. Doctors also found that the cancer had metastasized from his lungs and spread to his spine, jaw and liver, per the page, which was created by "Scrubs" executive producer Tim Hobert.
In addition to starring as Ted on the long-running series "Scrubs," Lloyd appeared in a handful of shows over the span of his career, including "Cougar Town,” “Desperate Housewives,” “Seinfeld,” “Modern Family,” “The West Wing” and “Shameless,” as well as movies such as “Flubber” and “Galaxy Quest.”

Following news of his passing, tributes poured in from the "Scrubs" family.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hollywood's Henry Willson Led a Much More Tragic Life Than His Netflix Character</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In Ryan Murphy's Hollywood, Jim Parsons brings the character of prominent agent Henry Willson to life, but how much of Hollywood's depiction is actually true? A good amount of it, actually, if we take a look back at the real Willson's life as an agent to the stars — namely Rock Hudson.
The fictionalized Willson is a brash, closeted gay man who seemingly preys on inexperienced actors. He discovers Hudson — when he's still Roy Fitzgerald — and changes his name, his teeth, and his appearance to groom him to be a mainstay in Hollywood. He also sleeps with him, knowing Hudson is also in the closet. In the show, though, Willson loses control of Hudson when the actor decides to go public with his screenwriter boyfriend. After treating his client like trash and pushing him away, he comes groveling back a year later saying he's a changed man who has settled down with a partner, stopped drinking, and is making amends — and shopping around a movie about a gay couple.
Up until Hudson's coming-out storyline, Willson's portrayal is accurate to how the real Willson led his life in Hollywood. Willson started his Hollywood career as a writer before becoming an agent. And he did, in fact, "create" Rock Hudson, including changing his name, beefing him up, and getting his teeth fixed. He did this with many other actors at the time, including Guy Madison, Tab Hunter, and Yale Summers. But his career was a little bit unsavory, so to speak, according to Mark Griffin, who wrote All That Heaven Allows: A Biography of Rock Hudson. Griffin told NPR in 2018, "I think it was fairly well-known that if you were a Henry Willson client, as Tony Curtis once expressed it, you probably had to sexually express yourself to Henry." But it was accepted among the Hollywood elite that Willson was the man to make gay actors appear straight.
Willson went so far to help Hudson — who remained publicly closeted for his entire life — appear straight that he orchestrated a marriage between his top client and his secretary Phyllis Gates in 1955. Gates filed for divorce after just three years, and Willson was never able to force Hudson into another marriage.
Willson and Hudson continued to work together for years, until Hudson's star climbed higher than Willson could reach. According to Vanity Fair, Willson's excessive drinking led him to be unreliable for Hudson, and the actor ended up firing him in 1966. Willson went on a downward spiral over the next 10 years, losing everything because of his drinking problem and eventually dying of cirrhosis of the liver in 1978. He died alone and broke, and was buried in an unmarked grave.
His real ending with Hudson, though, did have some similarities to Hollywood. In Murphy's show, after Willson apologizes to Hudson for everything he put him through, Hudson tells him he can't forgive him. However, Willson shares his dream of making a movie about a gay love story for Hudson to star in as a sort of penance for his wrongdoings, seemingly patching things up between the two. While none of this happened in real life, Hudson extended a sort of olive branch, toward the end of Willson's life: he sent him $20,000 to help him out after he lost everything, and reportedly said, "That's it. I don't owe Henry anything anymore."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd, best known for his role as New Sacred Heart lawyer Ted Buckland on the long-running NBC-ABC medical comedy Scrubs, died Thursday night in Los Angeles, his rep, Kevin Turner, told The Hollywood Reporter. He was 56.
The Vermont native had been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last year, which was revealed in a GoFundMe campaign launched by Scrubs producer Tom Hobert and his wife, Jill. The fundraiser had raised nearly $160,000.
In a family statement provided by his wife, Vanessa Lloyd, she wrote, "Sam passed away peacefully at 10:30 on April 30th, 2020 as a result of complications from lung cancer. Our family is devastated. It doesn't feel real. It never will. It just feels like he will walk through the door.
"The overwhelming outpouring of love and sharing your stories about working with or knowing Sam keeps his memory alive and our hearts strong," she continued. "Sam loved his work. I want to continue his legacy, and hope to share some of the beautiful songs he was working on for his musical and our son, Weston."
Scrubs star Zach Braff paid tribute to Lloyd on Twitter, writing: "Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence also paid his respects on social media, tweeting: "Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many."
Aside from appearing on 95 episodes of Scrubs as Buckland, Lloyd reprised the role for another Lawrence series, Cougar Town. His other TV credits included Lawrence's Spin City, Seinfeld, Desperate Housewives, Shameless, Modern Family and Happy Together. On the film side, he appeared in Galaxy Quest and Flubber.
Survivors include his wife and Weston, who was born in 2019.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd, best known as sad-sack lawyer Ted Buckland on Scrubs, died Friday. He was 56.
The actor had been diagnosed with lung cancer in January 2019, per Entertainment Weekly, only weeks after his wife, Vanessa, gave birth to their first child. At the time, doctors discovered an inoperable tumor in his brain. 
Lloyd, who is the nephew of Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd, had screen career spanning three decades. He jumped between TV and film, in projects as wide-ranging as Flubber, Galaxy Quest, Seinfeld, The West Wing, and Desperate Housewives. 
In addition to his work as an actor, Lloyd was an accomplished musician with the a cappella group The Blanks (which Scrubs fans might recognize as The Worthless Peons) and the Beatles cover band The Butties.
But Lloyd was probably most recognizable as Ted on Scrubs, appearing in all nine seasons and even reprising the role for a guest arc in Cougar Town. 
Some of Lloyd's former colleagues paid tribute to him on social media, including Scrubs star Zach Braff and Scrubs and Cougar Town creator Bill Lawrence.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Scrubs' star Sam Lloyd has died aged 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BELOVED US TV star Sam Lloyd has sadly passed away. 
Lloyd, who was best known for playing lawyer Ted Buckland on the hit medical comedy series Scrubs, died on Thursday evening in Los Angeles, aged 56. 
His representative, Kevin Turner, confirmed the tragic news to The Hollywood Reporter. 
Lloyd, who was originally from Vermont, was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour last year. 
News of his illness was revealed after Scrubs producer Tom Hobert and his wife Jill launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for his treatment. 
The campaign raised close to $160,000. 
However, an update on the GoFundMe campaign page revealed back in February that Sam had been rushed to hospital after suffering swelling on his brain. 
Though doctors were able to remove a tumour, there were further complications resulting in two further emergency brain surgeries. 
Sam was later transferred to ICU at Cedars Sinai hospital in LA, where he was put on a “breathing tube and feeding tube”.  
News of his sad passing prompted an outpouring of tributes from his Scrubs co-star. 
They were led by Zach Braff, who wrote on Twitter: 
Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy." 
Fellow co-star and character actor Robert Maschio also posted a warm tribute to his late colleague, posting a picture of them together alongside the message: “Simpler times, happier days, the kindest man I ever met.  ‘Easy going Sam, Rest In Peace. #RIPSamLloyd.” 
Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence, meanwhile wrote: "Spent the night watching clips of Sam (The songs! The greatest sweaty pratfall of all time!) Those who reached out, our “Scrubs family” appreciates it - he had the biggest heart of all of us. But now send all those good thoughts to his family. And to your own loved ones." 
A regular and much loved character on Scrubs, Sam enjoyed a raft of appearances across some of America’s best loved comedies of the past few decades with credits on Spin City, Seinfeld, Desperate Housewives, Shameless, Modern Family and Happy Together. 
He also racked up an impressive film resume that includes parts in Galaxy Quest and Flubber. 
A warm, funny and talented man, he is survived by his wife Vanessa and son Weston, who was born in 2019.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2 (UPI) -- Sam Lloyd -- a character actor who appeared on the TV shows Scrubs, Seinfeld and The West Wing -- has died after a battle with cancer. He was 56.
ETOnline and Deadline confirmed Lloyd's Friday death with his representatives.

His other credits include Flubber, Galaxy Quest, Cougar Town, Desperate Housewives, The Middle and Modern Family.
"Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I've ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy," Scrubs star Zach Braff tweeted.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hollywood: Who Was Rock Hudson, the Real-Life Movie Star Played by Jake Picking?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In his new miniseries Hollywood, producer Ryan Murphy seeks to right some of the wrongs of the entertainment industry’s past. While the show is largely fictional, it features several real life characters, including actor Rock Hudson. With the show, Murphy hoped to revisit Hudson's stories and explore what his life and career could have been, absent the homophobia that permeated the industry. But just who was Hudson?
Born Roy Harold Scherer Jr. in 1925, Hudson was raised in the Chicago suburb of Winnetka. His father left the family when he was a young child and the boy was later adopted by his stepfather, who changed his last name to Fitzgerald. Hudson's stepfather was an abusive addict who violently discouraged the young man from acting, author Mark Griffin wrote in his recent Hudson biography All That Heaven Allows.
After graduating from high school, Hudson enlisted in the Navy and served as a mechanic in the Philippines during World War II. After leaving the service he lived in Los Angeles, reunited with his biological father and worked as a truck driver while he pursuing an acting career, the Chicago Tribune reported in his obituary.
Willson discovered Hudson in 1947 and gave him his new name, which was reportedly inspired by both the Rock of Gibraltar and the Hudson River. Willson was drawn to Hudson's height (he was 6'4") and believed he had the good looks to become a star, the Tribune recounted. After appearing in a small role in the 1948 picture Fighter Squadron, Hudson was signed to a contract with Universal-International. He appeared in a series of films in the late '40s and early '50s and moved into increasingly large roles. In 1956 he starred alongside Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean in the western Giant, for which he received an Academy Award nomination. Hudson then found a hit starring in 1959's Pillow Talk with Doris Day, a frequent co-star. He was voted the top star of the year in 1958 by Look magazine.
Willson positioned Hudson as a clean-cut '50s heartthrob and was very invested in maintaining the image of him as a straight man. Though many in Hollywood knew that Hudson was gay, Willson, who was also gay, was able to keep it out of the press by bargaining with magazines. In 1955 Hudson married Phyllis Gates, who was Willson's secretary, a coupling likely engineered by Willson, the Los Angeles Times wrote after her 2006 death. The marriage lasted three years before it ended in divorce.
When Hudson slowly fell out of the Hollywood A-list in the late '60s, he successfully transitioned to television. He starred as a police officer in the well-received series McMillan & Wife from 1971 to 1977. Heart issues, which led to bypass surgeries, hindered his career in the '80s. In 1984, he was diagnosed with AIDS; speculation about his health arose when he appeared at a press conference with Doris Day and looked dramatically different. "He was very sick," Day later said to People. "But I just brushed that off and I came out and put my arms around him and said, 'Am I glad to see you.'"
Hudson's health continued to decline and in the summer of 1985, while he was being treated at a Paris hospital, his publicist confirmed he had AIDS. That September, a Los Angeles benefit for which Elizabeth Taylor chaired raised $1 million for research. The New York Times reported that in a message read at the event, Hudson said, "I am not happy that I am sick. I am not happy that I have AIDS; but if that is helping others, I can at least know that my own misfortune has had some positive worth." Hudson donated $250,000 to launch what is now known as AMFAR. He died that October at age 59.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scrubs actor Sam Lloyd dead at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON – Scrubs star Sam Lloyd has died at the age of 56, after battling an inoperable brain tumour.
The actor, who was the nephew of actor Christopher Lloyd and played lawyer Ted Buckland in the medical comedy series, died on Thursday after battling an inoperable brain tumour.
Scrubs producer Tom Hobert and his wife previously launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for Lloyd as he battled the disease and his death was announced on the site.
They wrote: "Our dear sweet Sammy has passed away.
"On April 30th at a respiratory facility in Los Angeles with his beautiful wife, Vanessa, at his side and his sister, Laurel, FaceTiming from New Hampshire, Samuel Lloyd Jr. left this earth and was reunited with his dad (Samuel Lloyd Sr.), his mom (Marianna McGuffin), and his brother (Jackson Lloyd).
"Sam's fight began on 17 January 2019 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer that metastasized to his brain, liver, spine, and jaw. Things did not look good. After an outpouring of love from Sam's friends and people from all over the world, Sam was put on a new targeted therapy drug and had an amazing resurgence. For 13 months Sam lived life to the fullest, treasuring every moment. He saw his son, Weston, turn 1, he was able to hold his mom's hand as she took her last breath, and as Sam always loved to say, 'he made music along the way'.
"At the end of 2019, Sam found out that the targeted therapy drug which had given him such a miraculous second chance had lost its effectiveness. Determined to live, and with so much to live for, Sam fought hard, enduring multiple brain surgeries, and endless tests and procedures. Despite all these things, Sam always mustered up the strength to say "I love you" to Vanessa, Weston, and his many close friends who came to visit him.
"Eventually the fight became more intense and Sam slipped into a coma for nearly two months.
Vanessa never stopped believing that Sam would rebound and be reunited with her and Weston and all the people who love Sam so much. She stayed by his side day in and day out - even figuring out ways to visit him during the COVID restrictions.
"But alas it was time for Sam to leave this world. A world that he made a better place every day of his life.
"Rest in peace sweet, sweet Sammy boy. We loved you more than words can tell."
_Scrubs _creator Bill Lawrence wrote on Twitter: "Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scrubs actor Sam Lloyd dies at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Sam Lloyd, who was best known for playing lawyer Ted Buckland on medical comedy Scrubs, has died at the age of 56.
In January 2019, Lloyd was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour and cancer in January 2019, just weeks after his wife, Vanessa, gave birth to their first child.
Lloyd had a successful thirty-year career in TV and film, appearing in Desperate Housewives, Seinfeld, Modern Family, The West Wing, Cougar Town, Malcolm in the Middle and Shameless, and films such as Flubber and Galaxy Quest.
He was also a musician, singing in a cappella group The Blanks, who made several appearances on Scrubs as The Worthless Peons, and played bass guitar in The Butties, a Beatles tribute band. 
He was also planning to direct a country rock musical entitled With Pam and Gil, which was put on hold when he fell ill. 
Sharing a behind-the-scenes photo of Lloyd on Twitter, Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence, said, "Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many."
The late actor's Scrubs co-star Zach Braff also posted a tribute, which said, "Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I've ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together.
"He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
Braff also posted a video of Lloyd’s a cappella group singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scrubs stars pay tribute to Sam Lloyd, aka Ted Buckland, as he dies aged 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scrubs stars have been paying tribute to Sam Lloyd, after the actor died aged 56.
Lloyd, best known for playing lawyer Ted Buckland on the hospital comedy, passed away on 30 April.
While his cause of death has yet to be confirmed, he had been battling cancer, having been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour at the beginning of 2019.
He was then diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer, which had spread to his liver, spine and jaw bone.
Following the sad news, Sam’s Scrubs castmates shared tributes on social media, including Zach Braff, who played JD on the show.
The 45-year-old tweeted: ‘Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. 
‘He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy.’
Zach went on to share a clip of Sam singing Somewhere Over The Rainbow with his a capella group The Blanks, who made recurring appearances on Scrubs, as well as pictures of some of Lloyd’s most memorable scenes.
Sarah Chalke, who played Elliot Reid, tweeted: ‘Oh Sam…I feel so lucky I got the chance to know and work with you. You were the the kindest, funniest man. Sending so much love to your family. Rest In Peace.’
Series creator Bill Lawrence posted a BTS picture from the show and wrote: ‘Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many.’
He added: ‘Spent the night watching clips of Sam (The songs! The greatest sweaty pratfall of all time!) Those who reached out, our “Scrubs family” appreciates it – he had the biggest heart of all of us. 
‘But now send all those good thoughts to his family. And to your own loved ones. #RIPTed.’
Actress Kate Micucci played Ted’s girlfriend Stephanie Gooch on the show, and posted a picture with Sam to Twitter.
‘So sad to hear the news about Sam Lloyd,’ she tweeted.
‘Sam was one of the warmest, funniest and most generous actors I’ve ever worked with. I loved getting to sing with him and it was an honor to play his girlfriend on Scrubs. He will be so missed.’
Robert Maschio, who played The Todd on Scrubs, tweeted a selfie with Sam and wrote: ‘Simpler times, happier days, the kindest man I ever met. Easy going Sam, Rest In Peace.’
Meanwhile, other actors who had worked with Sam on different shows also shared their condolences.
The Masked Singer judge Ken Jeong tweeted: ‘I was just talking about Sam Lloyd and how amazing he was when he appeared on @DrKenABC. Oh man, this hurts. It was a true honor working with you. A genius and a gentleman. Rest In Peace.’
While Lloyd was best known for his role as miserable lawyer Ted, he also starred on shows including Seinfeld, The West Wing and Desperate Housewives, and reprised his role of Ted Buckland in Cougar Town. 
Lloyd is survived by his wife Vanessa and their son Weston.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Who was Henry Willson? Shrewd and predatory talent agent who 'made' Rock Hudson and Lana Turner</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A legendary talent agent of his day, Henry Willson became something of a star-maker in the Golden Age of Tinseltown.
Now in the glamorous new Netflix drama series Hollywood, The Big Bang Theory star Jim Parsons portrays the powerful and abusive Willson and his relationship with one of his greatest stars, Rock Hudson.
Born in 1911 and growing up as a rich New Yorker to a prominent showbiz family, Henry Willson was the son of Horace Willson, vice-president of the Columbia Phonograph Company and moved in Broadway circles.
Henry's interest in tap dance saw him sent to Asheville School in North Carolina by his father in a bid to have what he believed would be a positive influence on Henry.
Attending Wesleyan University in Connecticut, Willson also wrote gossip columns for Variety in New York on the weekends.
Arriving in Hollywood in 1933, Willson became friends with Bing Crosby's wife Dixie Lee, who introduced him to the highest circles of the Hollywood elite.
Initially writing for Photoplay, The Hollywood Reporter and New Movie Magazine, Willson went on to become a talent agent and moved to Beverly Hills.
A regular on the gay bars of the Sunset Strip, Henry seduced young men to make stars of them and also find pleasure.
One of his earliest clients and lovers was Trent "Junior" Durkin, whose tragic death in an automobile accident in 1935 at the age of 19 left a 23-year-old Willson grieving.
Henry soon got a job at the Zeppo Marx Agency for talent and helped make a star of Lana Turner in 1937.
After this, legendary Hollywood producer David O. Selznick hired Willson to head his talent division at Vanguard Pictures.
Making himself indispensable with the powerful titans of Hollywood and keeping tabs on their affairs both personal and business-related, Henry Willson became renowned for making and breaking careers.
He eventually opened his own talent agency, where he built up the careers of young men in exchange for sexual favours.
He made success stories out of Guy Madison, Ty Hardin, and Tab Hunter, and would eventually be credited as an architect of the new "beefcake" phase of leading men in Hollywood.
One of Rock Hudson's most renowned biographers Mark Griffin has previously discussed the role that Willson had in Hollywood and in forging Hudson's career.
Griffin explained to National Public Radio in 2018: "He was a very influential figure in Hollywood, which is interesting when you think, you know, here's a gay man who was - I wouldn't say overt, but he wasn't as closeted as some of the actors had to be.
"And he managed this platoon of sort of B-list hunks that we're now very familiar with. And this would include not only Rock but Tab Hunter, Rory Calhoun, Clint Walker. There was just a whole slew of them."
However, it became well-known around town that Willson expected sexual favours in return for his professional attention.
Griffin revealed: "I think it was fairly well-known that if you were a Henry Willson client, as Tony Curtis once expressed it, you probably had to sexually express yourself to Henry.
"So you know, here is sort of the flip side of the #MeToo movement. It's the gay casting couch, if you will. And when Rock first met Henry Willson, this is basically one of the first contacts that he had into Hollywood."
It was Henry who helped to cultivate the matinee idol image of Rock Hudson, who he had made out of a naive young Illinois-born truck driver named Roy Scherer.
Griffin describes Willson as "reconditioning" Hudson by getting him voice lessons and amp up the "butch" aspects of his appearance to match the image that Willson knew would make him a star.
According to Willson's biographer Robert Hofler in The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson: The Pretty Boys and Dirty Deals of Henry Willson , used sex as currency in Hollywood and had questionable methods for transforming his stars.
Holfer says that Willson even had a vocal trainer deliberately give Hudson a throat infection and "then instructed him to scream for hours. When his vocal chords later healed, they miraculously accommodated a deeper, more seductive speaking voice."
Willson had already had huge success stories with Lana Turner and Tab Hunter, but soon Rock Hudson became his chief professional achievement.
The talent agent went out of his way to hide Rock's closeted homosexuality, so much so that when Confidential Magazine threatened to expose Rock's gay relationships, Willson threw his other clients to the wolves in exchange for keeping it all a secret.
Tab Hunter had cut ties with Willson months prior, but the agent shared details of Calhoun's criminal past to the magazine and of how Hunter had been caught at gay party.
Griffin described: "So that's an unfortunate example of how a gay man, Henry Willson, would be willing to sell out another gay man, Tab Hunter, to save the career of a third gay man, Rock Hudson - so, interesting dynamic."
It is often reported that Willson helped bring about the marriage of the gay Hudson and Willson's own secretary Phyllis Gates.
Hudson's wife, who divorced him a few years later, claimed in her own memoir that Willson had manipulated her and Rock into marrying and that Hudson was responsible for the breakdown of their marriage.
While Willson's own sexuality was well-known in Hollywood, his homosexuality became such public knowledge that he became a bit of a social pariah.
As he fell into drink and drug abuse, his weight fluctuated and his paranoia and anger grew.
Soon Willson's clients abandoned him for fear of association with him, leaving him destitute and unemployed.
In 1972, Willson moved into the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital, where he suffered from illnesses as a result of his addictions.
He died there at the age of 67 from cirrhosis of the liver, going on to be buried in an unmarked grave in the Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery, North Hollywood, California.
Eventually, a gravestone was placed over his plot, with the epitaph reading: "Star - Star Maker".
Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Hollywood star Jim Parsons discussed his thoughts about Willson's life and how he ended up feeling sorry for the talent agent.
Parsons said: "He ended up destitute because he’d used every resource he had to get his clients to the place that he wanted them to be and that they wanted to be - paying for clothes, paying for lessons, paying for teeth - so as nasty and weird and slimy as he could be at times, I felt for him when I read he died penniless in a Styrofoam coffin."
Hollywood is out on Netflix now.

Announcing his own prize – a virtual meeting with his Avengers co-stars – Evans posted his maiden Instagram video and said: “This is a great cause, this helps get food to people who are in need during this Covid nightmare, so I am very happy to be doing this.
“Now I saw what Pratt is offering, I can’t compete with that, I can’t get you eaten by a dinosaur. But here’s what I can offer: a virtual hang out with me and five of my closest friends: Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner.”
Evans, 38, added: “We can do a private Q&A, you can ask us anything, we’ll spill the beans, then maybe some games. I would recommend Scattergories.”
He then nominated Marvel actors Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie as well as Pose star Billy Porter.
The All-In Challenge raises money for charities Meals On Wheels, No Kid Hungry and America’s Food Fund.
Other celebrities taking part include Leonardo DiCaprio, Drake and Kim Kardashian West.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lovecraft Country teaser: HBO’s horror series brings cosmic monsters and racism together</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HBO has released the teaser for horror drama television series Lovecraft Country. Based on Matt Ruff’s acclaimed eponymous novel, the series comes from Misha Green and has the blessing (and the financial backing) of Green, Jordan Peele with his Monkeypaw Productions, and JJ Abrams with his Bad Robot Productions, among others.
The story blends supernatural horror with the real-world one. As the name describes, the source material and the series will have monsters inspired by Lovecratian lore. HP Lovecraft, known for his horror and something called weird fiction, created alien godlike cosmic beings, chief and most well-known among them Cthulhu, in his works saturated with cosmic horror. That horror was not of something as mundane as ghosts but of things too profound and terrifying to comprehend.
Jonathan Majors’ Atticus Freeman joins forces with Jurnee Smollett-Bell’s Letitia and his uncle (Courtney B Vance) for a cross-country trip to find his missing father (Michael Kenneth Williams, known for HBO’s own The Wire and The Night Of). The story, as mentioned above, explores both kinds of horror — Lovecraftian and the real-world horrors like racism and white supremacism.
As expected from the cast and the creative team, the trailer of Lovecraft Country looks awesome. The entities created by Lovecraft were scarier because they were more elusive. The concept of their existence was horrifying enough, and we actually hardly saw them in his works. They operated on the sidelines, scaring the living daylights out of the characters in novels and short stories.
Let’s hope that is the case here as well.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg Developing Adult Animated Comedy 'Bubble' Based on Podcast at Sony</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are working on another animated film aimed at adult audiences in the vein of their movie “Sausage Party” by developing an adaptation of the podcast series “Bubble” for Sony Pictures Animation, an individual with knowledge of the project told TheWrap.
Rogen and Goldberg’s Point Grey Productions will produce the film along with “Jumanji: The Next Level” producer Matt Tolmach. Jordan Morris, the creator of the 2018 podcast “Bubble” hosted at Maximum Fun, will write the screenplay.
The podcast “Bubble” is a sci-fi comedy satire set in Fairhaven, a utopian city enclosed inside a bubble on an alien planet, and follows a group of hipsters who use an app not unlike Uber in order to pick up side jobs hunting monsters that swarm the planet.
The project will be a feature-length film and will be intended for mature audiences.
Kyle Hunter, Ariel Shaffir, James Weaver and David Manpearl are attached as executive producers. Maximum Fun and Jordan Morris are also attached as co-executive producers. Matt Tolmach Productions’ Camilla Grove brought the project into the studio.
Hunter, Shaffir, Rogen and Goldberg all co-wrote the screenplay for 2016’s “Sausage Party,” which was a raunchy, twisted take on something like Toy Story in which food products within a grocery store all have a life of their own and are mortified when they discover how humans consume them. Sony Pictures released “Sausage Party,” and the film earned $140.7 million at the worldwide box office on a budget of just $19 million.
Hunter, Shaffir, Tolmach and Point Grey Productions all previously worked together on the Hulu series “Future Man.”
Variety first reported the news of the project.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg to Produce ‘Bubble’, Another Animated Film For Adults</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In the United States, animation still has the reputation of being largely for children. But an entire medium of artistic expression shouldn’t be relegated to one demographic, and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are trying to help make that clear to audiences. The duo, who co-wrote and produced 2016’s outrageous animated feature Sausage Party, is getting back into animation by producing Bubble, an animated film based on the podcast of the same name. Get the details below.
According to Variety, Rogen and Goldberg – whose credits are so ingrained in the American comedy consciousness that you don’t need me to list them here – will join with Matt Tolmach (Venom, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle) to produce a Bubble movie based on the scripted comedy podcast from the popular Maximum Fun podcast network. Jordan Morris, who created the podcast, will write the film’s script, and the movie is being described as an animated film for mature audiences.
Bubble was an eight-episode podcast that began in 2018. Here’s its official description:
You can listen to all eight episodes here. Morris has writing credits on Honest Trailers, @midnight, multiple Rooster Teeth projects, the LEGO Movie spin-off series Unikitty!, and is also well-known for his podcast Jordan, Jesse, Go!, which has been running for well over a decade (it started in 2007, long before podcasts were commonplace). If this film heads to theaters, it will mark his debut theatrical feature.
Even if you haven’t seen Sausage Party, you probably remember the headlines it made upon release. Rogen and Goldberg and their team put together a truly bonkers movie in which sentient foods at a grocery store interrogate ideas of sex and religion, and the results are incredibly vulgar and surprisingly profound. I encourage you to seek out that film if you skipped it – just make sure kids aren’t in the room (unless you have a very different idea of what’s acceptable than my parents did).
This shouldn’t be nearly as controversial as Sausage Party, but I’m glad to see Rogen and Goldberg jump back into animation and continue to shatter the incorrect idea that animation is just kids’ stuff with a bone thrown to adults by Pixar every once in a while.

    <h5 class="mb-1">First trailer for HBO’s Lovecraft Country blends eldritch horrors and racism</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">H.P. Lovecraft is having a moment. January brought us Richard Stanley's surreal film, Color Out of Space, an adaptation of the short story of the same name, in which a family on a farm encounters a glowing purple meteorite with typically horrific Lovecraftian consequences. Stanley's film adaptation of The Dunwich Horror is rumored to be in development, the second in a planned trilogy. And now HBO has dropped the first trailer for a new series partly inspired by the works of the Cthulhu-loving horror master, called Lovecraft Country.
The series is based on the 2016 dark fantasy/horror novel, Lovecraft Country, by Matt Ruff, who also found inspiration in a 2006 essay by Pam Noles describing what it was like growing up being both black and, well, a hardcore nerd. The protagonist is a black veteran of the Korean War and science fiction fan named Atticus, who embarks on a perilous road trip from his home on Chicago's South Side to a small town in rural Massachusetts. He's looking for his estranged father, who purportedly vanished after encountering a well-dressed man driving a silver Cadillac.
Atticus' Uncle George and childhood friend/fellow sci-fi buff, Leti, come along for the ride. This being inspired by Lovecraft, naturally they encounter all kinds of arcane rituals, magic, shape-shifters, monsters, and an alternate reality or two along the way.
What makes Ruff's novel so ingeniously subversive is how it reflects the horrors of racism in the United States in the supernatural horrors conjured by a novelist famous for his extreme racist views. As Ars' Peter Opaskar noted in his review of Color out of Space, one reason Lovecraft has proven so difficult to adapt for modern audiences is "because he was super-racist. Like, even other racists at the time would say, 'Jesus, dude, chill.'" As Cory Doctorow observed at Boing Boing, "These characters... don't need Elder Gods to experience horror. They live it in their daily lives, through harassment, violence, expropriation, and the legacy of slavery that is anything but ancient history for them."
HBO's 10-episode adaptation seems to be hewing pretty closely to those themes. Per the official synopsis:
The trailer opens with Atticus on a bus, returning home to Chicago, where he's welcomed with open arms. We see him reunite with Leti and then discover that his father, Montrose (Michael K. Williams, aka Omar from The Wire), has gone missing. But Atticus receives a letter from his father asking to meet him in a remote location deep in "Lovecraft Country." It's a dangerous place, and not just because of the rampant racism, courtesy of a secret order known as the Sons of Adam. We are treated to dimly lit scenes of monsters on the attack, along with Jim Crow-era scenes of escalating racially charged violence. One might conclude, along with Leti: "I thought the world was one way and found out it isn't."
Lovecraft Country premieres on HBO in August 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">JK Rowling donates £1 million to charity to help vulnerable during pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JK Rowling is donating £1 million to charity to help the most vulnerable in society during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Harry Potter author usually marks the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts – the showdown between Harry and the Hogwarts students and Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters in the final book, The Deathly Hallows – on 2 May each year.
However, she decided it would be ‘inappropriate’ to discuss the fictional deaths that occurred in the Harry Potter books while the country is in crisis.
The 54-year-old tweeted: ‘Today’s the 22nd anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, but I’m going to be honest and say that it feels inappropriate to talk about fictional deaths today. Too many people are losing loved ones in the real world. 
Read updates: Coronavirus news live
‘So on this anniversary of a great wizarding victory, I’m thinking of the people who’re out there doing their jobs to protect us and our way of life. I have 3 key workers in my immediate family, and like all such relatives, I’m torn between pride and anxiety.’
The author – believed to be worth £700 million – went on to confirm she would be making a donation to Crisis and Refuge, to help the homeless and victims of domestic abuse. 
Rowling wrote: ‘As ever in a crisis of this sort, the poorest and most vulnerable are hit hardest, so in honour of the Battle of Hogwarts, I’ll be making a donation of £1m, half of which will go to https://crisis.org.uk, who’re helping the homeless during the pandemic, and half of which will go to https://refuge.org.uk, because we know that domestic abuse has, sadly, increased hugely during the lockdown.’
Chief executive of Refuge Sandra Horley CBE stated that domestic abuse could potentially increase during lockdown, with people spending more time at home with their abusers.
A statement read: ‘1.6 million women experienced domestic abuse last year, and self-isolation has the potential to aggravate pre-existing abusive behaviours by perpetrators.
‘While in lockdown or self-isolation, women and children are likely to be spending concentrated periods of time with perpetrators, potentially escalating the threat of domestic abuse and further restricting their freedom.
‘Domestic abuse isn’t always physical – it’s a pattern of controlling, threatening and coercive behaviour, which can also be emotional, economic, psychological or sexual. Abuse is a choice a perpetrator makes, and isolation is already used by many perpetrators as a tool of control.
‘In the current climate, it is certainly more challenging for women suffering abuse. Lines of communication could be severely limited if women are unable to leave the home.’
Rowling had been ‘reminded’ by a fan on 1 May that the Battle of Hogwarts was coming up, to which she responded with a shout-out to the birthday of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour’s daughter – who was called Victoire, French for victory, because of the day her birth fell on.
The writer – who lost her billionaire status due to her charity donations – tweeted: ‘Also Victoire Weasley-née- Delacour’s birthday, but that gets overshadowed. I feel bad for her. The wizarding equivalent of being born on Christmas Day and christened Holly.’
The creator of the wizarding world of Harry Potter has been active on social media during lockdown, responding to fan art and also launching Harry Potter At Home to keep kids entertained.

“Today's the 22nd anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, but I'm going to be honest and say that it feels inappropriate to talk about fictional deaths today. Too many people are losing loved ones in the real world. 1/4
“So on this anniversary of a great wizarding victory, I'm thinking of the people who're out there doing their jobs to protect us and our way of life. I have 3 key workers in my immediate family, and like all such relatives, I'm torn between pride and anxiety. 2/4
“As ever in a crisis of this sort, the poorest and most vulnerable are hit hardest, so in honour of the Battle of Hogwarts, I'll be making a donation of £1m, half of which will go to crisis.org.uk, who're helping the homeless during the pandemic 3/4
“and half of which will go to refuge.org.uk, because we know that domestic abuse has, sadly, increased hugely during the lockdown. 4/4”
May 2 is the day on which Harry Potter defeated Lord Voldemort and his followers in the Harry Potter books. The final battle at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry resulted in the deaths of many fan favorite characters, and in previous years, Rowling took to Twitter every May 2 to apologize for one of these deaths:
Even last year, many thought Rowling had forgotten to post an apology, but eagle-eyed fans spotted a change in her cover photo, presumed to symbolize an apology for the death of Sirius Black in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix:
Fans have reacted to Rowling’s break from tradition with gratitude, with many saying that they also plan to donate after seeing her announcement.
In December 2019, Rowling was awarded a Ripple of Hope R.F. Kennedy Human Rights award. To help fans, families and teachers through the COVID-19 crisis, Rowling announced the launch of her Harry Potter at Home hub, dedicated to providing free resources to those reading the Harry Potter series, including offering the first Harry Potter eBook and audiobook for free.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The ultimate house party is going down on May 2. Nickelodeon will air its first-ever Kids’ Choice Awards 2020: Celebrate Together special to benefit No Kid Hungry. The special will be hosted by Victorious alum Victoria Justice. The winners of the 2020 KCAs will be revealed during the special and stars like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, BTS, the Avengers: Endgame cast and more will make appearances. The KCAs were originally scheduled for March 22, but the awards show was canceled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. HollywoodLife talked with Victoria ahead of the special about why it was important to still have the KCAs this year.
“I think the Kids’ Choice Awards bring a lot of joy to people and a lot of joy to kids,” Victoria said. “Even though we’re living in crazy times and we can’t do the whole big awards show because it’s obviously not safe right now and not smart to do, I think Nickelodeon is getting creative and people that are doing all these sorts of shows are so getting creative so why not the honor these people, why not so have fun with it and, and bring some light and some laughter and some slime to people’s living rooms. Even though I am hosting from my own home, I think it’s still going to be really fun. It’s going to be a unique KCAs for sure.”
The Kids’ Choice Awards is without a doubt the most fun awards show every year. Even though the KCAs will be from home this year, kids can still expect it to be a blast. “It’s going to be creative, and it’s going to be a little different,” Victoria continued. “I think it’s going to be cool for people to see because they voted for these people from their homes, and we’re going to get to see them accepting the award from their home. I think it’s just like a really unique perspective and experience and one that we won’t forget.”
When you talk about the KCAs, you have to talk about slime. The Kids’ Choice Awards may look a little different this year, but there will always be slime. “I always have to be a little discreet when talking about the slime because I don’t want to give too much away. That’s always a fun surprise. But I will say that there definitely is slime involved. It’s really fun,” Victoria teased. Nickelodeon’s Kids’ Choice Awards 2020: Celebrate Together special will air at 8 p.m. on Nickelodeon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Donald Glover, Billy Eichner, Idina Menzel Join Disney’s Family Singalong: Volume II</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Having realized famous people love belting out their favorite Disney songs as much as us plebeians, the Disney Family Singalong: Volume II has been announced for Sunday, May 10 at 7 p.m. EST on ABC. While Ariana Grande and Beyoncé stole the singalong last time, only time will tell whose vocals will go from (not any where near) zero to (your personal quarantine) hero.
The celebrities and musicians singing next Sunday will include Chloe x Halle, Billy Eichner, Hayley Erbert, Halsey, Josh Gad, Donald Glover, Derek Hough, Julianne Hough, Idina Menzel, Miguel, Keke Palmer, Ben Platt, Seth Rogen, Anika Noni Rose, Walter Russell III, Rebel Wilson, and Shakira, not to mention Broadway stars like Merle Dandridge, Heather Headley, Adam Jacobs, Caissie Levy, Kara Lindsay, Kevin Massey, and Josh Strickland. 
Check out the hour-long special’s tracklist below, but keep in mind, more famous people will likely sign up before long. They better hurry and call dibs, though. No one wants to be the celebrity stuck scaring kids with The Hunchback of Notre Dame’s “Hellfire” or some such.
“A Whole New World” – Idina Menzel and Ben Platt“Almost There” – Chloe x Halle and Anika Noni Rose“Hakuna Matata” – Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner featuring Donald Glover and Walter Russell III“Part of Your World” – Halsey“Poor Unfortunate Souls” – Rebel Wilson“Remember Me” - Miguel“Step in Time” and “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” – Derek Hough, Julianne Hough and Hayley Erbert“Try Everything” – Shakira“When I Am Older” – Josh Gad“You’ll Be in My Heart” – Disney on Broadway stars Merle Dandridge, Heather Headley, Adam Jacobs, Caissie Levy, Kara Lindsay, Kevin Massey and Josh Strickland“Zero to Hero” – Keke Palmer

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If anything and everything Disney is the name of the game in your household, you're in luck. ABC is premiering a Disney Family Singalong: Volume II at 7 p.m. ET on Sunday, May 10 — aka Mother's Day! And as with the first singalong, it'll be hosted by Ryan Seacrest and will feature engaging performances of songs from beloved Disney movies and shows by celebrities and Broadway stars.
According to Entertainment Weekly, the evening's lineup will include an eclectic mix. Little Mermaid fans won't want to miss Idina Menzel and Ben Platt singing "A Whole New World," Halsey belting out an indie rendition of "Part of Your World," or Rebel Wilson's version of "Poor Unfortunate Souls". If The Lion King is more your speed, tune in for Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan performing "Hakuna Matata" featuring Donald Glover. Pixar lovers can enjoy Miguel singing "Remember Me" from Coco and Shakira will sing "Try Everything" from Zootopia. For a tribute to the Disney classic Mary Poppins, Julianne Hough, Derek Hough, and Hayley Erbert will perform a "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and "Step in Time" medley.
Keep in mind that your family can stream the first singalong performance on Disney+ now — so you can make sure the kiddos practice their favorite tunes before Mother's Day!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Outlander author Diana Gabaldon has penned season five’s penultimate episode…and fans are ecstatic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OUTLANDER author Diana Gabaldon has sent fans crazy this weekend - after revealing she penned this weekend's episode of the hit drama.
The Fraser family have faced plenty of heartbreak in this season, but it looks like things might be looking up - with the much-anticipated "microscope scene" set to appear in the show's penultimate episode.
It comes as Diana Gabaldon took to social media to thanks the show's stars for a "wonderful performance" ahead of the episode.
Diana wrote: "Should be exciting! Thanks for a wonderful performance!"
Earlier, Starz made the announcement on social media after teasing a dramatic penultimate episode for fans.
They wrote: "YES @Writer_DG wrote Sunday's episode and YES it does involve a certain microscope scene.
"Are we excited yet?!"
Fans couldn't get enough of the announcement, with some revealing they "couldn't wait".
One fan wrote: "You literally have NO IDEA how excited I am."
While another said: "I know it's gonna be great if Herself wrote it!"
And one Twitter user added: "Worth the wait. I think this will be a wild ride!! And we will ride it together!!"
The show is set to broadcast the first of its two final episodes this weekend in the US. The UK broadcast is set for Monday on Amazon Prime.
It comes after Brianna faced down Stephen Bonnet last weekend - leaving fans on the edge of their seat.
We previously told how Graham McTavish had made his return to the hit time travel drama - in the most unlikeliest of ways.
And Graham was not the only surprise casting in the new series.
Scots were also amazed after spotting a Still Game favourite in the opening episode of the hit drama.
Mark Cox delighted fans - by playing a pastor at Roger and Bree's wedding.
It came after co-star Sam Heughan confirmed that work was continuing on him and Graham McTavish's new show Clan Lands amid the coronavirus pandemic.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans of The Wedding Planner are about to be reminded why the movie is so damn great.
Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey fell in love onscreen in the romantic comedy, and anyone that's ever wished they'd return for a sequel should prepare themselves. In a new Twitter exchange, McConaghey and Lopez hinted that they loved making the movie, so there's most definitely hope of a reunion.
During the weekly series, McConaughey Takes, the Oscar winner revealed how he got involved in the movie. He said, "Jennifer was already cast, they were looking for the male lead. I think we were coming up against a writers strike. So, what that means is the issue was trying to get as many movies made as quickly as possible… the industry needed content." As a result, the actor was able to negotiate a great deal to play the part of Dr. Steve Edison in The Wedding Planner.

As for working with Hustlers icon J.Lo, McConaughey said, "I’ve always called her a quad threat. What does she not do? That girl works her backside off on everything. She does not just show up and wing it at all. She’s like clockwork. Just hammers it and knocks it out."
Lopez was clearly thrilled by McConaughey's endorsement, as she retweeted his video, and wrote, "@McConaughey let’s do it again soon!" She ended her tweet with a winking emoji and sparkles.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rising Star Charles Lott Jr.: “Actors shouldn’t be afraid to stand up! If you see something wrong with our industry say something; cause awareness”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I had the pleasure to interview Charles Lott Jr. Charles is best known for his upcoming role in the feature film THE WAY BACK alongside Hollywood-veteran Ben Affleck. THE WAY BACK is set to premiere March 6, 2020. From early on, Charles Lott Jr. has been successful from his scene work, monologue performances, and modeling on the runway. In addition to national commercials and campaigns with Vitamin Water, Charles has booked roles in “Modern Family,” “68 Whiskey,” FORGIVENESS, and EXTRA CREDIT (2020).
Thank you so much for doing this with us! Can you tell us the story of how you grew up?
For the most part pretty good. I was raised in a two-parent household with all of my siblings. Of course, I’ve had some tough times in my life, but overall I eat every day, I have clothes on my back, and I have people around me that love me. If I have those things I feel as if I have nothing to complain about because there are so many people on this earth that will kill to have a life that I have.
Can you share a story with us about what brought you to this specific career path?
It’s so crazy because I never tried to be an actor. My whole life I tried to make it in professional sports. I wanted to be a football player, I wanted to go to the NFL and be a first-round draft pick like most other boys that play the sport. I got signed to an agent and manager for a talent competition I won on accident and I still didn’t want to act. People have always told me that I should get into acting and that I was always a character. I always had a big personality and I should display that to the world but I wasn’t thinking big enough when my senior year started. I got a lot of injuries so college coaches stopped calling, and I didn’t know what to do. I called my dad and asked him what does he think if I got into acting again and he supported the whole way through. I never hated acting, I was just so caught up into the “football is life” thing and once my run was over I got more realistic, and I just wanted to be a kid. The acting was the better choice and the best choice I’ve ever made because I fell in love with it. I’m still mad to this day that I didn’t get into it earlier.
Can you tell us the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?
It was a few weeks before Christmas. While we were shooting the movie, and Al Madrigal who is in the movie with me invited me to a Christmas party at his house. He told me out of all the kids in the group that he only invited me and don’t tell any of the other kids, so I didn’t. He also invited some of the older guys from the set. I got a ride with my co-star Jeremy Radin and we went into the house together. Madrigal’s house was extremely huge and elegant. I noticed very quickly I was the only black person in the party. Jeremy and I walked out into Al’s big and ginormous backyard, and I told him, “Man I’m the only black dude in an all-white party this feels like I’m in the movie Get Out” and literally three seconds later there was a knock on the door. Al walked and opened it and guess who it is, Jordan Peele! I completely freaked out! I still can’t believe I called it, Bill Burr was there I freaked, Dave Holstein was there and I almost had a seizure, he created one of my favorite shows “Kidding” with Jim Carrey. That might’ve easily been the best party I’ve been to.
Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?
This will be my answer till the day I die, getting Ben Affleck to “adopt me.” It was our first scene together with him and the other guys on the team. The scene where they introduce him to the team, and the first time we ran it through I got ready to say my line and he cut mine and started his right away. I didn’t know if he did it on purpose or not (probably not) so I didn’t say anything. After a few tapes of me not being able to get my line out, I got angry. The first words that came out of my mouth were “Oh hell Nah” so I walked over where he was sitting while he was on his phone. I tapped his shoulder and told him don’t step on my lines again. He looked up at me like “who is this kid” he frowned a bit. And once I realized how big and statuesque he was. I had got very frightened and put the script in his face and tried to show him what his lines were. And I forget I was mic’d up, so the guys in the back heard me, everyone gave me hell for days and said, “you don’t talk to Ben Affleck like that!” And when our next scene came around again days later, he told me how he respected me for telling him not to step on his lines. We became best friends I would ask him 100–200 questions a day from that point on. Al Madrigal told him “Since you love him so much you might as well adopt him” and he did. Now he calls me his “son” and I call him “dad.” The best story ever am I right!? Batman is my father.
What are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now?
I have two screenplays that I am working on. I am finished with one and currently editing the other. The second one I am 60 pages in and they’re both comedies!
I’m very interested in diversity in the entertainment industry. Can you share three reasons with our readers about why you think it’s important to have diversity represented in film and television? How can that potentially affect our culture?
1. It will help the younger generations. Two years ago I saw a movie called Black Panther and I was mesmerized seeing a black superhero. He looked like me, he sounded like me, he acted like me. He was so relatable to the black community. He was strong and fierce, it was an exhilarating experience. Growing up most superheros I saw were white. Seeing white men as powerful and strong did not have the same effect as Black Panther. I was 17 when I saw the film and imagined the hope and inspiration for young black boys and girls felt. Superheroes aren’t real and they do the impossible, but seeing a person like you doing the impossible makes you feel like you can do anything. A lot of white people might not understand it because everyone they watch on TV, for the most part, looks like them. They don’t know what it feels like to have a lack of representation. But growing up seeing that could potentially move mountains, and I commend Hollywood for making a push for more diverse characters.
2. They can start helping minorities and people of color be exposed to more roles. If you look 30–40 years ago people of color would only be cast for stereotypical roles. But now we see minorities being able to play anything and it gives the audience and the industry a chance to see more talent come in from all races. Let me tell you it’s been a pleasure to watch. So many new talented black, white, Mexican, Asian, etc. actors and actresses come out.
3. Having diversity would be normalized years from now if we continue to push for more diverse roles and representation. We won’t be mad or shocked if we see Idris Elba playing “007.” The people won’t be mad if Halle Bailey is cast to play Ariel in The Little Mermaid. We will only be going by the actor’s talent, not what color their skin is. Period pieces would have to be accurate, but having diversity in films is so important to me. I’m so happy to see Hollywood making an effort for change. Things don’t happen overnight, it takes time.
From your personal experience, can you recommend three things the community/society/the industry can do help address some of the diversity issues in the entertainment business?
There are so many things that need to be done but it’s hard to just narrow it down to three. But, I would say the community and society need to be more open-minded. Don’t judge a book by its cover, there have been a lot of people cast for roles that society didn’t like and they absolutely killed their roles.
Heath Ledger for example, when he got cast for The Dark Knight people were screaming, “they cast the 10 Things I Hate About You guy!?” And look, he’s easy, at least in my eyes, the greatest Joker ever. They’re getting a lot better but, Hollywood needs to be more open-minded.
The last one for me is the actors shouldn’t be afraid to stand up! If you see something wrong with our industry say something, cause awareness. Don’t feel scared to be the first, actors and actresses to take responsibility too. It’s our industry, we can’t sit around and hope someone creates diversity for us.
What are your “5 things I wish someone told me when I first started” and why. Please share a story or example for each.
I don’t have any I wish someone told me moments. I’m fairly new at this. I do not regret any decision I have made. It made me who I am today sometimes it doesn’t seem good to make decisions that don’t pan out but it’s actually a good thing, it builds character!
Which tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them to thrive and not “burn out”?
This is a heartbreak profession when you sign up to be an actor or actress. You have to know that most times when you get an audition. Statistically, you are most likely to not get the part than to book it. But acting is like baseball your swing and a strikeout, and strikeout, and strikeout, then BOOM! you hit a home run. You have to be ready to grind and be persistent and resilient. If not you will quit immediately. You have to be used to being told no more than yes.
You are a person of enormous influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. 🙂
Oh my gosh, where do I start? Black Lives Matter, Slow Food Movement, Children, and Nature movement, One Million Women movement, Keep the Oil In The Ground movement, Idle No More movement, Save the Turtles, Save the Rhinoceros, I can keep going on!
None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?
Right now, my dad. He has been there 100% through my mission of becoming an actor. He has supported me. A few weeks ago I told him I needed a laptop for my screenplay the next day he bought me one. It’s great to see him do everything he can to help me accomplish my dreams and will do whatever it takes for me to succeed.
Can you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?
It’s not really a quote but a story. You have two gold miners under the ground digging for gold. You have one guy that kept digging, kept digging, and kept digging and one day he just had enough of it. He decided to quit because he’s put all his effort into one thing and has gotten zero results, and he was ONE more big hit away from finding the gold. The other guy stayed persistent, kept digging, kept grinding, and next thing you know all of the gold he was looking for was found AND some. The moral of the story is never quit what you’re doing because you never know how close you really are to achieving your dream!
Is there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this, especially if we tag them 🙂
This is so hard to narrow it down to one person but if I had to pick one it would be Will Smith. I’ve loved that man since I was a kid. If I could have anyone’s career it would be his. Another would be Jordan Peele. He’s an amazing director I would love to work with him in the near future.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Have a Good Trip’ Trailer: Sting, Nick Offerman, and More Teach Us About Psychedelics in Netflix Documentary</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What would it be like to trip with Sting? You probably won’t be able to experience that, but you can hear Sting talk about his craziest trip in Have a Good Trip, Netflix’s new comedic documentary featuring a bunch of celebrities, including Adam Scott, Nick Offerman, Sarah Silverman, and more talking about psychedelics.
Donick Cary directs a very unusual documentary with Have a Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics, a partly scripted investigation into psychedelics and the eye-opening hallucinations they cause. Featuring star-studded re-enactments and surreal animation, Have a Good Trip promises to be more educational and entertaining, featuring interviews with celebrities like Sting, Sarah Silverman, Nick Offerman, Adam Scott, Ad-Rock, Rosie Perez, A$AP Rocky, Paul Scheer, Nick Kroll, RobCorddry, and more as they recount their weirdest and craziest trips. A few of the comedians lend their comedy chops to the documentary with re-enactments and faux lectures about the nature of psychedelics and how many mushrooms is too many.
Have a Good Trip looks like an unusual documentary — less a straightforward reporting of facts and more a comedic exercise for celebrities to talk about drugs without getting in trouble. But at the same time, it may be a way to learn about psychedelics while getting in a few laughs. No acid needed.
Here’s the synopsis for Have a Good Trip:
Have a Good Trip premieres on Netflix on May 11, 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">25 things you didn’t know about Toronto Raptors jerseys</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I lied. Sorta.
Maybe you will know some of the facts you’re about to read. Or maybe you’re like me — older than every Toronto Raptor player and growing quite forgetful. Regardless, you clicked and now I’ve got your attention!
It’s Sports Jersey Week here at SB Nation. What better way to celebrate the occasion than by looking back on 25 seasons of Toronto Raptors jerseys. There have been odd colour combinations, homages to the past, and all kinds of special edition jerseys to roll through Scotiabank Arena. With 25 seasons in the book, it only felt right to re-visit some interesting facts about the one-time Barney uniforms!
1. The inaugural Raptors jersey was to be the “Happy Meal box of jerseys.”
When John Bitove sat down with NBA Creative Director, Tom O’Grady, to create the inaugural logo and jersey, he wanted the design to appeal to women, kids, and new Canadians. Toronto was very much a hockey town, so Bitove wanted to go in a different direction with the Raptors, “Let the old white guys follow hockey, but we’re going to get the next generation.” He wanted O’Grady to create something that elicited the same feelings children associated to Disney World (Mickey Mouse) and McDonald’s (Happy Meal).
2. O’Grady drew inspiration from the Charlotte Hornets logo
He appealed to the cartoon look of the Hornet and especially liked the use of teal. That was a big reason why the original sketches included some vibrant, rarely utilized colours.
3. Dye sublimation played a huge role in the jersey’s design
The Raptors joined the league during the rise of dye sublimation — printing images directly onto the jersey, instead of stitching. This allowed O’Grady more creative space to make Bitove’s wishes a reality.
4. Original logo had a lime green Raptor
The logo that was eventually chosen had two differences from the initial sketch. While Bitove loved the original logo that had a lime green Raptor, he was pressured to add some Canadian flair. The Raptor was changed to “Canadian Red” and the Toronto Raptors lettering was changed from bronze to “Naismith Silver” (named after basketball inventor and Canadian, James Naismith)
5. Inaugural designs were not meant to last this long
Bitove’s insistence with O’Grady to come up with unusual designs was another way of distancing the franchise from the Leafs blue & white. Hindsight is 20/20, but Bitove ironically stated, “We can cycle out of this. We don’t have to have this uniform in 25 years.”
6. When choosing the team name, “Raptors” wasn’t even a finalist
When Toronto won their bid for a basketball franchise, the organization launched a contest allowing fans to suggest a team name. Hundreds of submissions came in and fan voting whittled the list down to 10 finalists. Hold on a moment. According to Bitove, in an interview with Global News, there were actually nine finalists — Beavers, Bobcats, Dragons, Grizzlies, Hogs, Scorpions, T-Rex, Tarantulas, and Terriers.
Bitove liked T-Rex the best, but his son Brett, who was eight years old at the time, had another idea. “He said to me, ‘Dad, why don’t you like raptors?” He added “Raptors” to the list of finalists.
7. Raptors make NBA jersey history
You’ve seen sports versions of camouflage uniforms in the MLB, NCAA (football and basketball), and even the NHL. The Raptors became the first team in NBA history to don the camo look. On March 21, 2017, Canadian Forces Night showed support to the Canadian military... and inadvertently set an NBA first!
8. Raptors DON’T make NBA jersey history
Considering America’s love for their troops, it was surprising to learn that Toronto was the first to use a camouflage jersey. Equally surprising, the Raptors were not the first team to rock Chinese New Year jerseys! Golden State Warriors, Houston Rockets, and Washington Wizards all joined the Raptors in commemorating the lunar new year.
9. Huskies throwback doesn’t capture all of the mid-40’s
Toronto did a great job of recapturing their basketball roots with the Huskies jersey. Unfortunately, they couldn’t also include other promotional activities from the 1946-47 season, like $2.50 courtside seats or free admission for anyone taller than the Huskies’ tallest player, George Nostrand (6’8”)!
10. In the 2006-07 season, Andrea Bargnani’s jersey ranked 8th among NBA jersey sales in Europe
Sales in Europe obviously skew towards European players, but it’s still quite surprising to Bargnani’s above names like Carmelo Anthony and Tracy McGrady.
11. The Raptors jersey with the longest tenure are the Red away jerseys
These debuted in 2004 and were used as alternates until 2006, where they officially became the team’s away jersey until 2015.
12. Champions on the court. Not quite champions off the court.
After claiming the franchise’s first championship, jersey sales unsurprisingly rose for the Raptors. Unfortunately, their franchise-record ranking of fourth still lags behind the Lakers, Celtics, and Sixers.
13. But actually also champions off the court!
The NBA Store reported record-breaking sales numbers after the Raptors won the championship. Sales for championship gear was double(!) what Golden State fans amassed the previous season. Sure, Warriors fans had a dynasty worth of championship gear already, but the Raptors’ numbers get better. The Raptors set a championship day record for sales in the NBA Store, thrashing the previous record (2016 Warriors) by 80 percent!
14. The most used jersey number is #1 with 14 players.
# 1 - Tracy McGrady, Chris Childs, Chris Jefferies, Rod Strickland, Omar Cook, P.J. Tucker, Primoz Brezec, Roko Ukic, Jarrett Jack, Justin Dentmon, Dominic McGuire, Jason Thompson, Patrick McCaw, Paul Watson
15. Actually, jersey #3 also had 14 players.
Sorry, I had to fact-check that LaMark Baker was a real name of a real Toronto Raptor.
# 3 - Zan Tabak, Chauncey Billups, LaMark Baker, Haywood Workman, Tracy Murray, Loren Woods, Juan Dixon, Marcus Banks, Hassan Adams, Gary Forbes, Kyle Lowry, Nando De Colo, James Johnson, OG Anunoby
16. What do Charles Oakley and Hakeem Olajuwon have in common?
They both wore #34. A jersey number that’s currently not in use, Mr Antetokounmpo.
17. Matt Thomas should probably change his jersey number
Only 3 players have worn #16 — Matt Bonner, Peja Stojakovic, and Steve Novak. It only makes sense that Thomas joins the list of Raptors sharpshooters to don the number.
18. The number nine was not so fine before Serge Ibaka came to shine
There were nine players to wear #9 before Ibaka. It’s an unsightly bunch of failed forwards including Sharone Wright, Tony Massenburg, Roy Rogers, Kornel David, Pape Sow, Maceo Baston, Joey Dorsey, and Rasual Butler (RIP).
19. At least 13 different players have worn multiple Raptors jersey numbers
There may be more (there I go, lying again), so feel free to comment below with anyone I missed. Players with multiple jersey numbers as Raptors: Rafer Alston (11, 12), Maceo Baston (9, 14), Mengke Bateer (14, 42), Martin Lewis (32, 44), Kyle Lowry (3, 7), Oliver Miller (2, 30), Tracy Murray (3, 35), Carlos Rogers (33, 34), Reggie Slater (24, 35), PJ Tucker (1, 2), Alvin Williams (20, 22), and Sharone Wright (4, 9). If you were keeping track, you’d have noticed only 12 names were listed.
20. James Johnson is the only Raptors player to wear three different jersey numbers
In 2011, he debuted as a Raptor wearing # 0. In 2012, he switched to #2. After brief stints in Sacramento and Memphis, he returned to Toronto sporting the number 3 jersey.
21. The most common name on the back of Raptors’ jerseys was....
Williams. Eight to be exact. Aaron, Alvin, Eric, Herb, Jerome, Lou, Michael, and Walt make up the largest contingency of a specific last name to don a Raptors jersey. The next closest was Johnson (Amir, James, Linton, Stanley, and Trey).
22. The arrival of a saviour
When the Raptors acquired The Klaw, he was the first Leonard (Kawhi) to don a Raptors jersey. The only other Lenard (Voshon) also wore #2.
23. Maybe nicknames on the back of jerseys isn’t a bad idea after all
The longest name printed on the back of a Raptors jersey in franchise history is Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. The 15 letters on his jersey back easily outnumber the 11 in Jonas Valanciunas’ jersey. RHJ likely won’t be on the team for the 2021-22 season when the Raptors had the 13 letters of Giannis Antetokounmpo.
24. Drake had someone drive from New York to deliver the infamous Dell Curry Toronto Raptors jersey.
A Dell Curry Toronto Raptors jersey is not the type of apparel Mitchell & Ness has lying around. When the Raptors booked their date with Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors, Drake started the search for Dell’s jersey. A pair of jersey aficionados (Al Martinello and Evan Flores) in New York were able to find him the jersey (signed too). The owner of the jersey (Benjamin Weil) didn’t want to part with it, so Drake had to pay handsomely. With such a short turnaround — and not trusting priority shipping — Martinello and Flores drove 10 hours to Toronto, ensuring Drake would be able to troll the Curry’s in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.
25. We talking ‘bout practice???
The Raptors and OVO collaborated to sell practice gear, including jerseys, pants, and hoodies. According to Forbes, it’s the NBA’s first practice jersey sponsorship. It probably won’t be the last because when the practice gear was released on November 20, 2019, the entire collection sold out in 10 minutes! The wait list exceeded 7,000 people. You could probably get Leafs season tickets first.. or probably not.
There you have it! The evolution of the Toronto Raptors jersey is filled with quirky anecdotes and the occasional odd design choices. The journey that started with a lime green dinosaur and Barney jokes, continues today with record-breaking sales and a gold patch on the back.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I'm here to tell you that it is Saturday, even though I almost had to check the calendar to make sure. It almost feels like 2020 is one day, a day we just keep taking power naps through. I hope you're all keeping well and finding your own sense of routine, whatever it may be. But still, it is the weekend, and I hope that you all have a good one.This week, I've been bouncing between several games. I've been breaking ribs in the excellent Streets of Rage 4, hoping to come across new secrets. Really, I just want to keep seeing amazing combat cop Estel Aguirre, who I basically want to "be." Not just in SoR 4, but in real life. I've also been searching for missing "Bromides" (that's photographs to you and I) inSakura Wars, and I also ran through Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered on Veteran. Still got it.But enough about me. What are you playing right now? After a few dry weeks, we're almost spoiled for choice with SoR 4, Sakura Wars, XCOM, Predator: Hunting Grounds, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Gears Tactics, and other recent hits such as Resident Evil 3 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. A lot of fun times there, that's for sure. So fill us in on the action. You are always among friends here.Have a safe and restful weekend, from all of us at Destructoid.Please keep major spoilers for recent games out of the comments, thanks!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The weekend is for making apple butter out of my abundance of farm share apples, just in time to get more apples and have to figure out what to do with those. It’s also for playing video games.
I went on a rant about how great Euro Truck Simulator 2 is to a Jalopnik colleague this week, which has got me hankering to play. Driving around virtual cities feels like a nice treat these days. I’m also still on the Fortnite grind, hoping to get that butch cat skin before the season ends.
What about you? What are you playing this weekend?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rishi Kapoor obituary</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rishi Kapoor, who has died aged 67 of bone marrow cancer, starred as a leading man in almost 100 Bollywood films and was a member of the remarkable Kapoor family of actors and film-makers.
The son of the great director, producer and actor Raj Kapoor, Rishi started as a child actor, aged three, in his father’s hugely popular film Shree 420 (1955). But his proper debut came in Raj’s 1970 film Mera Naam Joker, playing the younger version of his father’s leading role. Rishi said that his father only gave him the part as he was unable to pay for a recognised star, and the film was not a commercial success in any case. The movie that gave Rishi stardom was his next, Bobby (1973), the story of a love affair between Raja, a rich Bombay teenager, and a poor girl, Bobby, from the wrong side of the tracks, played by Dimple Kapadia. In the story, also directed by Raj, he was Hindu and she was Catholic, which was in itself a bold move.
Despite this the film was a sensation, becoming hugely successful at the Indian box office and earning vast sums of money in the Soviet Union. It was said that more than 60 million people saw Bobby in the USSR and the film is regarded as one of the all-time Bollywood greats, regularly shown in cinemas and on television.Rishi, who won the Hindi film industry’s Filmfare award for best actor for the role, was always a modest man and complained that the award was all very well but that it had cost him a considerable bribe to get it. Latterly he explained that he was never quite sure whether the money (30,000 rupees) was paid to the right person or whether it was a giant con. Nonetheless, he was now a major star and through the 1970s and 80s he appeared in dozens of films, including Kabhi Kabhie (1976), a romantic drama noted for its award-wining soundtrack, Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), a comedy that makes a case for religious tolerance, and the reincarnation thriller Karz (1980), with its chart-topping, disco-inspired soundtrack. These were often shot simultaneously, which meant that, arriving on the set, Rishi had to enquire exactly who he was playing and what were the lines and songs he had to accomplish.
At the turn of the century he played character roles to acclaim in another series of successful films. He was honoured with the Filmfare lifetime achievement award in 2008, and went on to win the Filmfare critics’ award as best actor for Do Dooni Chaar (2010) and best supporting actor for Kapoor & Sons (2016). His last film appearance was in The Body (2019).
Born in Bombay (now Mumbai), to Raj and Krishna (nee Malhotra), Rishi, who attended Campion school in the city, and Mayo College, in Ajmer, Rajasthan, was destined for the movies. His grandfather Prithviraj Kapoor was a pioneer of Indian theatre and early cinema, and the father of the Bollywood greats Shammi and Shashi Kapoor, as well as Raj. Rishi’s uncles on his mother’s side, including Prem Nath and Prem Chopra, were actors, as are his brothers, Randhir and Rajiv. In 1974, while shooting the film Zehreela Insaan, he began dating his co-star, Neetu Singh, and they married in 1980.
If Rishi had the advantage of being from a glamorous family that commanded immense respect in the entertainment world over three generations, he made his way without expecting any favours. In recent years he was often in considerable pain from his illness, but retained his good humour. He was also never afraid to be controversial, often saying that religion and eating were separate from each other, which was why he was “a beef-eating Hindu”. This caused considerable outrage in some quarters. But he was a charming man and, though not a great actor, possessed charisma that almost always carried him through.
In a way, Rishi was representative of the old Bollywood that has now virtually disappeared in favour of an industry that espouses new techniques and more relevant themes. Yet nobody could claim him as an old-fashioned star. His progression from male leads to character studies was remarkable for a range that not only kept him his fans but constantly broadened his appeal. And it has to be said that few Bollywood stars were regarded with more affection.
He is survived by Neetu, their son, Ranbir, who is also an actor, and daughter, Riddhima, a granddaughter, and Randhir and Rajiv.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rishi Kapoor was full of positivity: Sharmaji Namkeen producer on veteran actor’s last film</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bollywood veteran Rishi Kapoor was never the one to mention his illness and was always full of positive attitude, says filmmaker Honey Trehan as he fondly remembers working with the actor on his last film, Sharmaji Namkeen.
Kapoor died at the age of 67 on April 30 after a two year long battle with leukaemia at H N Reliance hospital in south Mumbai.
The film is produced by Excel Entertainment in association with Trehan and Abhishek Choubey under their banner MacGuffin Pictures. It is directed by the debutant Hitesh Bhatia.
“It is a coming-of-age story of a 60-year-old man. It is about a middle-class man who wants to discover life after retirement. This film was meant for him, he is the DNA of the film. I was looking to work with Rishi sir for the longest time and I am glad this script clicked well,” Trehan told PTI in an interview.
The producer said he was amazed by the actor’s professionalism.
“He was so child-like, he was like a newcomer. He was so charged up. At the age of 67, he would shoot for 10-12 hours a day. There was no negative thought ever. There was no mention about his illness.
“And if you would ask him, ‘How are you feeling?’ He would say, ‘How am I looking?’ His attitude was commendable.”
Asked if the shooting schedule was changed due to his health, Trehan said, “He never allowed it.”
Trehan recalled that the Delhi schedule of the film was to start from mid-January this year and Kapoor was to arrive a day before and the actor’s sister Ritu Nanda had passed away the same day.

“It was a tragedy in the family and he happened to be in Delhi. We were planning to reschedule the shoot as per his convenience and he said, ‘No. The one thing I have learnt from my father is the show must go on’.
“He knew it would have been very difficult for the unit to shift any scene or sequence because he is there in every scene. He didn’t want us to put in an uncomfortable situation and he rather put himself into an uncomfortable situation.”
After roping in Kapoor, Trehan said, they approached Juhi Chawla, who too was eager about working on the film.
Chawla is among the few actors with whom Kapoor extensively worked in the 1990s. The two starred in movies such as “Bol Radha Bol”, “Eena Meena Deeka”, “Daraar” and “Luck By Chance”.
“To see them on screen together was so nostalgic for all of us,” the producer said.
Trehan added that the team shot for the film till mid-February and when lockdown was announced on March 24 they had to put their plans on hold.
“The film went on floors in December in Mumbai then we moved to Delhi and the last schedule was planned in Mumbai. But then COVID-19 warnings came and we were planning how to go ahead. We decided to wait and shoot once the lockdown lifted.”
The filmmaker said a few days of shooting was left on the film with Kapoor.
“Sadly this is his last project and we are sure we will finish it somehow soon. We will bring it out to his fans. Once things settle down, we will sit with our team and decide what to do,” he added.
Trehan said though the makers were yet to zero in on a release date, the film will hit the theatres this year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Couple marry in their garden with dogs as bridesmaids after wedding cancelled</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Autumn Wood and Christian Miller’s wedding was cancelled because of coronavirus, they decided to get married anyway.
They held a ceremony in their back garden and as they couldn’t have any guests, their dogs acted as bridesmaids.
The rest of their friend and family watched on Facebook Live as they wore face masks and drank Corona beer in a nod to the current situation.
After months of planning the perfect day, the engaged pair were devastated when lockdown caused their wedding on on May 23 to be cancelled.
Instead, Autumn and Christian, both 28, were married by his brother, who is isolating with them, at their home in Cincinnati, Ohio.
Autumn’s mum Cindi and Christian’s parents Tom and Barb were also present from a social distance as the couple got married on April 20 – the anniversary of the day they met.
Newlywed Autumn, an IT supervisor, said: ‘I had already gathered a lot of decorations and with our anniversary coming up, we just didn’t want to wait to be married any longer.
‘Christian, his parents and I spent the day transforming the backyard with things we had planned to use in May and we sent out a notice on Facebook for our families to join the livestream so they could watch our ceremony.
‘Our dogs Sasha and Oreo were my stand in bridesmaids and although they were very good and didn’t bark at all, they totally stole the show!
‘My new brother in law Ben married us and then cooked us all an incredible steak dinner followed by a delicious carrot cheesecake made by my mother in law Barb.’
After the ceremony, they sat by the fire and listened to their wedding playlist for the rest of the night.
Autumn added: ‘It was perfect – it wasn’t what I planned and it didn’t go the way I had been planning for months but I wouldn’t trade it.
‘I felt beautiful, it was all about me and the love of my life and I think looking back it’s going to be a wonderful story and moment for us.
‘I think our friends and family needed a break from the chaos and for a moment, we gave them that peace. I’ll cherish that forever.’
The couple have also rescheduled their honeymoon to Disneyland, planned for August.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Couple who were due to get married yesterday reveal their friends surprised them with an impromptu celebration on the street outside their flat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A bride-to-be has revealed her joy after her friends visited her home to congratulate her and her fiancé on what would have been their wedding day. 
James Dunn and Rachel Harrison, both 32, from London, have been together for 14-years and were due to get married yesterday at Higher Eggbeer Farm in Devon. 
They were forced to put their plans on hold after lock-down was announced - but that didn't stop friends Emmert Roberts, Constant Allarcon and Flabbie De Langautier from stopping by and congratulating them. 
Rachel, a wedding planner, told FEMAIL how their 'spirits were lifted' after seeing their pals, and said they also received video messages from their friends and family around the world. 
The couple's original wedding was set to have 150 people, and Rachel had been planning the day for around 18-months.
She explained that the couple had planned for a full wedding weekend for guests, saying: 'We booked a place in Devon to have for the whole weekend.
'Family staying in the house, people able to camp and today would have been the party, a bit of a BBQ.'
The couple were set to tie the knot at 2pm and Rachel explained that she was left in tears after her head bridesmaid arranged for her friends and family to send video messages that afternoon.
She explained: 'One of my best friends and my chief bridesmaids live in New Zealand, she was meant to be coming to the wedding and arranged for all of our friends and families to send us videos.' 
'So when two o'clock came round, we had this bombardment of videos of people toasting, which was really sweet and I was already in tears. So it was quite emotional.' 
She said: 'We've been really lucky, lots of our friends have sent deliveries and messages.'
However Rachel said the couple were particularly amazed when they received a text from some friends to say they were outside their window. 
Emmert, Constant and Flabbie decided to surprise their friends, donning party hats and elaborate masks to get into the party spirit.
The brightly coloured face masks were decorated with shoes, London buses and cupcakes to make sure they weren't spreading the virus. 
The group, who are isolating together, all wore jeans and trainers, but decided to add some flare to their outfits with a bow ties - with Flabbie even donning a borrowed top hat for the occasion. 
Rachel revealed: 'We felt very loved and our spirits were lifted of seeing human faces that weren't through a screen.'   
Rachel, who founded wedding planning business The Capston Second in 2015, hung out the window to chat with her pals while James stood in the doorway drinking a small bottle of champagne.  
The wedding planner went on to explain that while they were sad their big day was cancelled, having been together for so long the couple were happy to wait a little longer to tie the knot.
She said: 'I'm a wedding planner but I didn't manage to plan for a pandemic, we've been together for 14-years so we can wait another one.'
But she added: 'The mains stress was re-organising everything and it was upsetting then and now we've sorted everything that's a weight off. 
'We've just all been living in a parallel universe so the thought of having our wedding wasn't really anything. Everything changed so quickly. '

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sheridan Smith and baby bump make lockdown TV debut as Mel in Isolation Stories</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sheridan Smith is to appear in the first episode of an emotional new television series called Isolation Stories.
The actress, 38, is just weeks away from giving birth and will show off her blossoming belly when she stars as heavily pregnant character Mel.
The new ITV series begins on May 4 and will document the experiences that families face during the coronavirus lockdown in 15-minute episodes throughout the week.
On Monday, Sheridan becomes Mel, an expectant single mother that is isolating alone during the lockdown.
In the emotional scenes, the downcast character speaks to her friends via video call but in fact doesn't mind being in isolation.
During the convincing and tearful performance, the character struggles to come to term with her baby's imminent birth as well as going through the pregnancy without the married father of her child.
In a snippet ahead of Monday's show, Sheridan is featured in different rooms of her home while exchanging virtual moments with pals.
In one scene, Mel struggled to cast a smile as a friend is heard saying: "Melanie, let's see the bump."
Another scene later in the short episode featured the character sobbing on the phone as she heard the words: "You're going to be a lovely mum."
According to the Sheridan, she had had jumped at the opportunity to be involved with the miniseries because she felt it was important to reflect on what is going on.
"I am heavily pregnant and have been isolating at home," she said.
"So I jumped at the chance to make a drama about the massive drama going on all around us right now.
The entire series has also been recorded in line with the country's strict isolation guidelines.
During the filming of the show, produced by Oscar nominee Jeff Pope, directors would remotely instruct the actors on camera angles and scene composition.
As well as Sheridan Smith, actor Robert Glenister, Eddie Marsan and Angela Griffin will also star in episodes during the week.
Isolation Storiesairs at 9pm over four nights on ITV from tomorrow.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pregnant Sheridan Smith weeps and cradles her baby bump in an emotional new trailer for ITV's hardhitting drama Isolation Stories inspired by the coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A heavily pregnant Sheridan Smith weeps and cradles her baby bump in an emotional new trailer for hardhitting ITV drama Isolation Stories.  
The actress, 38, takes a starring role in Isolation Stories, a collection of four brand new stand-alone episodes born out of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, which has so far claimed 227,638 lives across the world.
Sheridan - who is expecting her first child with Jamie Horn - stars in the first of the four 15-minute episodes from BAFTA-winning executive producer Jeff Pope, which tells the stories of four different families, inspired by true people, coping through the crisis.
In a new trailer for the drama, Sheridan, who plays Mel in the TV short, can be seen weeping as she video-calls family and discussing her upcoming motherhood. 
In the trailer for the drama, which starts tomorrow night, Sheridan's character Mel can be seen video calling loved-ones from her home.
Upon asking how many people are staying together, she is gutted to learn that there are 11 people isolating together, while she remains alone.
Emotionally, she says: 'You've got 11 people there and you didn't even ask me.'
And later, she is seen crying while speaking on the phone with someone about motherhood. 
Director Jeff previously told how viewers will find her episode very emotional as the actress reveals her baby bump on camera for the first time. 
He said: 'She had an enormous bump which makes an appearance at the end of the… She unveils this amazing… Then you see it – then she pulls it up, and it's a very emotional moment at the end.'
Of Sheridan's decision to take the role while heavily pregnant herself, he added: 'She's in very good health. She's not got pre-eclampsia or any of those conditions that would be dangerous.' 
Reflecting on the shoot, which took place in the home she shares with her insurance broker fiancé, Sheridan admitted it was left to him to set up the production equipment and handle the cameras while she filmed her scenes. 
She explained: 'They dropped off lots of camera, lighting and sound equipment at the gate, all disinfected. Jamie was then talked through how it all worked.
'We had a crew of people on Zoom with us at all times during filming, explaining to Jamie where to place the cameras and lighting, he was amazing and isn’t in the industry so I was so proud of him. 
'He was so good and turned out to be a natural cameraman. They were so impressed that they trusted him to do camera shots that are even tricky with a whole crew. 
'I couldn’t help much with lifting, currently being so pregnant myself, so I was in charge of costume, make up, continuity etc.' 
The actress admits she immediately said yes to the project after an initial approach from Oscar nominated writer and producer Pope, who laid the foundations for the series after watching wife Tina struggle with coronavirus symptoms. 
She said: 'I am heavily pregnant and have been isolating at home so I jumped at the chance to make a drama about the massive drama going on all around us right now. 
'I think it's really important to try and reflect what's happening to us whilst it is still.' 
Six weeks of government mandated lockdown has also made Sheridan acutely aware of her good fortune in having Jamie, while character Mel faces an uncertain future without the father of her child, and without her family - who have abandoned her. 
'I’m lucky I have the baby coming soon so it’s been a focus for me,' she said. 'I think it would be hard for people like the character I play in the drama, as she is on her own. And obviously it’s hard for all the families being kept apart at the minute, so I count myself lucky and we have adapted to this new “normal” for now. 
'Clapping for the carers and watching all the beautiful situations happening have put things into perspective. It’s a terribly sad time for so many. 
'But people coming together encouraging each other to stay strong has been a wonderful thing to witness.' 
Robert and Tom Glenister, Eddie Marsan, Angela Griffin, Darren Boyd, David Threlfall, Michael Jibson, Leanne Best and Philip Jackson will also feature in the new four-part series. 
Isolation Stories will air at 9pm for four consecutive nights on ITV1 from Monday May 4th.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meghan & Harry Will Reportedly Spill Some Royal Tea In A Tell-All Biography</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Could Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex soon spill some royal tea? Meghan and Harry reportedly granted an interview for an upcoming tell-all biography titled Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making Of A Modern Royal Family. According to a Deadline report published on May 3, Finding Freedom authors Omid Scobie, royal editor for Harper's Bazaar, and Carolyn Durand, royal contributor for Elle and O, The Oprah Magazine, reportedly interviewed Meghan and Harry prior to their move from the UK to Canada (and later, Los Angeles). Bustle has reached out to Meghan and Harry's rep for comment.
Finding Freedom, available on August 11, will go “beyond the headlines” and chronicle “unknown details” about Meghan and Harry’s life together, as well as dispel the “rumors and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond,” per the biography’s blurb on Amazon. With Scobie and Durand’s “unique access” and the “participation of those closest to the couple,” the biography promises an intimate portrait of the “confident, influential, and forward-thinking couple who are unafraid to break with tradition” and “determined to create a new path away from the spotlight.”
The reported interview will be one of the first since Meghan and Harry officially stepped down as senior members of the royal family in March. Since their relocation to Los Angeles with son Archie that same month, the two have been spotted out and about delivering groceries to families in need with charity Project Angel Food during the global health crisis, surgical masks and gloves in tow.
The tell-all would mark Meghan’s second project post-royal split. The duchess last narrated the Disney+ nature documentary Elephant, which follows a herd of resilient African elephants as they journey across the Kalahari Desert. In partnership with Elephants Without Borders, Disney donated Meghan's voiceover fees to the charity dedicated to wildlife conservation in Botswana.
“She was absolutely intrigued by the elephants, and transfixed, especially by the female empowerment side,” co-director Vanessa Berlowitz told PEOPLE of Meghan’s involvement in April. “How important the matriarchs are to the story; it really is all about female leadership. It’s a different form of power. She was absolutely fascinated by that.”
Since Elephant’s release, Meghan has also popped up in Zoom calls to chat with members of the UK’s Hubb Community Kitchen and to surprise a Smarts Work client before a job interview. As for what could be next for the Harry and Meghan, perhaps Finding Freedom will provide some insights.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Revealed: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's bombshell biography is called 'Finding Freedom' and promises an 'up-close portrait' of the 'confident' couple</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The name of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's bombshell biography has been revealed as Finding Freedom.
Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of A Modern Royal Family is set to be released worldwide online on August 11, with the hard copy on sale from August 20.
A description of the biography on Amazon promises to offer an 'honest, up-close, and disarming portrait' of the 'confident, influential, forward' Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan Markle, 38.
Last month, the Mail on Sunday reported that the Duke and Duchess had co-operated with Omid Scobie and Catherine Durand on the explosive new book that risks inflicting further anguish on the royal family.
Publishing house Harper Collins, which owns Dey Street Books, the publisher of the biography released a brief description of Meghan and Prince Harry's collaboration with the two journalists.
The book's description says that 'few know the true story of Harry and Meghan'. 
It promises to go 'beyond the headlines to reveal unknown details of Harry and Meghan's life together, dispelling the many rumours and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond'.
It continues: 'With unique access and written with the participation of those closest to the couple, Finding Freedom is an honest, up-close, and disarming portrait of a confident, influential, and forward-thinking couple who are unafraid to break with tradition, determined to create a new path away from the spotlight, and dedicated to building a humanitarian legacy that will make a profound difference in the world.'
Meanwhile the cover features a beaming Prince Harry and Meghan as they visited their namesake county in October 2018 for the first time.
Palace insiders expect the biography to paint a flattering portrait of the couple. 
There are fears it will also be a score-settling exercise in which Harry and Meghan's strained relationship with the Royal Family and painful decision to quit Britain are revisited in uncomfortable detail.
The Mail on Sunday were told that before moving to North America, the privacy-obsessed Sussexes gave an interview to the book's authors, both journalists. 
One of them, Omid Scobie,is an acknowledged Meghan cheerleader and was one of the favoured journalists given details of the couple's video call to the Queen last week in which they wished her a happy 94th birthday. 
Echoing Princess Diana's secret involvement in the blockbuster biography, Diana: Her True Story, when she encouraged her friends to speak to author Andrew Morton, questions are being asked whether members of Meghan's inner circle were being urged to help Scobie and his American co-author, Carolyn Durand. 
The 320-page biography, due to be released in August, is expected to be a global bestseller.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr ‘unheard’ track going under the hammer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An unheard track by Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Ringo Starr recorded after the Beatles split is heading for auction.
Angel In Disguise could be the only song co-written exclusively by the band’s former bassist and drummer, according to auctioneers.
The ex-Beatles recorded the demo for Sir Ringo’s 1992 solo album Time Takes Time but it did not make the cut.
Former Radio Luxembourg DJ Tony Prince is selling the cassette, which is expected to fetch up to £20,000.
He was asked to find artists to record alternative versions of Angel In Disguise in the 1990s, after Sir Ringo rejected the track.
The song has never been heard publicly.
Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said: “It’s fantastic to be able to bring to the market a previously unheard and unreleased track…
“We think the track certainly had enough about it to be included in the album and I am sure if Paul was to release this himself it would certainly prove a hit with fans.”
The cassette contains two versions of the track – a rough demo with Sir Paul  on vocals and a fuller ‘mixed’ version with musicians and backing vocals and Sir Ringo singing.
Another Sir Ringo demo, Everyone Wins, which was also shelved but later released on a compilation recording, is also included on the tape.
The tape, with other memorabilia, will go under the hammer at Omega Auctions’ online sale on May 19, with 25% of proceeds donated to the NHS Charities Together Covid-19 Urgent Appeal.

The Beatles announced their split in 1970, shortly before the release of their twelfth studio album, Let It Be.
Speaking on SiriusXM's The Howard Stern Show in March, Sir Paul spoke candidly about the end of the world's most successful group. 
When asked why he didn't keep the band together after Lennon announced his departure, he said:  'When families break up, it's to do with the emotion and the emotional pain.
'You can't just think of a smart idea like that at the time. You're hurting too much so it wasn't going to happen.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby's final Celebrity Juice episode already filmed as she quits show</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Keith Lemon has confirmed that Holly Willoughby's final episode of Celebrity Juice has already been filmed.
Holly announced she had quit the ITV2 series after 12 years on Sunday, leaving viewers gutted.
She follows former co-stars Fearne Cotton and Rufus Hound who have also left in recent years, while Keith is the only original cast member remaining.
Keith took to social media to say goodbye to his close friend after her decision was made public.
He wrote: "I’ve had a lovely time working with you. You are the best! I hope I’m lucky enough to work with you again one day. Goodbye @hollywills x."
Now, he appears to have confirmed that Holly's final Celebrity Juice has been filmed.
The show has been recorded differently this series due to the coronavirus lockdown, and studio filmed episodes halting in March.
The team including new panellist Mel B all returned and filmed the show from their homes to meet social distancing rules, and the last episodes of the series are filmed in the same way.
As fans took to Twitter to share their sadness, many asked Keith about whether there would be a goodbye show for Holly.
One viewer told him directly: "Keith we need a goodbye show..best bits...cakie..ect ect ect..x."
Keith replied, confirming it was already filmed - while later tweeting to another fan that there weren't many episodes left in the current series.
He said: "Filmed it already. Shame it was whilst lockdown was happening. No hugs."
Keith later tweeted: "One more juice next week then a comp show then that’s it."
While many viewers fear this is the end of the show, Keith appeared to suggest otherwise as he continued to tweet as though the show will go on without Holly - amid speculation Michelle Keegan may replace her.
Keith was also forced to remind people Holly was quitting the show and not TV in general, while Holly herself revealed she would return for appearances on the series.
He said: "Don’t worry you’ll get more Holly. She isn’t stopping telly Just not on celeb juice anymore. Sad times."
Meanwhile, Holly revealed: "I'll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check... if I don’t see you through a week or next week or the week after... know you are always in my heart."
Celebrity Juice continues on Thursday at 10pm on ITV2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Keith Lemon breaks silence as Holly Willoughby quits Celebrity Juice</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Keith Lemon has broken his silence following the news that Holly Willoughby has quit Celebrity Juice after 12 years.
The comedian paid tribute to his former team captain shortly after she confirmed that was stepping down from the ITV panel show in a lengthy statement, and shared a heartfelt video of all their best bits and photographs together.
Alongside the clip, Keith wrote: ‘Goodbye @hollywilloughby.
‘I’ve had a lovely time working with you. You are the best! I hope I’m lucky enough to work with you again one day.
‘If I don’t see ya through the week I’ll see ya through the window. Big hugs KL x’
Holly announced her departure from the series hours after rumours had circulated that she had quit.
‘Thank you Celebrity Juice for 12 years of fantastic chaos… I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone,’ she penned.
‘ Thank you to you all for watching..we’ve always had the loudest and best audiences.
‘Also a huge thank you to ITV2 for believing in the show in the first place and for all of your support…Over the years the production team has changed, however to anyone lucky enough to have worked on the show, they will know that we really do have the best time, it’s never felt like work and always been to me like a night out..’
Holly went on to add: ‘Thank you for making me laugh for twelve years… I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check… if I don’t see you through a week or next week or the week after… know you are always in my heart..’
It’s not yet been confirmed who will be replacing Holly on the show, but Our Girl star Michelle Keegan is currently the bookies favourite.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson can't help but poke fun at his friend.
On Saturday, Johnson was awarded favorite movie actor at the Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Awards, and in his acceptance speech, he playfully jabbed his good pal Kevin Hart, joking about his height.

"Hey, kids all around the world, I want to say thank you so much from the bottom of my heart for voting for me. And I also want to thank and commend the Kids' Choice Awards for using this broadcast to raise really critical awareness for child hunger," said Johnson, 48, over a video chat, per E! News. "So, well done to you guys."
The actor then brought up his "Jumanji: The Next Level" co-star.
"I want you to stay positive; I want you to stay happy; I want you to stay healthy; I want you to go to bed tonight feeling great," Johnson joked. "Because however old you are, around the world, just know that you are still bigger than Kevin Hart."

Johnson added: "I love you guys."
The actor bagged the award for his work in both "Jumanji" and "Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw."
John teased future appearances of his character from the films, telling fans they'll "see more Hobbs [from 'Fast & Furious] and more Dr. Smolder Bravestone [from 'Jumanji'] coming soon."

The awards broadcast also served as an event to raise awareness of child hunger, as Johnson mentioned.  Nickelodeon also donated $1 million to the No Kid Hungry charity.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LeBron James is one of a kind!
The NBA star and Los Angeles Laker was honored with the 2020 Generation Change Award during Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice Awards 2020: Celebrate Together on Saturday. James virtually greeted all the fans and viewers as he received the award, which celebrated his commitment to creating real and lasting change through education.
"Hey, what's up, guys? I just wanna say thank you. It means a lot to not only myself, but to my family, to my fans and also my kids at my school back home in Akron, Ohio," James said via video. "And we'll get back to what we know as normal very soon."
The LeBron James Family Foundation’s groundbreaking I PROMISE School serves James' Akron, Ohio, hometown’s most at-risk students and their entire families with the support, programming and wide-ranging resources they need to succeed in the classroom and at home, creating a new model for urban, public education.
LeBron, additionally, also won the award for Kids' Choice Favorite Male Athlete.
"Wow. Just wanna say thank you. You guys are amazing," he also added. "Nickelodeon, you guys are amazing. Thanks so much for what you guys do for every kid in the world.This has always been one of the best shows to be a part of. So thank you so much. I'll hopefully be seeing you guys soon. Stay safe and stay healthy. Love you guys."
Nickelodeon's annual awards show was one of the first major events postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, the network put together a virtual special hosted by Victoria Justice.
Additionally, Nickelodeon supported the mission of No Kid Hungry, a national campaign to end childhood hunger in America, and presented within the show a $1 million donation in support of those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Stars reunited virtually from their homes to celebrate the annual awards ceremony. See more from this year's unique show, below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Emerging culture critics announced for the Herald and The Age</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age have selected five emerging culture critics after receiving funding from the Copyright Agency and the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas.
The grant will enable up to 100 extra pieces of critical writing across literature, visual arts and theatre in 2020.
The books critics are Bec Kavanagh and Jack Callil, who will write for both mastheads. The visual arts critics are Chloe Wolifson (Sydney) and Tiarney Miekus (Melbourne), while Cassie Tongue will cover theatre for the Herald.
While the present coronavirus-induced shutdown has decimated much of the arts and culture industry and forced theatres and art galleries to close, it provides the writers with an opportunity to produce other critical pieces and highlight areas of innovation during this once-in-a-generation crisis.
Kavanagh is a Melbourne-based writer who has been published in The Australian and Meanjin.
"I'm looking forward to sinking my teeth into some great new stories, and writing into a space that values the contributions of writers and the arts – particularly at this time," she said.
Callil is digital editor at the Australian Book Review and a proofreader at Meanjin.
"Having the opportunity to write about Australia’s vibrant and diverse literary community is an exceptional privilege," he said.
Wolifson has previously written for the Herald and The Guardian and has a monthly column in Art Monthly Australasia.
"It's always my hope that a review I've written encourages readers to go and view the exhibition themselves and engage with the work. I'm excited for this opportunity to start more conversations about Australian contemporary art," she said.
Miekus is a Melbourne-based writer and editor of Art Guide Australia. She has a strong interest in contemporary art and plays in a post-punk band.
"It's both humbling and exciting to be a contributing voice on visual arts, and to have the space, time and support to think intently and purposefully on visual art," she said.
Tongue has had regular theatre reviews published in Time Out and The Guardian.
"I'm looking forward to writing about new Australian performance as it happens: exploring new trends, engaging deeply with what our artists have to say, and giving thoughtful responses to the work of theatre-makers and performers who might otherwise miss out on coverage," she said.
Copyright Agency chief executive Adam Suckling said the five new critics will bring "important new voices to the landscape of arts criticism and review in Australia".
"The current crisis has shown just how fragile and important Australian writing and visual arts practice is," Mr Suckling said.
"While things are very grim for creators at the moment, the new critics will look at ways of covering Australian creativity during this terrible crisis. But they will also be in place for when, and I hope this is very soon, it is safe for Australian audiences to return to physical book launches, plays and shows at galleries."
Matthew Burgess, culture editor at the Herald and The Age, said he was "thrilled" to welcome the five new critics to the mastheads after an impressive number of applications.
"It is an exciting opportunity for our readers to gain fresh perspectives in visual arts, stage and books criticism," he said. "Our thanks to the Copyright Agency and the Judith Neilson Institute for supporting this important project."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Madonna made sure she didn't miss out on a friend's birthday party, despite recently testing positive for coronavirus antibodies.
The Like A Virgin singer, 61, attended the bash in person and even hugged and presented her pal Steven Klein with a cake to mark his 55th birthday.
No one at the birthday bash was wearing any protective gear like face masks, despite the worldwide coronavirus crisis.
Madonna's positive test means she has recently been in contact with Covid-19.
Klein's birthday party was livestreamed on the video chatting app Zoom meaning guests could attend it virtually, but defiant Madge was there in person.
One of the people who attended shared a video of Madonna hugging Klein.
They captioned the post: "M made an appearance at Steven Klein's Virtual Birthday Party - such a blast!!
"M called his Bday cake a Covid Cake.
"She's too f**king cute!!! We are living in some crazy tiMes!
"But trying to make the most of it, and still have soMe fun!!! [sic]"
Mirror Online has contacted Madonna's reps for comment.
Madonna took to Instagram to reveal she'd tested positive for the coronavirus antibodies earlier this week.
"Took a test the other day, and I found out that I have the antibodies," she said.
"So tomorrow, I'm just going to go for a long drive in the car… and I'm going to breathe in the COVID-19 air.
"Yep. I hope the sun is shining."

"I've known this woman since she started in the industry," Halle wrote, "And it's been such a joy to watch her flourish and succeed.
"Obsessed with this line, check my stories for a few of my favourites!"
The Hollywood icon recently reminisced about her time in the industry, including her work on Die Another Day, Pierce Brosnan's last Bond film before he hung up the mantle.
Halle recalled that the Irish actor, now 66, had to give her the Heimlich Manoeuvre as she choked on a fig during a steamy sex scene.
Chatting with American talk show host Jimmy Fallon from her home, she dished: "I was supposed to be all sexy, trying to seduce him with a fig, and then I ended up choking on it and he had to get up and do the Heimlich.
"James Bond knows how to Heimlich!
"He was there for me, he will always be one of my favourite people in the world."
She was playing love interest and fellow spy Jinx, revealing that the studio had even flirted with the idea of giving her character her own spinoff flick.
She's also been battling online trolls since going into lockdown, clapping back at those who passed judgement on her for letting six year old Maceo-Robert wear high heels.
"Is this your daughter or your son?" one wrote.
She came back: "Well it's a he and he is having a ball. Tryna cope the best he can! Laughter helps a lot right now."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Chase fans in disbelief over contestant's likeness to Emmerdale legend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Viewers tuning into The Chase's family special on Sunday, called The Family Chase, were left stunned by one contestant.
Those watching the ITV gameshow dubbed her a lookalike of a former Emmerdale legend.
Viewers thought contestant Paula looked so much like the character in particular, that they began calling her by said character's name.
Emmerdale fans were quick to spot she looked remarkably like Val Pollard.
Val was married to Eric Pollard in the Dales, before her tragic death in 2015 during the helicopter stunt.
She was played by actress Charlie Hardwick since 2004.
As Paula appeared on The Chase on Sunday, fans spotted the huge resemblance between her and the actress who played Val.
From the hair colour to the matching style, and even the Geordie accent, fans couldn't believe their eyes.
One viewer said: "Seat 2  #TheChase," with an image of Val leading to many others agreeing.
Another fan agreed: "Val up now! #TheChase."
A third said: "Now it's Val from Emmerdale  #Thefamilychase."
Unfortunately, like her sister who went before her, Paula was caught by the Chaser, Paul Sinha, and sent home.
As her departure aired, one fan tweeted: "That was too f***ing easy. Now do one back to the Woolpack, Val."
A second fan hoped she might return for the final chase, and said: "Go low & bring Val back oot!"
Unfortunately, it was just Hannah left to play in the final round and she and the family did not win the cash prize.
The Chase airs weeknights at 5pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Who will take Holly Willoughby's spot on Celebrity Juice?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Now that Holly Willoughby had opted to leave Celebrity Juice, the show needs a new team captain.
With no official word on who will fill Holly's shoes, fans are busy speculating as to who will be baring the brunt of Keith Lemon's most outrageous gags.
Holly did just that for 12 years, having been a team captain since the show got off the ground way back in 2008 - but who will take her place?
The biggest theories are below...
The Corrie and Our Girl star is probably the front runner right now.
Both Michelle and hunky husband Mark Wright have made appearances on the show, and both were a hit with fans.
Bookies Ladbrokes are backing her too, a spokesman saying: "Michelle Keegan's no stranger to Celebrity Juice and she could soon become a permanent fixture if the latest odds are anything to go by."
She's also hung up her helmet on Our Girl, so she could have some space open in her diary...
Gogglebox original Scarlett Moffatt has also been floated by fans.
She's also appeared on the show, and proved a popular panellist.
Ladbrokes reckon she's a solid bet, and fans know from Gogglebox she's got the comedy chops to stand her own ground.
Inbetweeners star Emily went through a surge in popularity after her I'm A Celebrity stint in 2018.
She's since become an ITV staple, with This Morning appearances and a hosting gig on I'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp.
Emily's appeared fairly recently on Celebrity Juice, and sent Keith into overdrive by sharing a kiss with Spice Girl Mel B.
Kelly and Keith must be close mates by now - she's turned up on the show, and even starred in his film, aptly named Keith Lemon: The Movie.
She's already got her radio show so her diary's pretty busy, but if her recent Bake Off stint proved anything it's that she can keep fans entertained.
Her rapport with pal Keith is already well established in fans' minds, so she won't take much introduction.
The Italian chef is another ITV staple, and no stranger to speaking his mind.
During his This Morning appearances, when he cooks with Holly and Phillip Schofield, he's become legendary for his brutal honesty and scathing criticism.
He's been busy with Gordon Ramsay and Fred Sirieix on their show Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip, so it's uncertain how much freedom he'll have.
He'd certainly clash with Keith...

    <h5 class="mb-1">Who will take Holly Willoughby's spot on Celebrity Juice?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Now that Holly Willoughby had opted to leave Celebrity Juice, the show needs a new team captain.
With no official word on who will fill Holly's shoes, fans are busy speculating as to who will be baring the brunt of Keith Lemon's most outrageous gags.
Holly did just that for 12 years, having been a team captain since the show got off the ground way back in 2008 - but who will take her place?
The biggest theories are below...
The Corrie and Our Girl star is probably the front runner right now.
Both Michelle and hunky husband Mark Wright have made appearances on the show, and both were a hit with fans.
Bookies Ladbrokes are backing her too, a spokesman saying: "Michelle Keegan's no stranger to Celebrity Juice and she could soon become a permanent fixture if the latest odds are anything to go by."
She's also hung up her helmet on Our Girl, so she could have some space open in her diary...
Gogglebox original Scarlett Moffatt has also been floated by fans.
She's also appeared on the show, and proved a popular panellist.
Ladbrokes reckon she's a solid bet, and fans know from Gogglebox she's got the comedy chops to stand her own ground.
Inbetweeners star Emily went through a surge in popularity after her I'm A Celebrity stint in 2018.
She's since become an ITV staple, with This Morning appearances and a hosting gig on I'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gogglebox viewers rank the stars with one group taking nearly 40% of the vote</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gogglebox has become beloved by millions, and everyone has their favourites.
Fans recently took part in a poll that allowed them to put forward which of the 11 groups they reckoned deserved the honour of the top spot.
The poll, conducted by The Liverpool Echo, asked fans to order the stars based on how much they make them laugh - with one even stealing 39% of the vote.
Below are all 11 groups, ranked...
London family the Vens joined the show quite late, during season 11 in 2018.
Marcus, girlfriend Mica, and her two daughters Sachelle and Shuggy have become renowned for their bubbly personalities, fits of laughter, and on point honesty.
Mica provided a priceless fan favourite moment as they sat down to watch Victoria Coren Mitchell's notoriously tricky Only Connect, laughing: "This show isn't for the hood, man."
Dad Andrew, mum Carolyne and son Louis have been Gogglebox fixtures since the show first kicked off.
Their numbers have fluctuated, as twin sisters Alex and Catheryne seem to come and go as well.
The family have become best known for Andrew's uncompromising and often scathing wit, as he kicks back in that enormous armchair.
Brighton hairdresser Stephen first appeared on the show alongside then boyfriend Chris, before the pair went their separate ways.
He's since been joined by husband Daniel, as well as mum Pat for a stint.
Stephen is responsible for one of the most iconic Gogglebox moments.
As he and Chris watched the news, the latter observed: "We all like a bad boy, don't we?"
A stunned Stephen looks around and answers: "Not a f**king terrorist though, Chris!"
Dave and Shirley have been married for a staggering 40 years, filming the show from their home in Wales.
Joining the show in 2015, fans have learned that the pair have a genuine deep love for each other - but that won't stop them having a bicker now and again.
Ellie and Izzi stirred the pot recently when they made their feelings very clear about Boris Johnson.
Still, the Yorkshire sisters are mostly a light hearted pair, most often obsessing over food.
When they first put their names down for the show, they reckoned people wouldn't be interested in what they had to say.
The poll begs to differ...
Bristol besties Mary and Marina are completely unfiltered and they hold nothing back.
Both in their 80s, they film from a retirement home and have won legions of fans as their conversations go off on tangents.
Dad Sid and sons Baasit and Umar are well known for their no nonsense slams and quick wit.
The core three are often joined by other family members, like sister Raza and their mum.
The family of four have carved out a place as firm fan favourites, as have their Rottweilers.
The dogs can be seen having a nose about the place and often trying to swipe a biscuit or two when they think the family won't notice.
In fact, their snack collection has become the stuff of Gogglebox legend, with fans not convinced they ever eat them themselves.
Probably the quirkiest couple on the list, Giles and Mary will always have a place in fans' hearts.
The posh duo's home is instantly memorable, as are their lengthy and eloquent rants about whatever they're watching.
Coming in second place with 23% of the vote, brother and sister Pete and Sophie were string contenders for the top spot despite only arriving on the show in 2018.
The Blackpool pair have become renowned for mocking each other as much as they do the telly, so it's no surprise they've proved a hit with fans.
Taking the top spot are the iconic, the legendary, the one and only Jenny and Lee.
The caravan-based pair from Hull swept up a whopping 39% of the vote, landing them as the firm victors.
They first met when Jenny was a landlady and Lee was a pub regular, and have since struck up the sweetest - and funniest friendship.
Joining in 2014, it's not difficult to see why they've managed to place themselves at the top of the list.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mystery over Rob Kardashian and stunning British influencer Kenza Boutrif's new friendship</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rob Kardashian has just added stunning British model and influencer Kenza Boutrif to his Instagram following, taking the total up to 21.
The 33-year-old reality star set tongues wagging on social media after giving the UK-based model and social media star a follow over the weekend.
Rob's tiny following is usually reserved for his closest family and friends, such as his sisters Kourtney, Khloe and Kim Kardashian.
The reality star's unusual move came less than a week after he made a rare appearance on Keeping Up With The Kardashians to celebrate his daughter's birthday.
But what do we know about Rob's new social media friend?
Kenza Boutrif is a glamorous social media model that is represented by Wilhelmina Models.
She boasts an impressive following of 634,000 fans on Instagram and only follows 103 back - including Rob.
The well-travelled influencer boasts pictures taken in Dubai, New York and Los Angeles among her incredible collection of jet setting snaps and she was also at London Fashion Week earlier this year.
Among her stellar collection of pictures, she has also received plenty of approval from other popular UK reality stars.
Some of her pictures have been liked by Love Island stars Belle Hassan and Yewande Biala.
Kenza also has her own Depop page where she is selling plenty of designer goods such as Comme Des Garcons and a pair of Alexander McQueen trainers.
In the meantime, Rob is currently embroiled in a bitter fued with his ex-girlfriend and model Blac Chynna.
The former couple dated back in 2016 and their daughter was born just one month before their split was made official.
Since then, the volatile couple have been caught up in an ongoing and complicated custody battle over their Dream.
At the end of February 2020, a judge denied Rob's request to have primary custody over his daughter.
Both Rob and Kenza have been contacted for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronation Street’s Peter Barlow will save Yasmeen from jail and expose Geoff’s lies say fans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CORRIE fans think Peter Barlow will save Yasmeen Nazir from prison after he notices she’s been showing some worrying behaviour.
It’s been a rollercoaster week on the cobbles as viewers have been left horrified by the abuse Yasmeen has experienced at the hands of her husband Geoff Metcalfe.
Fans watched from behind their cushions as Yasmeen finally snapped after months of terrifying abuse and stabbed Geoff in the neck with a broken wine bottle.
In spoilers for the long-running soap, it’s been revealed Yasmeen, played by Shelley King, will call the police be charged with attempted murder as street residents are left in shock at the news of the attack.
But fans think Peter, played by Chris Gascoyne, will come to her rescue and tell police he’s witnessed several displays of worrying behaviour from her.
One wrote: “…If you look in the last few episodes we had Sally, Eileen and Peter notice something wasn’t right but didn’t act. So maybe these are the people who will stick by Yasmeen.”
And another added: “i really hope peter and eileen are going to be allies to yasmeen in the coming weeks bc they seem to be the only people to have suspicions about geoff”
While a third guessed: “Calling for Peter being Yasmeen’s rescue…”
Earlier in the episode fans were horrified as Yasmeen was dragged out to the pub in a red dress that charmless Geoff had originally bought for a sex worker.
Geoff, played by Ian Bartholomew, took her to the Rovers to see Sally and Tim – before dropping the bombshell that he'd handed over her money to pay for their wedding.
Yasmeen was shocked that he'd handed over a fortune without consulting her, but Geoff barked: "You want to do this now? Get your coat. Shift. Don't you dare turn the waterworks on in here."
As she walked away from the bar the cameras lingered on Peter looking at her with concern, giving fans hope that he will realise something isn't adding up after Yasmeen's arrest
Away from prying eyes at No.6 viewers watched in horror as Geoff grabbed a knife and told Yasmeen: "Maybe I should kill you – do the world a favour. Would anyone really notice if you were gone?"
With that, she picked up a wine bottle and smashed abusive Geoff around the head before plunging the broken glass into his neck.
Peter has been keeping an eye on Yasmeen ever since Geoff told everyone she had a drinking problem earlier this year.
Fans are on the edge of their seats as they wait to see what happens, admitting they were “sucked in” by the plot.
One wrote: “I love when #corrie does episodes like this. They are just so well put together and engaging. Proper sucked in by this storyline of poor Yasmeen and they're going a fantastic job of it.”
Another added: “Lets go Yasmeen Thinking face Take that Geoff f**ker out preferably with a bullet bloody hard to watch #Corrie”
And a third wrote: “It was very disturbing to watch but i am glad that Yasmeen has fought back. However she will not deserve to be sent to prison for this, i hope tim, sally , peter and her friends will understand what has been going on. Think Eileen does. No one shoud go through that. Awful man”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Spoilers: Corrie boss reveals all on Yasmeen and Geoff ending</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There have been some difficult decisions to be made throughout the long running storyline arc of Geoff Metcalfe’s (Ian Bartholomew) campaign of coercive abuse against Yasmeen Nazir (Shelley King), according to Coronation Street boss Iain Macleod – but one thing he insists is that the recent twist that saw the horrific husband left for dead was planned for the start.
Viewers saw Geoff become more aggressive than ever and leave Yasmeen in terror of her life as he ranted horrific abuse and waved a knife in her face, suggesting it would be better for everyone if he just killed her.
In a relexive move to defend herself, a petrified Yasmeen stabbed Geoff in the neck and will be seen phoning the police to reveal that she has killed her husband.
It has been a deliberately slow paced story – and one that producer Iain admits has been the most debated over in the storyline office out of any plot.
He told Radio Times: ‘It’s been refined month by month in conjunction with our charity and research partners (including Women’s Aid). We’ve known pretty much from the start this incident would be one of the major peaks.
‘It’s been organically told and we’ve agonised over the advancement of how Geoff’s behaviour evolved.
‘It has been discussed in more detail than any other story I’ve worked on, just to make sure we get the nuance right.’
The storyline has come up for almost universal praise, with many in Yasmeen’s position having commended the show for its accurate portrayal of coercive control.
Iain added: ‘We don’t make it for this reason but it is important to have what I call good ‘drama karma’: what you’re putting on screen is karmically making the world little bit of a better place. I really think this story is.’

Controversial self-styled investigative journalist, Kemi Olunloyo, joined other celebrities who took to social media to congratulate Davido’s fiancee, Chioma, as she marked her birthday Thursday.
However, Kemi, in her birthday message to Chioma, couldn’t resist shading the mother-of-one as she reminded her of the Porsche car she got from Davido as her birthday gift back in 2018.
Kemi Olunloyo also reminded her of the cooking show where she signed a deal for two years, and which is yet to officially kick-off.
According to her, the cooking show and Porsche car are all “audio”, as they were only heard about but not seen.
She wrote:  “Happy birthday Chioma. Audio cooking show nko? You announced two years ago today? 2018 Porsche nko? Have you gotten your driver’s license?”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Casualty episode scrapped by BBC over Covid-19 - but fans want missing episode</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans of medical drama Casualty want a missing episode made available on BBC iPlayer.
The episode was due to be shown this weekend but was scrapped by the BBC due to 'inappropriate' content during the current coronavirus pandemic.
An announcement before last night's instalment said: "The episode we were due to watch tonight, filmed before the spread of Covid-19, was considered inappropriate to show at the moment."
The episode that aired on Saturday night instead included a short catch-up that filled viewers in on scenes from the major storylines that they will have missed due to the transmission of the preceding instalment being skipped.
The announcer continued before it started: "But never fear. everything we need to know from that episode is in a catch up right at the start of the programme."
However, the short recap before this weekend's episode wasn't enough for some fans, who have now taken to social media calling for the BBC to make the missing instalment available on their catch-up service, BBC iPlayer.
One fan wrote on Twitter : "I assumed I’d missed one so checked iPlayer but no. Turns out the BBC decided to cut it!
"Please put it on iPlayer so I can decide whether to watch it!!"
Another disappointed viewer commented: "Can't they just put it on iplayer then? Gives people a choice on whether they want to watch or not! #casualty "
Elsewhere, a third Casualty fan commented: "That missing episode of #Casualty looks great. Bonkers decision not to show it.
"I understand the reasoning but I disagree with it."
Another Twitter user thought the missing episode could have helped give some viewers a realistic look at what we're all currently facing.
They tweeted: "Deemed inappropriate? Maybe show the episode and give people the reality check they need to keep them in the bloody house #casualty."
Finally, one Casualty viewer concluded: "Hope they put the missing episode on iPlayer.
"I get they didn't want to show it and the white suits on the preview suggest a virus situation but I still wanna watch it! We've missed a massive Marty storyline! #Casualty "
Regardless of whether the BBC do eventually make the episode available to fans, Casualty will now be on a break until May 23 when it will return with its next episode.
Casualty returns to BBC One later this month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Casualty fans confused as BBC skips an 'inappropriate episode'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Casualty viewers were confused last night when the BBC skipped an episode it called "inappropriate".
Fans had been expecting to watch a gripping episode culminating with a showdown between Ethan and Will - but instead it was replaced by a catch-up and the following week's episode.
The extended preview at the start was designed to fill in the gaps on what fans would've seen in the axed episode.
A voiceover announcer said: "The episode we were due to watch tonight, filmed before the spread of COVID-19, was considered inappropriate to show at the moment.
"But never fear, everything we need to know from that episode is in a catch-up right at the start of the programme."

However glimpses of the episode from the preview showed characters dressed in full protective gear, suggesting an epidemic style storyline.
Such a plot would too closely mirror real life events with the current pandemic.
But that didn't stop fans being confused about what was going on.
And they were still desperate to see the missing episode.
One said: "Really, really disappointed at the missing episode of #Casualty, especially when it’s so pivotal to current storylines.
"The showdown between Will and Ethan would have been great to see 😢 #Casualty @BBCCasualty"
A second said: "#casualty I would have liked to have seen that episode."
A third said: "I really wanted to see the episode that they skipped #Casualty."
It comes after BBC controller Piers Wenger admitted Casualty is unlikely to resume filming soon.
Speaking at an Edinburgh TV Festival online Q&A, he said: "We do have to abide by the rules and while social distancing is in place it is going to be difficult.

"There are ways of cheating, actors being close enough together to interact in a scene."
He added: "We’re not quite at that point yet.
"But all of those conversation are being had and there is a real determination to get that show back up and running."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Romeo Beckham, 17, celebrates first anniversary with girlfriend despite lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Romeo Beckham has celebrated his first anniversary with girlfriend Mia Regan with some cute snaps.
The 17-year-old son of David and Victoria Beckham is currently separated from his girlfriend due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Romeo is currently staying with his parents and younger siblings, Cruz Beckham and Harper Seven Beckham.
The family celebrated patriarch David's 45th birthday on Saturday with some rather cute tributes, but now Romeo has his own milestone to mark.
The lad posted a selection of throwback snaps with Mia, who is also known by Mimi Moocher.
The pics came with the caption: "Happy 1 year mooch love u so much @mimimoocher."
Meanwhile, Mimi posted her own tribute to her boyfriend from afar.
The photo of the pair snuggling up came with the caption: "Special times more to come."
Romeo has previously shared an insight into the pair's Valentine's Day trip to Paris earlier this year.
The pair posed for a mirror selfie together and visited the legendary Louvre museum.
Rumours of a romance between Romeo and his lady-love were seemingly confirmed when Mimi attended a private family dinner with Romeo to celebrate Victoria's Fashion Week show.
Meanwhile, Romeo isn't the only Beckham kid to be loved-up.
Older brother Brooklyn Beckham, 21, is currently residing in the US with his actress girlfriend, Nicola Peltz.
Unlike Romeo, Brooklyn is separated from his family as he remains in lockdown with his partner.
That didn't stop Brooklyn from sending dad David his own sweet birthday message on Saturday, however.
Brooklyn shared a throwback photo of him with his father, writing on the Instagram post: "Happy birthday to the best dad in the world x you are my best friend and I love you. @davidbeckham."
Elsewhere, Romeo's own tribute to his footballer Dad read: "Happy birthday dad I love you so so so so much and hope you have the best day. Sorry for being officially taller than you now."
We're sure David is proud of all his boys - and not forgetting little Harper Seven, too!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Romeo Beckham celebrates first anniversary with girlfriend Mia Regan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Romeo Beckham is clearly a charmer like his father as he showered his girlfriend, Mia Regan, with all the love in celebration of their first anniversary this weekend. 
The 17-year-old was feeling very sentimental as he shared cute photos of them together from the past year and it seems the honeymoon phase isn’t over just yet. 
‘Happy 1 year mooch love u so much,’ Romeo captioned the Instagram post. 
Romeo’s aunt and David Beckham’s sister Joanne had all the feels over Romeo’s sweet sentiments and commented: ‘Oh my god this is the cutest ever 😍 happy one year guys ❤️.’ 
Although they’re celebrating their one-year anniversary now, the young lovebirds were only linked back in September 2019 when Mia was spotted with Romeo at his mum Victoria Beckham’s London Fashion Week showcase. They kept it lowkey during the runway show but were spotted sitting together during the family dinner at Harry’s Bar in Mayfair later that evening. 
In November 2019, Megan then wished Romeo a happy birthday on Instagram to which he replied: ‘Happy b day Mooch. Hope you have a lovely day xxxx p.s. loving the glasses,’ making their relationship Instagram official. 
Since then, it’s been a whirlwind romance for Megan and Romeo, who whisked the model off to Paris – the city of love – for a romantic weekend in December. They took in all the sights, including the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe, while also hanging out with friends. 
Mia also joined Romeo and his family as his dad David launched his new football team Inter Miami CF in March. 
At the moment though, the couple appear to be separated by the coronavirus lockdown with Romeo self-isolating with his parents Victoria and David, and siblings Cruz and Harper in the UK, while older brother Brooklyn remains in the US with his girlfriend Nicola Peltz.
The family enjoyed even more celebrations as retired footballer David celebrated his 45th birthday. 
Romeo posted a celebratory message to his old man, which read: ‘Happy birthday dad I love you so so so so much and hope you have the best day ♥️sorry for being officially taller than you now.’ 
David quipped back: ‘It’s all because the ManBun.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">BGT unseen clip sees 10-year-old wow judges with Chuck Berry's Johnny Be Good</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 10-year-old guitarist wowed the judges on Britain’s Got Talent with Chuck Berry’s classic Johnny Be Good.
In an unseen clip from the ITV talent show, we meet little rock star, Joseph Sheppard who had the crowd eating out the palm of his hand.
Before his audition, Simon Cowell complimented his hair while Amanda Holden commented on his ‘great style’.
Donning a leather jacket and his guitar Joseph asked the audience: ‘Are you ready to rock Manchester?’
And it’s safe to say no one expected him to perform the way he did.
Joseph got fantastic feedback from the judges after his audition as Simon said: ‘Let’s go to the rock expert on the panel, David.’
‘You are so cool, such a little dude and you’re very very skilled I mean that is not easy to sing and play the guitar like that,’ David Walliams commented.
‘I think you’re going to be a huge star well done.’
Alesha Dixon added: ‘I was so impressed, your stage performance was fantastic, the way you owned it in front of all these people.’
While Amanda continued: ‘You are the complete package here, that was a brill audition.’
And of course, Simon Cowell had the last word as he said: ‘Very good Joseph that was a great audition, going forward in five years time where do you see yourself?’
Joseph simply replied: ‘Hopefully quite famous.’
Other acts that wowed the judges on Saturday night’s instalment were 96-year-old Nora and a group of dancing turtles.
And not forgetting Amanda Holden’s golden buzzer act, which was Honey and Sammy, a mother a daughter act from Essex.
Britain’s Got Talent returns on Saturday at 8pm on ITV.

Vulture’s honorary husband was delighted at the brief interruption (“special guest star!”), and as a win-win, we also got to learn about his current livestock preferences. (You forgot he’s a nice Missouri boy, didn’t you?) “Is there a duck? What about a chicken? Duck or chicken,” Hamm demands, “anything with a beak.” Cattle is a close second, and don’t you dare mention swine. He has enough Hamm as it is.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Wicks is back home with family after a hospital stay to have hand surgery.
The fitness coach was admitted to Kingston hospital in London after falling off his bike.
He has now been sent home to recuperate, and shared the moment he was reunited with his children on social media.
The 33-year-old was met at the front door by Indie, who then took a selfie of her dad.
In a sweet Instagram video, Joe walked into his kitchen where his one-year-old daughter Indie and baby son Marley, born in December, were sitting on the kitchen table.
As he watched them playing, he told them how much he had missed them while he was in hospital.
After cooking up a wholesome frittata for his family, he then settled down for a nap with baby Marley, calling it ‘heaven’.
After having surgery on his hand, the father-of-two said he was feeling ‘fantastic’.
In an update from his hospital bed, Joe said: ‘The antibiotics have well and truly kicked in. The inflammation and the swelling has gone right down.’
He shared that he will be resuming his popular P.E. lessons for the nation on Monday morning.
Joe’s wife Rosie will be helping him out in the upcoming session as he might not be able to demonstrate certain excercises due to his injury, but he ‘doesn’t want to let anyone down’.
‘It’s well out of her comfort zone but she’s my best friend and she knows how much this means to me,’ he went on.
‘I don’t want to let anyone down but I don’t think I’m going to be able to demo many exercises so I’ll be having Rosie on camera with me.
‘I’ll still lead the session and coach you through it. I’ll just have Rosie demonstrating the moves.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JOE Wicks has returned home to his family following his recent hand surgery.
The Body Coach - who underwent surgery for a persistent injury on his hand - was all smiles as he played with his young children at his home in Richmond today.
Taking to Instagram, Joe, 33, revealed he had returned home from the hospital to be greeted by one-year-old daughter India.
Alongside a snap of the adorable tot and son Marley in the kitchen, he wrote: "So happy to be home with my family."
Joe and little India were later spotted playing on a climbing frame in the garden.
The fitness guru - famous for giving the nation daily PE lessons on YouTube - underwent surgery this week.
Sharing a snap from his hospital bed, he explained: "They aren't able to do the operation today, they have other patients in the queue.
"They are a bit slower with certain things so I'm staying tonight.
"They're going to give me some nice morphine, and some antibiotics on the drip-a-roo. In the morning, hopefully first thing, I'll be having the wires taken out."
He added later: "I tell you what, this infection is no joke. I've had codeine up to my eyeballs. They gave me liquid morphine, but it ain't taking the edge off it. It's throbbing."
He added: "I've got a drip of liquid paracetamol. That is absolutely fantastic. Paracetamol IV saves the day for now, almost instant effect and on the pain.
"So glad I'm staying here tonight. I woke up all night last night as it was throbbing and pulsating like liquid hot magma.
"Thanks for all your well wishes. Gonna get a good night's sleep I think."
Following the procedure, the fitness star shared a short video on Instagram from his hospital bed and said it looked like they'd "left a golf ball" under his bandage.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Michael Jackson abuse accusers to try and sue firms linked to the late star</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two men who accused Michael Jackson of sex abuse are expected to return to court next month to take action against firms linked to the late star.
Wade Robson, 37 and James Safechuck, 42 - who appeared in the documentary Leaving Neverland last year - are reportedly going to sue MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures.
Both Wade and James claim they were molested as children by the late popstar.
According to The Sun, the men want to prove the allegations were true and reveal that firm bosses were aware, or should have been.
Michael Jackson's estate is still exempt from facing legal proceedings.
“We’re finally back in the courtroom," their attorney Vince Finaldi is reported by the publication to have said.
“We were supposed to have a hearing a couple of weeks ago, but it has been delayed due to the coronavirus – so we have another date set for June.
“It will be the first hearing in the case. It’s a new judge and it will be resolved one way or another. We are preparing for a trial later in the year.”
Both Wade and James previously attempted to sue the companies in 2013 and 2014.
However, their case was thrown out in 2017 after a trial judge said they had waited too long to file the allegations.
At the time Californian law required claimants to file before they turned 26 - but Wade and James were both in their thirties.
This changed at the beginning of 2020, when a new law came into effect that allowed victims of sexual abuse to sue until they are 40 years old.
Both Safechuck and Robson detailed a string of abuse claims in the 2019 documentary Leaving Neverland.
Michael Jackson's estate and his family have continued to deny the sex abuse claims.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'American Idol': Top 11 Revealed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Following last week’s top 20 performances filmed in the contestants’ homes, the pool was chopped in half on Sunday night. The top 10 voted through by viewers had to sing virtual, at-home performances again, and judges Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie provided remote feedback. The judges also opted to use their one save of the season to form a top 11.
Former Idol Phillip Phillips opened the show with his very fitting song “Home,” and then the first results were announced. Louis Knight was voted through, and for his next at-home performance, he sang “In My Place” by Coldplay, accompanying himself on the keyboard while his family watched. He brought the emotion, but it wasn’t the most vocally impressive. “It pulled at my heartstrings,” Perry said. Bryan said he wasn’t completely blown away.
Also voted through was Julia Gargano, who gave a gritty performance of “In Her New York State Of Mind” by Billy Joel, showing off her tone and ad libs. It was a good song choice, and Bryan went so far as to call it his favorite performance of the year so far, giving it a 12 out of 10. Richie said she made it her song.
Jovin Webb delivered another smooth and captivating performance, singing “Voodoo” with an impressive delivery. “It’s magic,” Richie said. Perry said she felt transported by the performance. “You did not hit one bad note,” Bryan added.
Grace Leer also advanced, singing “Over the Rainbow” in an understated and technically impressive performance. She put some of her country twang into it, and Perry said she had never heard her voice like that before. “It was like you were singing to thousands.”
Jonny West sang “Faithfully” by Journey while playing the keyboard for his performance, and he put a lot of soul into it. Bryan praised his ability to make it seem effortless and commended his “well placed falsetto moments.”
Also voted through, Sophia James sang an understated and intimate arrangement of “In My Room” by the Beach Boys. She also played the keyboard. “You’ve done the work in terms of sussing out where your delivery sweet spot is,” Richie said. “It was so upper-echelon,” Perry added.
Arthur Gunn joined the advancing artists, giving a performance of “Country Road” by John Denver while playing the guitar. He made it his own with his signature tone and sound. “I felt so much more connected to that performance,” Perry said. “That was amazing.” He definitely put his own spin on the popular country hit.
Singing “Grandma’s Hands” by Bill Withers and dedicating it to her own grandmother, Just Sam made it through. It was another really strong song choice, and Just Sam has completely come into her own. Perry again felt transported, and Bryan praised her range.
Also voted through was Dillon James, who sang an up-tempo arrangement of “Yesterday” by The Beatles and played the guitar. He had a lot of runs and ad libs. “You have an absolute sound to your voice,” Richie said. Perry wanted more breath to it, and Bryan agreed.
The last artist to get voted through was Francisco Martin, who sang “Falling Like The Stars” by James Arthur and played the guitar. It was an emotional and tight performance. “You really know how to get a lot of emotion out of the song,” Bryan said. Richie gave a shout out to Martin’s song, who is a first responder.
The judges then opted to use their one save of the season on Makayla Phillips, who sang “The House That Built Me” by Miranda Lambert after securing her spot in the top 11. She got emotional about being able to advance. “I’m so glad you came back to allow America hear how great of a singer you are,” Bryan said of the 17-year-old singer.
Lauren Spencer-Smith, Franklin Boone, DeWayne Crocker, Cyniah Elise, Kimmy Gabriela, Aliana Jester, Faith Becnel, Nick Merico and Olivia Ximines were eliminated from the competition. The top 7 will be revealed and sing against next week.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ESPN’s “The Last Dance” continues tonight with two more episodes, the first of which will be dedicated to Kobe Bryant.
It has been over three months since Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven others died in a tragic helicopter accident in California. The basketball world will never be the same, and many fans are still grieving over the loss of one of the game’s all-time greats.
Episode 5 of the last dance, which airs tonight, touches on the relationship between Bryant and Michael Jordan. It has been well-documented how Kobe emulated MJ and wanted to follow in his footsteps. Tonight’s episode will recount some of their interactions over the years, including when their careers overlapped.
Lakers legend and former team executive Magic Johnson thinks the footage could have a healing effect on those still mourning Kobe. He told the Los Angeles Times‘ Arash Markazi that the episode will have a profound impact.
“It’s going to mean a lot to a lot of people, especially [in Los Angeles], and it’s going to mean a lot to Kobe fans,” Johnson said. “They’re going to need this. Nobody is past what happened. It will mean something to them and all of us who are Kobe fans and Lakers fans.”
Considering the sudden and senseless nature of Bryant’s passing, tonight will be an emotional one for anybody tuning in. Perhaps it can also be therapeutic though.
Episode 5 of “The Last Dance” debuts at 9 p.m. ET tonight on ESPN. Episode 6 will begin afterwards at 10 p.m. ET.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PUBG Mobile: Maxtern on how to make Tik Tok videos viral</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Maxtern is one of the most popular PUBG Mobile YouTube casters in the country and he has charted an unparalleled upward trajectory over the past few years. With over 720K subscribers on YouTube, 200K+ followers on Instagram and more than 320K followers on Tik Tok, the 22-year-old has been providing inspiration and entertainment in equal measure.
Apart from being a caster, Maxtern also loves entertaining his fan base on Tik Tok, an app that has become incredibly popular recently. He likes engaging with his audience by posting videos under the entertainment section and garners thousands of views on each of his videos.
Thus, I, Maxtern would want to divulge a few of my trade secrets and let the world know how you can make your videos viral and attract countless viewers.
Tik Tok is one of the best social media platforms if we use it properly. It is best for short videos and can help in making users extremely popular. However, for that to happen, the content needs to be of an immensely high quality.
Most people think that Tik Tok only promotes lip sync artists or dancers such as Beauty Khan but that is not the case. The platform promotes videos that have good audience retention.
There are 2 types of content on Tik Tok.
1. Videos that are less than 15 seconds.
2: Videos that are longer than 15-60 seconds.
The first type is one of the ways to make your video viral easily. On the other hand, videos longer than 15 sec can go viral only if average watch time is above 90%, which is hard to get in case of longer videos. Hence, most top Tik Tok users prefer to make short videos.
It depends on various factors like the topic, the quality of the content, or the extent to which the content can keep a viewer glued to the video.
Step 1:Choose your category: If you just started using Tik Tok and decide to do lip sync to rival Riyaz Ali, who has 36M+ followers, then your efforts might not be very useful. Lip sync has too much competition for a new user to establish a viewer base through the same. You should choose your own passion just like I have chosen PUBG. I built a base audience by putting videos on PUBG. Now, if I do good lip sync, my video will be watched because I have already built an image.
Once you get a base audience, try to make videos according to your audience. For example, if you have built your audience by uploading tech videos, then suddenly uploading history lectures will not get you views.
Step 2:Focus on the trend: Irrespective of the quality of your content, your videos will get viral if they follow the things that are trending currently.
Step 3:Create a professional account: If you create a professional account on Tik Tok, you can view stats and other valuable data which will help you in increasing your viewer base and in making your videos viral. .
Step 4:Upload time: Most people say that upload time matters on Tik Tok but I believe that quality matters more than the upload time. For example, if I upload a video at 2am, I might get only 1000 views till 6am. However, if those viewers watch the video for a considerable duration, it will start reflecting on the pages of the viewers who come online at a later stage.
Step 5:Get your own hashtag: Try to create your unique hashtag e.g #YourName
Many people use hashtags like #DettolHandwashChallenge in their gaming videos. 1-3 hashtags are enough to make a video viral. For example, if your video is related to PUBG Mobile and your name is Maxtern then use only #maxtern, #pubgmobile, #pubgmobileindia etc.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Top Nigerian singer, Davido, has obviously had it with being compared to Wizkid
- The singer recently announced his collaboration with international star, Nicki Minaj and a Wizkid fan tried to downplay the good news
- Davido then responded to the troll that he loves Wizkid but not his fans
The Nigerian music industry is undoubtedly a tough and competitive one with artistes always working very hard to maintain relevance seeing as tides can easily turn and they are relegated to the background.
Currently, Davido is one of the top musicians in the country but this does not mean he does not experience his own fair share of hate from trolls, especially from fans of his colleague, Wizkid, who like to compare their every achievement.
Just recently, Davido took to social media via his Twitter page to share the good news of his collaboration with international rapper, Nicki Minaj.
I can't name 99% of the singers in the country - Brymo throws shade
A Wizkid fan then saw the news as an opportunity to hate by comparing Davido’s success to Wizkid. According to the troll, if Nicki Minaj was working with Wizkid, she would have been the one tweeting about the news and not the other way round.
The troll then added that Davido should calm down because there are levels to this.
Davido was obviously not impressed with the constant trolling from Wizkid’s fans who are also known as Wizkid FC. The singer expressed as much in his reply to the troll.
According to the Risky crooner, he has great love for Wizkid but not for his fans. See his tweet below:
Interesting.
In 2019, Davido featured top American singer, Chris Brown, in his song, Blow My Mind.
Without wasting much time, the energetic singer followed up his single with the release of the music video for the project, which featured him and his foreign counterpart treating fans to a great blend of pop culture.
Davido featured on CNN, opens up about donating proceeds from D&G video to COVID-19 research (video)
Shortly after the release of the song, social media went into a frenzy with Nigerians celebrating local artistes getting the attention of their international counterparts.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The twelfth season of the popular game show Kaun Banega Crorepati, hosted by megastar Amitabh Bachchan, is all set to make its selection process completely digital amid the coronavirus pandemic. For the season's registration promo, Bachchan shot the video from his home, remotely directed by Dangal helmer Nitesh Tiwari.
Sony Entertainment Television announced that registrations will commence for the latest season from May 9 till May 22, where Bachchan will ask one new question every night on Sony TV, which can be answered either through SMS or through Sony LIV.
"For the first time in the history of KBC, the entire screening and selection will be managed digitally... This is the season of firsts and we are confident that this season will redefine the power of knowledge," Amit Raisinghani, Head - Business Planning and Communication, Sony Entertainment Television said in a statement.
The second step would be screening, where participants who have answered the registration questions correctly and have been shortlisted by the randomizer based on certain pre-defined reservation criteria, will be reached out to, telephonically, for further assessment.
The third step will be an online audition on a general knowledge test aided by video submission. The final round will be a personal interview with the shortlisted candidates, which will be conducted remotely via video call. The entire selection process will be verified by an independent audit firm.
The show will be produced by StudioNEXT and the selection process will be conducted digitally, through SonyLIV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Peter Weber Said He "Finally Got It Right" After Going IG Official With Kelley Flanagan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Following a romantic roller coaster on his season of The Bachelor, Peter Weber says he "finally got it right" with Kelley Flanagan, as per Entertainment Tonight. Kelley, who first appeared on Peter's season of The Bachelor, but was eliminated before hometown dates, was first rumored to be dating the former star after the two were spotted together in Chicago. In April, Peter addressed the dating rumors during an episode of Nick Viall's podcast Viall Files, conceding the two were seeing each other but were, "taking it really, really slow."
On Saturday, Peter confirmed his relationship with Kelley on Instagram, sharing a photo of the two kissing in an airplane. He wrote: "You caught me. Let the adventure begin." Meanwhile, Kelley made the relationship Instagram official as well, posting a throwback photo of a lanyard she'd convinced the Swedish DJ Kygo to sign, reading, "Pilot Pete — don't be dumb, pick Kelley!" In the caption Kelley wrote, "Throwback to when I met Kygo in August and got him to sign this lanyard to gift to Peter on the show!"
Peter and Kelley's romance might be a bit of a surprise to fans of the ABC reality show. During the two-part finale, Peter proposed to Hannah Ann Sluss, only to break off the engagement weeks later. Instead, he rekindled his relationship with runner-up Madison Prewett, much to the disapproval of his mom. The two parted ways days after the final episode aired. Meanwhile, Kelley placed fifth on the show, but the two reportedly reconnected on a serendipitous night out post-Bachelor, according to ET.
In April, Kelley shared her perspective on why they didn't connect as deeply on The Bachelor. During an interview with the Almost Famous podcast, Kelley hypothesized Bachelor producers weren't thrilled she had a chance encounter with Peter ahead of filming, and that the showrunners sabotaged the relationship, as per Vulture. "I saw him, things were getting in his head that he wasn’t able to make his own decision, and it just kind of p*ssed me off," Kelley told the hosts. She added that the show's producers reportedly encouraged Peter to eliminate her, especially considering the attorney was less willing to go along with reality-television shenanigans.
In April, Chris Harrison confessed the show wasn't an ideal format for the couple's relationship to flourish. "I'll take a little blame for this, the show wasn't perfect for that relationship. I don't think Kelley was right for the show," Harrison said to ET. He added that Kelley "fought the concept" and that it "was tough for her to not be in her own head."
Kelley and Peter might not have had onscreen chemistry, but it turns out the two make a good match away from the cameras.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Bachelor’s Peter Weber and Kelley Flanagan Are Dating Because Relationships Mean Nothing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sure, why not. Weeks after the duo was spotted on a very cozy date and definitely not quarantining in Chicago, The Bachelor’s Peter Weber and Kelley Flanagan have officially confirmed that they’re dating. Weber posted on Instagram over the weekend to share the news, saying that Flanagan “caught me” and he can’t wait to “let the adventure begin.” Following the finale of his Bachelor season two months ago, Weber and his indecisive behavior have rotated through three women: He was engaged to Hannah Ann Sluss for a few weeks, before dumping her to pursue a relationship with runner-up contestant Madison Prewett. (A decision that was met with furious disapproval from his mom.) However, days later Weber and Prewett announced their “mutual decision” to break-up, which initiated Weber’s interest in rekindling things with Flanagan, who was eliminated this season prior to the hometown episodes.
Flanagan has been unusually candid of late about how little she enjoyed filming her Bachelor season, saying that the show’s producers fed her “bullshit” about Weber’s feelings. She now believes this was due to how, by complete coincidence, she ran into Weber at a hotel lobby days before filming began, giving the duo a rare pre-season connection. “I told Peter, ‘They don’t let me see you. They locked me up in a closet for three hours last week, and they won’t let me see you,’” she told the Almost Famous podcast. “I said, ‘You clearly know they push some people forward and they don’t push others forward.’ It’s just — I saw him, things were getting in his head that he wasn’t able to make his own decision, and it just kind of pissed me off.” Flanagan added that the producers were constantly “in his head” and encouraged Weber to eliminate her as the season progressed, given that she wasn’t as made-for-reality-TV friendly as other contestants. (Flanagan is an attorney who did not act like a messy bitch who lived for the drama.)
Here’s hoping the third time is actually the charm, but if not, whatever.

Given the lockdown and corona situation, the family ensured that only a few close family members attended the prayer meet.
Randhir Kapoor said, “Rasam pagri puja was held yesterday. His ashes were immersed today in Banganga, Mumbai, followed by a quiet prayer service with family at his home because of the virus.”
Along with wife Neetu and son Ranbir, the late actor’s daughter, Riddhima,was also present for the prayer meet. Riddhima, who couldn’t attend her father’s final rites owing to travel restrictions, reached Mumbai on Saturday evening after taking special permission to travel from Delhi by road.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Katie Price reveals she needs therapy for life after ‘slowly going off the rails for 10 years’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KATIE Price claims she needs therapy for life as she comes to terms with 'going off the reals' in a clip from her new TV show.
The 41-year-old doesn't hold back in the hour-long special of My Crazy Life, telling viewers she's been to "hell and back".
In a teaser clip, she says: "I've been slowly going off the rails for just over 10 years.
"At times I've been a mess. I've been to hell and back, but I'm starting to feel like me again.
"Four weeks in hospital and some intense therapy that will continue for the rest of my life has got me back to being me.
"It just goes to show, if I can do it, anyone can!"
Katie recently revealed to The Sun Online how she burst into tears after being reunited with children Princess and Junior after six weeks apart.
The mum-of-five has suffered a tough time being separated from her kids in lockdown amid the coronavirus crisis.
The family were forced apart after Junior, 14, showed signs of the deadly bug while staying with his dad Peter Andre.
This week she was finally able to see him and 12-year-old Princess again.
Katie told us: “I can't believe how much the kids have grown in six weeks - Pete's had them sleeping in grow bags!
"I welled up, it’s been a tough six weeks not being able to hug them.
"After five minutes together it was back to the usual fun and craziness."
Meanwhile Katie has been staying with pals at a posh pad in Surrey - just ten minutes away from Peter - as she isolates with her eldest son Harvey.
She has been shielding the disabled 17-year-old from danger because he is at high-risk from coronavirus because of his health condition.
Her youngest kids Jett and Bunny have been living with their dad Kieran Hayler and his fiancee Michelle Penticost.
Junior and Princess have spent the last six weeks with Peter and his wife Emily - who is an A&E doctor battling coronavirus on the frontline.
It has meant Katie's kids haven't been able to all be together since lockdown began.
"It’s been hardest on Harvey because he really misses the contact with his siblings," Katie added.
"Fingers crossed we’ll be a complete unit with Jett and Bunny joining us this weekend.
"My children are my perfect pieces of heaven - they have kept me strong through thick and thin.
"Unconditional love is free and means everything to me.”
The 41-year-old reality star posted a cute video last night of Harvey, Princess and Junior clapping the NHS on their doorstep.
"It’s Thursday, so let’s show our appreciation and respect for all the incredible key workers keeping our country going", she told fans.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I For India: A historical event like I for India has been organized by Give India, which will see 85 top celebrities from both Bollywood and Hollywood come together for a virtual concert and raise funds for the frontline workers who have been protecting us from the Coronavirus pandemic. Right in the beginning, the event saw Tiger Shroff surprising fans by crooning a Varun Dhawan song. While we have seen him carry off some daredevil stunts in the past, this was definitely a first for all his fans.
Putting on his sunglasses as he is shy, Tiger Shroff sang Theher Ja from the Varun Dhawan starrer October. He also sang one of his favourite songs, Roop Tera Mastana, from Aaradhna. Later when Arjun Kapoor came on the screen to encourage the audience to donate for the fund, we noticed Groot’s action figure kept as a showpiece on his shelf, making us wonder if the Panipat actor is also a big Marvel fan, just like us. Arjun requested people to donate generously for those who are struggling for shelter and food.
Kartik Aaryan also took everyone by surprise as he didn’t use any monologue this time. He simply requested fans to donate for those affected by the lockdown by stating that this time he is not here to deliver long monologues, but instead wants people to donate with large hearts. Until now many actors in the concert have made an appeal to stand united in these tough times.
The four-hour-long concert live on Facebook will feature performances and personal messages from over 85 Indian and global stars including Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Hrithik Roshan, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Vidya Balan, Shabana Azmi, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Alia Bhatt, Arjun Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan, Rani Mukherji, Madhuri Dixit Nene, Akshay Kumar, Diljit Dosanjh, Dulquer Salmaan, Katrina Kaif, Vicky Kaushal, Anushka Sharma, Ayushmann Khurrana, Tiger Shroff, Sophie Turner, AR Rahman, Bryan Adams, Mindy Kaling, Gulzar, Javed Akhtar, Jay Sean, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Jonas Brothers, Amaan Ali, Ayaan Ali, Shankar Ehsaan Loy, Sonu Nigam, Anoushka Shankar, Arijit Singh, Badshah, Rekha Bharadwaj and others.
Directors such as Farhan Akhtar, Farah Khan, Karan Johar, Kiran Rao, Zoya Akhtar will also be there.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">So much fun! Kourtney Kardashian, 41, posted a cute Instagram pic of her daughter Penelope Disick, 7, and niece North West, 6, reuniting for a fun day in the sun on Saturday, May 2. It looked to be a great minds think alike kind of deal, fashion wise, for the youngsters as they twinned in their adorable matching outfits! Both of the girls wore white tank tops and colorful sweatpants that were different variations of the color pink. Kim Kardashian & Kanye West‘s eldest child also sported a pink sweatshirt tied around her waist with her hair up in a bun. The girls did differ in the shoe department, however, as North opted to wear pink sandals while Penelope had on orange sneakers.
Vroom vroom! North and Penelope looked to be spending part of their day getting in some exercise as the latter was seen chilling with her bike outside. Her father Scott Disick, 35, has been enjoying a much different kind of vehicle as of late as he’s been seen on the beaches of Malibu on his motorbike with girlfriend Sofia Richie, 22. The longtime couple have been escaping quarantine over the past month with Sofia stunning in a variety of gorgeous bikinis that effortlessly highlight her amazing figure.
Penelope and North’s reunion happened just weeks after the KarJenner clan put on one epic birthday bash for Kourtney amid them being in self-isolation. They pulled off an amazing drive by where everyone from Khloe Kardashian, 35, to Kendall Jenner, 24, parked in front of her house and celebrated their beloved family member while Rihanna‘s song “Birthday Cake” played in the background.
Kourtney and her kids appear to be doing A-OK during their time in quarantine. The mother/daughter duo made hearts melt when they recreated the iconic pasta scene from the classic Disney film Lady & The Tramp in an Instagram video posted on Monday, April 20. “My lady,” the doting mother captioned the snap. Aww!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cindy Kimberly Lounges In Bed Rocking A Savage x Fenty Look</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Ava Bennet
Brunette bombshell Cindy Kimberly recently shared a sizzling triple Instagram update with her 6.3 million Instagram followers in which she showcased her buxom body in a Savage x Fenty ensemble. In the caption of the post, Cindy explained that she was an ambassador for the brand, and she showed off a pink set in the sexy snaps.
Cindy was stretched out on a bed with white linens, and a few silver pillows scattered around her. She had a magazine open on the bed in the first snap, but her attention was on the camera rather than the reading material in front of her. Cindy rocked a bright pink bra that showcased a tantalizing amount of cleavage, and a hint of matching pink bottoms were visible. Her long brunette locks tumbled down her chest and shoulder in an effortless bedhead style, and her bronzed skin looked incredible.
Cindy parted her lips seductively in the shot, and had a soft pink hue on her plump pout. Bold brows framed her brown eyes, and she had a sexy smoky eye done in shades of bronze and brown for a more subtle look. Cindy also had a heavy dose of blush and highlighter, giving her a gorgeous glow.
The second shot was taken from a different perspective, and showed Cindy laying down on the bed with fluffy white linens surrounding her. She paired the bralette top with some skimpy shorts that barely covered anything at all. Her brunette locks were spread out around her, and her curvaceous physique looked incredible in the skimpy set.
For the third and final snap, Cindy returned to her sprawled out position and rested her curvaceous hips and thighs on one of the silver pillows while her hands were on another pillow. She posed in a way that accentuated her hourglass physique and showcased the bright pink Savage x Fenty pieces.
Her followers couldn’t get enough of the triple update, and the post racked up over 617,400 likes within just 20 hours. It also received 2,058 comments from her eager fans.
“GIRL OMG,” one fan exclaimed, unable to handle Cindy’s beauty in the shots.
“This girl is something else,” another fan said.
“Thanks for actually having a real body and being even more beautiful bc of that,” one follower commented, loving Cindy’s curvaceous physique.
“Ma’am you’re too hot,” another cheekily said.
Whether she’s rocking lingerie or swimwear, Cindy loves to showcase her tantalizing curves. Just a few days ago, as The Inquisitr reported, Cindy shared a double update taken somewhere outdoors with a row of greenery and flowers visible behind her. She wore a skimpy and feminine white bikini top that dipped low, showing off plenty of cleavage, and accessories with a two gold necklaces and a pair of small hoop earrings.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Star Wars threat: study
The Star Wars military program had the potential to “tear the Western Alliance apart”, the Australian-born director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Dr Robert O’Neil, said. Star Wars, officially called the Strategic Defence Initiative, had reopened the old arguments of the late '60s about the desirability of anti-ballistic missile systems. Dr O’Neil was launching the institute’s 1984-85 Strategic Survey.
No sale of the century
“A champion contestant on the television quiz show Sale of the Century has been forced to return all her prizes after the producers discovered she had appeared on the program before,” wrote entertainment reporter Richard Glover. “She did well during her first appearances on the show 2½ years ago. During her second try, recorded over the past few weeks, the woman did even better, winning eight episodes.”
Rector quits over wine
“An Anglican rector is to quit his parish in a dispute concerning the use of non-alcoholic grape juice in Holy Communion. The Rev Lance Keogh, rector of St Barnabas’s, Oberon, is at loggerheads with the Bishop of Bathurst, the Rt Rev Howell Witt, who adopts the traditional line that fermented or alcoholic wine should be used. It was hinted that the rector was concerned with the situation of recovered alcoholics.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vanessa Hudgens Sizzles In A Polka-Dot Bikini As She Takes On The Splash Challenge With Her Sister Stella</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Treva Bowdoin
Vanessa and Stella jumped up and down on a cement divider.
Vanessa Hudgens rocked a skimpy bikini and risked taking a spill to participate in a TikTok challenge. On Sunday, the 31-year-old High School Musical star took to Instagram to share her attempt at the viral splash challenge with her 39.2 million followers. Her younger sister, 24-year-old Players actress Stella Hudgens, performed the somewhat dangerous stunt with her.
The challenge could have ended with the two sisters getting wet, so they both wore bathing suits to give it a shot. Vanessa was rocking an eye-catching string bikini from model Emily Ratajkowski’s swimwear line, Inamorata. Her top was dark blue, and it featured a small polka-dot print. The garment had scanty triangle cups that left little of the actress’ pert cleavage to the imagination.
The top also had halter ties around the neck and extremely long back ties that wrapped around Vanessa’s toned and tan tummy multiple times. She was wearing the strings tied in front so that they trailed down her lean torso.
Vanessa’s bathing suit bottoms were white with dark blue polka dots. They had high-cut leg openings and a low front. The design highlighted her shapely hips and made her slender legs appear slightly longer. Vanessa was also wearing a shiny black bucket hat on her head.
Stella was rocking an off-white bikini that featured a tiny floral print. She was also wearing a black baseball cap. Both sisters appeared to be wet, but they weren’t in the water when their video was filmed. Instead, they were standing on a thin concrete barrier separating a pool from a hot tub. The barefoot siblings were holding hands.
Stella was shown leaping up and kicking both feet behind her, and Vanessa immediately followed her lead. The sisters both laughed hysterically when they managed to land back on the barrier without slipping and falling in the water.
According to The Daily Mail, the object of the splash challenge is to stand near a body of water and to touch both toes on the water’s surface at the same time without falling in. This involves kicking the feet back while keeping them down low and quickly bringing them back forward to land safely on land.
Stella appeared to skim the water with one foot, while Vanessa seemingly didn’t touch it at all. However, the actress’ fans didn’t seem to mind watching her fail. As of this writing, her video has received over 329,000 likes.
“Jiggles on fleek,” read one response to her post.
“Two perfect beautiful goddess thank god,” another fan wrote.
However, a few commenters suggested that what the sisters were doing was dangerous.
“Looks like the break your neck challenge smh,” read a third remark.
Vanessa isn’t the only High School Musical star filming wacky pool videos. On Saturday, Ashley Tisdale uploaded a goofy mini music video costarring her inflatable llama float. For her performance, Ashley wore a pink bikini and mouthed the words to the song “I Want It All.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cindy Crawford, 54, Rocks Daisy Dukes & Looks Identical To Daughter Kaia, 18, In New Photo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cindy Crawford, 54, one of the original queens of wearing Daisy Dukes, showed off a look similar to the one she wore in her famous 1992 Super Bowl Pepsi ad in a new Instagram pic on May 3, and it also had her looking just like her 18-year-old daughter, Kaia. The former supermodel wore a red Chicago Bulls jersey, a pair of denim shorts aka Daisy Dukes, and blue and black sneakers in the new snapshot, which showed her leaping mid-air while attempting to get a basketball into a basketball hoop. With her long wavy brown locks tied back into a ponytail and her profile in view, Cindy looked stunningly similar to Kaia, proving her youthful features are still clear as day.
Cindy used the photo’s caption to admit her outfit in it was from the 1990s and also took a moment to give a shout-out to the new docu-series The Last Dance, which is about former Bulls player Michael Jordan. “This is what happens when you take a girl from Illinois and put her in Jordans and a jersey that @DennisRodman gave her back in the 90s,” she wrote in the caption. “Getting ready to watch #TheLastDance tonight on @espn (and @netflix outside the US). You can also check out the pre-show chat on ESPN’s Facebook Live at 530pm est! Special shout out to my action photographer @randegerber. (And, please notice my shadow… tribute to the GOAT!)”
Although Cindy didn’t specify whether or not the Daisy Dukes she’s wearing in her latest Instagram pic are the same ones from her memorable Pepsi ad, we can’t help but wonder. The brunette beauty recently spoke in a live video chat with fellow model Naomi Campbell, 49, on Naomi’s new YouTube show No Filter, on Apr. 6 and talked a little about the clothes she wore in the ad. “I still have the shorts I was wearing in the Pepsi commercial because they happened to be the jeans I was wearing that day that we just cut off because of course my own jeans fit better than anything they had,” she told Naomi in the episode. “And it was funny because I ended up doing that commercial 10 years later after I had kids and we wore the same shorts so I felt some small victory in that.”
It’s awesome to see Cindy still looking amazing after all these years! Whether she’s wearing her Daisy Dukes or some other piece of casual or elegant fashion choice, she seems to always get just the right amount of attention!

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Huge and very creepy': Vancouver Island woman stumbles upon rarely seen spider</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VANCOUVER -- Krysten Leigh was walking her dog in Langford when she spotted something that made her do a double-take.
"He was pulling at something and it got my attention and when I looked over there was a spider," Leigh said. "I definitely had to take a second look because it was huge and very creepy-looking."
The arachnid on the pavement in front of her was like nothing she'd ever seen before. She wondered if it was someone's pet. She also wondered if it was poisonous. Mostly, she knew she had to take a picture.
"It wasn't as big as a tarantula, but it definitely looked like a miniature version of one," Leigh said.
Experts say the spider she spotted is a Pacific folding trap-door spider. It's not a tarantula, but it is a "tarantuloid" - a related type of arachnid - according to Jaymie Chudiak, general manager of the Victoria Bug Zoo.
"It is the closest thing we have to a tarantula," Chudiak said. "They are incredibly beautiful, but also very large, so people who do see them go, 'Oh my gosh, what is that? It's enormous.' But they're actually extremely docile and timid."
Pacific folding trap-door spiders typically grow to between three and five centimetres in length, considerably smaller than tarantulas, but larger than most species commonly seen in B.C.
"They do have venom, but it's incredibly mild," Chudiak added.
Asked what she did after she took the photo, Leigh said she "ran away."
"I was terrified," she said. "I'm definitely not a spider person."
She shared the photo she had taken with her mother, and then with a pest control company, which was eventually able to confirm the spider was a native species and not an escaped pet.
Leigh then shared the photo on Facebook, where it generated much more attention than she expected. In the first 24 hours, her post was shared more than 200 times, she said.
Chudiak said Pacific folding trap-door spiders are "absolutely everywhere" on Vancouver Island, but people rarely see them because they spend most of their lives hidden away inside their burrows.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The late Bollywood icon Rishi Kapoor created a minor record even after his demise! Online search for the actor rose by 7000 per cent in India, and 6700 per cent globally after he passed away.
On April 30, a study by SEMrush found that fans posted 6,214 tweets on hashtag rishikapoor. Other hashtags, which were used included rishi_kapoor, riprishikapoor, riprishikapoorji, and riplegend. On these hashtags, fans tweeted 1,040 times, 995 times, 564 times, and 475 times respectively. A total of 14,394 tweets were posted about Rishi Kapoor on the day of his death.
The study further shared that the most used emoji was one expressing utter shock. 2,988 people used it. The second most used emoji was a broken heart. The third most used emoji was of a crying face with massive tears falling out of each eye. This emoji was used 961 times.
The fourth most used emoji was a tearful face with a single tear falling from the left eye. It was used 630 times. The fifth and sixth most used emojis were a bouquet and a broken black heart. Each emoji was used 556 and 484 times, respectively.
Speaking about the results, Mr. Fernando Angulo, Head of Communication, SEMrush said: “The news of Rishi Kapoor’s passing away was an unbelievable loss for entire Indian film industry. He was the true boy-next-door with a killer smile and dapper attire… While Rishi Kapoor will certainly be missed, his huge body of work remains and will ensure the actor continues to entertain audiences for generations to come”.
Rishi Kapoor passed away on April 30 after a two-year battle with cancer. The 67-year-old actor breathed his last at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital in Mumbai.
His death was confirmed Amitabh Bachchan, who had tweeted: “”T 3517 – He’s GONE .. ! Rishi Kapoor .. gone .. just passed away .. I am destroyed!,” Amitabh tweeted on Thursday.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One Pokemon fan has recreated the entire Sinnoh map from Pokemon Diamond & Pearl in Animal Crossing: New Horizon.
Reddit user assaultepic shared the fruits of their labor in a post over the weekend (via NintendoLife), showing Pokemon’s Sinnoh map brought to Animal Crossing.
Made using New Horizons’ unofficial island map editor Happy Island Designer, assaultepic describes how they expanded the Pokemon theme beyond the map.
“I made some custom hoodies with the starters and put them in Able Sisters so that the villagers can ‘pick their starter,'” they write. “Not seen any do so yet though.”
“I’ve also been trying to make the villagers look like gym leaders by giving them clothes. So far I’ve got Volkner Ricky and a few others.”
Animal Crossing: New Horizons has quickly become a platform for creative projects and mash-ups since its launch. Last month Reddit user Kazoo-E released their painstaking recreation of early 2000s music videos recorded in Animal Crossing, while last week YouTuber Mako Ray unveiled their own AC project: An Animal Crossing cover band.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Random: Pokémon's Entire Sinnoh Map Has Been Recreated In Animal Crossing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We've seen recreations of EarthBound towns and entire Zelda maps in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and now a player who goes by the name assaultepic on Reddit has shared their creation of the fourth generation Pokémon region, Sinnoh.
This particular region was first introduced in Pokémon Diamond & Pearl on the Nintendo DS in 2006.
It was apparently as simple as searching for an image of the map on Google, importing it into the Happy Island Designer web app, and then following the grid lines in-game.
The creator says the Pokémon theme has also been expanded upon:
Although the map looks good from above, admittedly it's "not at all" practical to live on:
What do you think of this recreation? How does it compare to your own island? Leave a comment down below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Diana’s famous Travolta dress stuck in ‘isolation room’ during lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A dress famously worn by Diana, Princess of Wales, remains stuck in lockdown before it can be displayed to the public.
Diana wore the midnight-blue velvet gown by Victor Edelstein when she danced with Hollywood star John Travolta during a 1985 state banquet at the White House.
Purchased in December for £220,000 by Historic Royal Palaces, it was due to join the royal ceremonial dress collection at Hampton Court Palace.
The dress was being prepared for display when lockdown began, and remains in a workroom, described as an “isolation room”.
Newly acquired garments undergo freezing or heat treatment, to remove moths and their eggs, before joining the collection.
The collection’s curator Eleri Lynn told Hello! magazine: “The dress is basically still in isolation.
“The dress had been frozen and then we left it to thaw out for a few weeks to make sure we were not cracking any fibres or anything like that.
“We would then repack it for more permanent storage within the collection stores. But we hadn’t quite finished that process, so it’s still sitting in the isolation room.
“Without a doubt it will be on display again. It is a perfect marriage of form and function and was the perfect dress for that evening.”
Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.
Ms Lynn added: “It’s such a momentous acquisition. It’s the perfect blend of celebrity and royalty, so it’s really special that it’s now part of a designated national collection because we will preserve it for posterity.
“We exist to tell the story of our palaces and their people, and Diana is one of them. There is still such interest in Diana and the charity work that she did, so she is still hugely relevant.”

Episode II: The Attack of the ClonesIn which sinister Chancellor Palpatine hatches his plan to ensnare a thousand worlds under his reign.
Episode III: Revenge of the SithIn which your faith is tested by stiff performances but redeemed (barely) by the rise of Darth Vader.
Episode VI: Return of the JediIn which son faces father, audience chokes on Ewoks and the Empire is toppled with sticks and stones.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Avengers: Endgame Trivia #39: Did You Know Loki Was Not Supposed To Die In Avengers: Infinity War?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The journey towards Avengers: Endgame hasn’t been an easy one. In MCU’s timeline, we have witnessed the deaths of several characters. Even in Endgame, we had to bid goodbye to Iron Man, Black Widow and Captain America.
It is understandable when a superhero dies because, but sometimes, the death of a villain hurts too. Here we are talking about our favourite villain Loki. Played by Tom Hiddleston, he became everyone’s favourite since the first film, Thor (2011). The God of Mischief has died several times in MCU and tricked people only to return alive.
However, in Avengers: Infinity War, Loki died for real when Thanos choked him to death. Fans hoped to see him in Avengers: Endgame, but that didn’t happen. It was painful to see him dying as he had finally turned into a good brother to Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth). But what if we tell you that Loki was supposed to die way earlier in 2013?
Our Avengers: Endgame Trivia #39 is about Loki’s death. He was not supposed to die in Infinity War but 2013 film, Thor: The Dark World. However, the audience wasn’t happy with his death and hence, he returned in Thor: Ragnarok. About the same, Tom had said in Empire Film Podcast, “Loki’s death on Svartalfheim was written as a death. Chris and I played that scene for real. That was meant to be that he redeemed himself, that he helped save his brother and save Jane Foster but that he in the process sacrificed himself. It was something that was written, it was part of the original pitch. In test screenings, the audience didn’t accept it. There was a very strange and almost unanimous resistance to it.”
Well, the same thing happened before the release of Avengers: Endgame. When Loki was killed in Avengers: Infinity War, fans were still not ready to believe he’s gone for real. But during the promotions last year, the makers confirmed his death.
But MCU treated fans with Disney+ series on Loki who escaped in Avengers: Endgame. So it can be said that the God of Mischief might be having his tricks, but it’s the love of his fans that got him back to life again and again!
That was our Avengers trivia for today. We will share more exciting facts about your favourite film every day!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Treva Bowdoin
Chantel's large feline companion is a snow Bengal.
DJ Chantel Jeffries mentioned tigers in the caption of the Instagram upload that she shared on Saturday, but she didn’t pose with one of the big striped cats for her latest stunning photo shoot. Instead, she enlisted the help of her much smaller pet feline, Miso, while promoting a bikini with a wild cat-inspired print.
Chantel was pictured rocking an eye-catching two-piece from Monday Swimwear, the popular line of bathing suits created by Instagram models Natasha Oakley and Devin Brugman. Chantel’s bikini featured a jaguar print in shades of tan and black. The spotted pattern was photo-realistic, almost making it appear as though it was constructed out of real fur.
Chantel’s bikini top featured thin spaghetti straps, underwire, top-stitching details, and molded demi cups that put her ample assets on full display. Her matching bottoms had a high-leg cut, a mid-rise waist, and moderately-sized sides. The garment showcased Chantel’s slender hips and shapely thighs. The model was also flaunting her flat, sculpted stomach.
The musician accessorized her swimsuit with a gold treble clef pendant necklace and a delicate charm necklace.
Chantel was wearing her dark blond hair down with a natural wave. For her beauty look, she rocked an earthy pink color on her plump pout. Her shimmery eye shadow was a pale pink hue, and her eyelashes were coated with just a smidgen of dark mascara. She was also wearing peach blush on her sculpted cheeks, and she was rocking a bold dark brow. Chantel’s flawless bronze skin had an allover glow.
Chantel chose to model her wild bikini in front of a dark jungle-green wall. The spiny tips of a large agave plant’s succulent leaves were visible in the right corner of her photo. She was posing with her left leg crossed in front of her right leg. Her left arm was hanging down at her side, and she was holding her large snow Bengal, Miso, in the crook of her right arm. The feline was intently staring at something to the right of the camera. Miso’s snow-white fur with gray spots popped against the dark wall and Chantel’s tan skin.
Since it was initially posted, Chantel’s photo has received over 300,000 likes and 1,000 comments. Many of her fans referenced the hit Netflix docuseries Tiger King in their responses to the model’s picture and caption, with a few commenters jokingly referring to her as “Chantel Baskin.”
“You can lock me up and put me in prison. Call me Joe Exotic,” read one response to her post.
“Carole baskin comin for Chantel next,” another fan wrote.
The model’s photogenic feline also received a lot of love.
“Miso looks so godly in here,” one admirer remarked.
Chantel doesn’t just model bikinis. As reported by The Inquisitr, her fans also went wild over photos of the gorgeous DJ rocking lingerie from Rihanna’s Savage X Fenty lingerie line.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rebel Wilson Unzips for Flirty Quarantine Photoshoot Following Dramatic Transformation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actress and comedian Rebel Wilson is thriving in quarantine, and we are in absolute awe! The 40-year-old actress took to Instagram on May 2 to share snapshots from her smoking at-home photoshoot, showing off a slimmed-down figure while sporting a light blue tracksuit. Flaunting her enviable, curvy figure while rocking an unzipped hoodie and exposing her black bra, Wilson captioned the carousel of snaps: "At Home With Rebel" alongside a kissy emoji. The photos have raked up more than half a million likes, and a plethora of comments.
In the first snap, Wilson channels her inner Victoria's Secret model, posing on top of her lush white sofa and smizing like a professional. In the following image, the Pitch Perfect actress stands defiantly in front of the camera, with her leg popped out with her fingers at the bottom of track suit jacket's zipper. In her last photo, Wilson channels her Cats role as she crawls toward the camera.
Fans chimed into the fiery shoot, expressing their enthusiasm over the shoot with a string of emojis including flames, heart eyes and kissy faces. "Woah.. well hello Rebel [eye emoji] your (sic) such a little Rebel.. [heart eyes emoji] but when are u gonna tell us about what u was rehearsing the other day?" wrote one fan, as another added, "Work it girl!" Meanwhile another fan wrote, "Damnn Rebel Wilson !! Looking beautiful as always."
At the beginning of the year, Wilson wrote in an Instagram post that 2020 would be "The Year of Health," admitting it was time to put herself first. "I put on the athleisure and went out for a walk, deliberately hydrating on the couch right now and trying to avoid the sugar and junk food which is going to be hard after the holidays I've just had but I'm going to do it!" she wrote. "Who's with me in making some positive changes this year?"
According to Hollywood Life, Wilson's dramatic transformation is all thanks to trainer, Jono Castano Acero who told the outlet that he encourages clients to an "extra bit" of cardio every day to keep moving. "A little tip is to get a watch or use your phone to count steps and aim for 10 thousand steps a day," he said. "If you're on 9000 steps at 10pm, you have to get it done." The fitness trainer adds that while Wilson is "one of the sweetest souls" he's ever met, the pair oftentimes end up burning a major dose of calories from all their laughing together.
The actress has long been an advocate for plus-size women and launched her own fashion line in 2017 called Rebel Wilson X Angels, designed specifically for sizes 14 to 24.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zandra Rhodes says 'shy' party pal Princess Diana couldn't hide one bad habit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Oh, I’m not enjoying myself, I really am not,’ is the opening line from Dame Zandra Rhodes, who is not having a nice time in lockdown.
‘I’ve got a lovely penthouse with a roof garden, camellias in full bloom and my lilies are coming out, but it’s like a weird, rubbish holiday. Do you know what I mean?’
Lockdown might hit harder for iconic fashion designer Zandra because The Real Marigold Hotel has just landed on our screens and she’s being reminded of her glorious trip to India.
She was lucky enough to take the journey of a lifetime along with fellow celebrities such as Bond Girl Britt Ekland, Duncan Bannatyne and Paul Chuckle.
‘It was a fabulous experience,’ she beams. ‘Britt is an old friend anyway and legendary cricket commentator Henry Blofeld is known as the man with the golden voice if you’re my age!’ she giggles.
'It was a lovely experience being plonked together with people I didn’t know that well and having an adventure. And of course I adore India, so the culture shock didn’t bother me. I’m not sure they all liked it though,’ she says, clearly remembering a few difficult moments from the trip.
Despite some guests on the show (Zandra’s tight-lipped about who) not enjoying the experience, there were a few factors that made it tricky even for seasoned travellers.
‘Blimey we had to organise a night’s sleep for ourselves when we got there!’ Zandra exclaims. ‘I’ve been lucky that every time I’ve visited before I’ve been looked after very well, but there we all were, getting our own tickets for trains and getting lost and all sorts!’ she laughs.
‘I did sneak off and have a cup of tea with the woman who had done all the beading for me for years on my dresses, so that was wonderful,’ she smiles. ‘I had to leave the show early though as my partner had fallen ill. But I still had a lovely time.’
The fashion icon sadly lost her long-term partner, Salah, in June of last year, and has moved back to her hometown of London for the time being while selling their San Diego house. It’s obvious she is feeling the loss even more in the current climate.
‘I’ve got a lot of tasks I’ve had to put on hold,’ she tells us. ‘My partner and I lived in San Diego, so when he died I packed up the home as I didn’t need a huge house, but I ended up putting a load of stuff in storage thinking I could go back to it,’ she sighs.
‘Well, funny how life turns out, eh! But I’m finding it all extra hard as I like working and being around people. I can ignore them, don’t get me wrong,’ she laughs, ‘I like just having people in my consciousness. A lot can be said for a nod or a smile,’ she says sadly.
‘My sister lives round the corner from my London flat and she rings me every morning and evening to check I’m OK,’ she tells us. ‘But the life we had together in America was quite wonderful. He worked, I worked. He was perfect for me.’
A self-proclaimed workaholic, Zandra graduated from design college in 1963 and had made a name for herself in the fashion industry by the early 70s. Despite becoming one of the UK’s most prolific fashion designers with loyal customers such as Princess Diana and rock stars and models, she’s very modest about her achievements.
‘When I started out no one would buy my designs, so I set up a shop with Sylvia Ayton (another iconic designer who turned high street shop Wallis into a hit) and it became rather trendy,’ she tells us. ‘When it closed I thought, “I ain’t giving up now!”’ she laughs.
‘I got someone to show me how to make patterns, opened a studio in Bayswater, London, and put together some dresses. Next I took them to America and was met by the editor of American Vogue who raved about them, photographed them on Natalie Wood and then I started to sell my dresses to top shops in New York. Voilà!’
The way Zandra reflects on her career in such a nonchalant way makes us think she doesn’t like to boast about her success.
In fact, when we ask her about her friendship with Princess Diana, she goes all coy.
‘She was a very shy woman,’ she says quietly. ‘I did notice she bit her nails though!’
She also downplays her pieces she created with rock legend Freddie Mercury. ‘He and Brian May came over one evening and I made him the pleated top you always saw him in,’ she smiles.
During our chat Zandra’s phone rings constantly, (‘Oh I am good at ignoring it! Don’t worry!’), and it’s clear she loves a natter, in fact she regularly reminds us we can chat about anything we like. But she has a pretty good reason as to why looking back at her career isn’t her favourite topic.
‘It makes me feel too old!’ she howls. But appearance-wise, Zandra vows to never change her style as she grows older.
‘I’ll never, ever have grey hair,’ she tells us. ‘I have my hair bleached every eight weeks and I even re-pink it myself in between so it doesn’t go too pale. I like it nice and bright!’
Her eccentric style certainly makes her stand out in a crowd and a sense of individuality is something she had from a young age.
‘My mother was encouraging of whatever I wanted to do and I think a lot can be said for that,’ she smiles. ‘But being different has always been an accident. I’m just me.
'In fact, I had a letter a while back from a lady who said, “I used to travel on the bus to school with you and I’m so sorry me and my friends laughed at you.” I replied, “That’s nice, but I never noticed anyone laughing at me,”’ she tells us honestly. ‘I’ve always had a thick skin. And that’s lucky, this industry is impossible if you don’t have it.’
Zandra regularly brings up her late partner and loves talking about him proudly. The pair met when she was 53 – she keeps his memory alive by sharing anecdotes and hanging plenty of photographs of their happiest memories.
‘Guests love the downstairs toilet for photographs!’ she exclaims. ‘My partner with Harrison Ford and various movie stars. He was always so driven, an amazing man,’ she tells us.
When the pair met at a dinner party in New York back in 1992, Zandra was impressed by how Egyptian-born Salah was a self-made man.
‘He started as an usher in a cinema in Brooklyn and became the President of Warner Brothers,’ she tells us proudly. ‘Life was glamorous of course, but we were ordinary at home. We’d have 12 people over at the weekends and I’d cook us all a three-course meal from scratch.’
Ordinarily, out of lockdown, Zandra has fashion interns who live with her to learn the tricks of the trade. It’s an opportunity for her to get in the kitchen. ‘I have a lovely room with four bunk beds and I love making lunch for everybody,’ she tells us.
‘A nice leek and potato soup we all eat round the table. Maybe some smoked salmon and salsa. A bread and butter pudding,’ she lists, drifting off into a food daydream. ‘But cooking to be sat here on my own? Forget it! I’m bored of cooking and washing up and eating leftovers… Utterly sick of it!’
Food might not be top of the agenda at the moment, but Zandra got a chance to show off her culinary skills on Celebrity MasterChef last year alongside the likes of Oti Mabuse and Joey Essex. ‘Oti thought the boys had more help than we did. And although I didn’t win, I know for sure I was a better cook than the boys. No doubt about it!’ she cackles.
She celebrated 50 years of fabulous fashion with an exhibit and book last year, is still designing and has the ball rolling to start her own charity, so Zandra has no plans to slow down.
‘I probably should slow down,’ she says coyly. ‘But I think the easiest thing for me is to keep working and drop dead in the middle of it,’ she smiles. ‘Retiring is what I’m meant to do, but will I actually do it? Probably not.’
And with that, Zandra is off to unpack boxes, hang up more photos and tend to the plants. ‘See what I mean?’ she smiles. ‘There’s always work to be done! Oh well, l’ll get there in the end, eh?’ With a work ethic like hers, we’ve no doubt about it.
Lie-in or up early?
I never, ever lie in – 8am is the latest I ever wake up.
Healthy breakfast or fry up?
I have a bowl of cereal and a coffee. I never cook breakfast just for myself.
Chores or relaxing?
Well my normal routine has all gone to smoke! Ordinarily I’d use Sunday to visit an exhibition and cook for friends. Now I do fun chores, the washing up isn’t one of them.
TV or papers?
My TV hasn’t worked for years. I’ve never seen any of the big shows, not even that dancing programme lovely Oti is on. I don’t do papers either, I just stick to Radio 4.
Go for a walk or stay inside?
I haven’t been going for my government-approved walks, I’m very naughty. I have to try and get myself in the habit of it so I keep fit and healthy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Julie Hesmondhalgh admits feeling intimidated on Corrie set was exciting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As we return to the Lake District for the third series of this hit drama, two years have passed, but Alison (Morven Christie) and Paul (Lee Ingleby) are still learning how to handle their son Joe’s autism.
Meanwhile, the 10-year-old has a new reality to deal with, as the couple have divorced and Alison’s home is now in Manchester.
As their marriage fell apart, Paul was not in a good place, reckons Inspector George Gently star Lee.
‘He felt detached, lost, out of touch and a bit of a failure, actually,’ he says. ‘I think he was struggling in life.’
Lee reckons the show’s depiction of what having an autistic child can do to a relationship is one of its strengths.
‘It’s good to be open and honest, and we’re showing this has driven a wedge between Alison and Paul,’ he says.
‘They’ve got a family together and that’s going to keep them together anyway, so it’s how they manage that, heartaches and heartbreaks.’
With Joe’s Uncle Eddie single too, the only stable couple is grandad Maurice (Christopher Eccleston) and girlfriend Louise. Her son Ralph’s got some big news to share, though.
‘Maurice is happier than his children, which bemuses him,’ admits Christopher. ‘They’re in early middle age and splintering. Their lives are falling apart, or certainly changing.’
While Alison juggles a university course with work and Joe, there’s a hint of possible romance, after a tetchy first meeting with a single dad.
But how would Joe cope with more changes on the home front? Fans will be keen to find out – and the show’s biggest star, Christopher, says it has a special place in his heart.
‘I’m known for probably three other significant roles – Doctor Who, Our Friends in the North and Cracker,’ he says
 ‘And I’m a runner, so I’m often out and about and I get stopped a lot in the street.
‘I’m stopped just as much about The A Word as I am for those three, which has surprised me. It seems autism has impacted on every person you meet. I often get people crying and saying, “Thank you very much for doing it because we never see anything about autism on the television”.
'This show is as important to me as anything I’ve ever done.’
Julie Hesmondhalgh joins The A Word this series as Joe’s teacher Heather – and admits she is finding it nerve-racking.
‘I came in as a fangirl,’ she says. ‘This has happened from Corrie onwards, I always feel I should be at the gate with my autograph book and somehow I’ve got in!
‘I’ve had to really work at creating this persona that belongs in those environments, that isn’t, “That’s Morven Christie! It’s Chris Eccleston!"
'I’ve got to just be like, “Hi, here I am, an actor, like you, on our set.”‘
'I know, rationally, we’re all human beings with insecurities... but even at the end of Coronation Street after 16 years, I would sometimes be in the Rovers Return and be like, “What am I doing here? I’m in the Rovers. How did this happen?”
'So it was intimidating but exciting.’
– The A Word returns on Tuesday, May 5 at 9pm on BBC One

Lee reckons the show’s depiction of what having an autistic child can do to a relationship is one of its strengths.
‘It’s good to be open and honest, and we’re showing this has driven a wedge between Alison and Paul,’ he says.
‘They’ve got a family together and that’s going to keep them together anyway, so it’s how they manage that, heartaches and heartbreaks.’
With Joe’s Uncle Eddie single too, the only stable couple is grandad Maurice (Christopher Eccleston) and girlfriend Louise. Her son Ralph’s got some big news to share, though.
‘Maurice is happier than his children, which bemuses him,’ admits Christopher. ‘They’re in early middle age and splintering. Their lives are falling apart, or certainly changing.’
While Alison juggles a university course with work and Joe, there’s a hint of possible romance, after a tetchy first meeting with a single dad.
But how would Joe cope with more changes on the home front? Fans will be keen to find out – and the show’s biggest star, Christopher, says it has a special place in his heart.
‘I’m known for probably three other significant roles – Doctor Who, Our Friends in the North and Cracker,’ he says
‘And I’m a runner, so I’m often out and about and I get stopped a lot in the street.
‘I’m stopped just as much about The A Word as I am for those three, which has surprised me. It seems autism has impacted on every person you meet. I often get people crying and saying, “Thank you very much for doing it because we never see anything about autism on the television”.
'This show is as important to me as anything I’ve ever done.’
Julie Hesmondhalgh joins The A Word this series as Joe’s teacher Heather – and admits she is finding it nerve-racking.
‘I came in as a fangirl,’ she says. ‘This has happened from Corrie onwards, I always feel I should be at the gate with my autograph book and somehow I’ve got in!
‘I’ve had to really work at creating this persona that belongs in those environments, that isn’t, “That’s Morven Christie! It’s Chris Eccleston!"
'I’ve got to just be like, “Hi, here I am, an actor, like you, on our set.”‘
'I know, rationally, we’re all human beings with insecurities... but even at the end of Coronation Street after 16 years, I would sometimes be in the Rovers Return and be like, “What am I doing here? I’m in the Rovers. How did this happen?”
'So it was intimidating but exciting.’
– The A Word returns on Tuesday, May 5 at 9pm on BBC One

    <h5 class="mb-1">11 celebrities who have reached for hair dye while they're bored at home, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Though they might not have access to hairstylists and makeup artists while they practice social distancing, celebrities are still finding ways to experiment with their looks.
One of the most popular methods seems to be through hair dye. In recent weeks, celebrities including Ricky Martin, Hilary Duff, and Dua Lipa have all taken to Instagram with photos of themselves wearing bright new styles. Coincidentally, almost every star that’s done so has chosen either a pink or blue shade.
Here are some of the celebrities taking part in Hollywood’s latest beauty trend.
He showed off his newly-pink hair in an Instagram video about the importance of social distancing posted on March 19.
captionLauren Alaina first rose to fame on “American Idol.”
“This quarantine’s got me feeling extra blue,” the country star wrote in an Instagram post on March 19. “Probably gonna stay that way teal it’s over.”
Though she still had blue hair in an Instagram video posted on April 10, she now seems to be back to her natural blonde shade.
In an Instagram post on April 8, the actor wrote: “Today I will be channeling Sir Woody of the woodpeckers #woodywoodpecker #redhairdontcare.”
She revealed the color via her Instagram Story on March 25. While it’s unclear as to what color her hair is now, Fanning’s strands did look significantly less pink in a photo she posted on April 13.
captionKristen Stewart typically wears her hair in blonde and brown shades.
On March 29, Stewart’s hairstylist CJ Romero shared a photo of her new color, writing: “Who said you can’t be cute in quarantine!? ????????‍♂️Hair cut on @emmaroberts and Cut and Color on Kristen!! ????????‍♀️????????‍♂️????????.”
He later shared more details about how to achieve her bright-orange hair, which he describes as being a “cosmic rust” color.
“The smile of a girl who just did at-home hot-pink highlights because what else can I do right now!” she wrote in an Instagram post on April 1. “Thanks @limecrimemakeup, these hair conditioners are easy and so fun! @nikkilee901 don’t be mad lol. I really miss you! Hey @911onfox, new look for Maddie?!”
On April 4, the model and actress wrote about experimenting with box-dye on Instagram.
“I added some pink in my hair and it was my first box-dye experience and I didn’t fry my hair off weeeeehooooo,” she wrote.
She shared a photo of her new style and color to Instagram on April 12, writing: “????????‍♀️yea.” She later appeared on a live Instagram video with her husband Matthew Koma, who took credit for dyeing her hair.
She also wrote about her new color on Instagram as part of a “Quarantine diaries” entry on April 16.
“This week’s experiment… pink hair,” she wrote. “That’s kind of it really – I haven’t acquired a new skill but I have joined World of Warcraft and I have two pets on it called mintsaws and little sheena (one’s a dragonhawk and one’s a tiger).”
Lipa revealed her new color through Instagram on April 26. In the caption of her post, she called her new shade “orangina quarantina ????.”
On Instagram, she said she’d wear the temporary dye until it washes out.
“Well, because we’re still in quarantine, I had to think of a new and creative way to embarrass my children,” she said in her video on April 28. “Quarancolor!”
In an Instagram post on May 1, the actress wrote: “What can I say!? Sometimes you just need to feel blue and other times you need pink to lighten your day.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Classic Corrie episodes unlocked after filming halted</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The broadcaster is putting ‘vintage’ episodes of Coronation Street and Emmerdale on its on-demand platform.
ITV is unlocking classic episodes of its soaps after production on new instalments was halted.
“Vintage” episodes of Coronation Street and Emmerdale will be placed on its on-demand platform, ITV Hub.
It comes as filming of both soaps has been stopped and transmission reduced to make the episodes which have already been recorded last longer.
Emmerdale will run out of episodes at the end of May, while Coronation Street will last until after June.
The episodes, airing every weekday on ITV Hub from Monday, will give “soap fans a trip down memory lane and a chance to relive some of soapland’s most iconic characters,” ITV said.
Coronation Street episodes from 1995, featuring Weatherfield characters Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), Alec Gilroy (Roy Barraclough), Mavis Wilton (Thelma Barlow), Raquel Wolstenhulme (Sarah Lancashire) and Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), will go on the platform.
Emmerdale will go back to December 1995, ahead of villainous Chris Tate’s (Peter Amory) wedding, and in the midst of Kim Tate’s (Claire King) affair.
The broadcaster is already screening classic episodes on ITV3.
It comes after ITV bosses said that Coronation Street and Emmerdale could return to screens with older cast members absent and actors six feet apart.
ITV Hub will also feature previous episodes of The Real Housewives Of Cheshire and Gemma Collins’ fly on the wall show Diva Forever.

Stephen Fry and footballer Troy Deeney have signed up to the BBC’s education efforts.
Doctor Who star Jodie Whittaker and EastEnder Danny Dyer are among the previously-announced famous faces leading online lessons.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Boy George says he was too “engaged chemically” to take part in Live Aid.
The Culture Club frontman did not perform at the landmark concert despite singing on Band Aid’s track Do They Know It’s Christmas.
The singer, 58, told the Grounded With Louis Theroux podcast: “I messed it up. I was otherwise engaged chemically.
“I mean, I think it was a stroke of luck that we didn’t do it because I wasn’t in a fit state to do it.”
He said: “We were originally asked but then I think everyone was just looking at the state of me and going, ‘this might be more harmful than good’. So, they basically didn’t follow up on it.”
The singer also told Theroux, 49, he thought the presenter was on drugs when he watched him on Graham Norton’s show last year.
He later deleted a tweet asking: “What’s wrong with Louis Theroux?”
The Karma Chameleon singer said: “One of the things as a recovering addict is I often watch people of TV and I go, ‘They are off their nut’. Most times I’m completely wrong.”
Grounded With Louis Theroux is available to listen to on BBC Sounds every Monday and is also broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Wednesday at 8pm.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Advertisement -
Cosmetics mogul Kylie Jenner is enjoying her quarantine time with new hair and makeup makeovers. Her latest look is stunning. The reality star looked great with an ombre ponytail that she featured in a video on her Instagram account on Wednesday. The model also collects a huge number of hairpieces and extensions. Kylie has shown several looks over the past week such as a straight blond look as well as a tie-back ponytail. She has also appeared without her extensions, showing her natural hair at shoulder-length.
The mother-of-one said that the reason why she changes her look so often is that it is an addiction that makes her feel like a new person. Sharing in a post, the Lip Kits founder said that she first coloured her hair when she was 16. She had it coloured blue and she did not tell her mother. Since then, she has been addicted to changing her hairstyle. It makes her feel like a new person and she loves feeling different. Kylie added that she loves leaving the house knowing that nobody has ever seen her this way.
Kylie moved into a new home in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles during the quarantine period.

This week, she and her best friend Stassie created a series for TikTok and recreated funny Keeping Up with the Kardashian clips. The massive residence was shown in the clips, with the amazing swimming pool as well as teasers into the gym and cinema. Prior to her new abode, Kylie lived with her mother Kris Jenner in Hidden Hills. The model also has a house in that neighbourhood. Kylie and her daughter Stormi seem to be enjoying themselves with Kris as Kylie shared videos of them in the mansion. There are clips of them dressing up for a TikTok video, as well as Stormi playing in the swimming pool. Kylie uploaded a funny video of Kris sleeping in the living room in the middle of the day too. /TISG

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kylie Jenner is flaunting her curvy beach body in revealing bathing suit photos that she shared with her 173.2 million Instagram followers. Kylie went viral after photos of her without any makeup on and carrying a bag of chips as she went to see a friend made their way online. Since that event, people have accused the 22-year-old billionaire of staging photoshoots in order to remind people that she’s really gorgeous. No one doubted her beauty, and many people responded to the photos by saying that she looked better as her natural self. Still, it seems that Kylie is most comfortable with darker skin, an exaggerated lip line, and hairpieces. Like her sisters, Kylie is frequently accused of undergoing plastic surgery to alter her figure and also like her sisters, she denies going under the knife. Still, Kylie’s figure has changed drastically and she continually shows it off in skimpy bikinis on her social media platforms.
In the newer photos, Kylie Jenner was seen straddling a board in a swimming pool. She is wearing a Love Wave bikini. The Nadia bikini top costs about $98 and the Campbell Bottom costs about $75. The bikini features a shimmery pattern in pastel pink, blue, and yellow. Kylie Jenner shared photos of herself in multiple poses including several pictures where she stood up and showed off her curvy backside to the camera.
You may see the photos that Kylie Jenner shared with her Instagram followers in the slideshow player below.
Kylie Jenner, like many other celebrities, may be missing the days when social distancing wasn’t the norm and she could go travel to exotic locations living the luxurious life with friends and family on a yacht. Kylie went to the Bahamas shortly before the pandemic hit and has since been under lockdown in her home.
She shared additional photos of herself seated in a wooden beach chair while wearing a bikini on Instagram. You may see those photos below.
Are you having a hard time with social distancing and staying home? Can you relate to Kylie Jenner’s photo caption where she was wished she was on the beach?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India skipper Virat Kohli, limited overs vice-captain Rohit Sharma and tennis star Sania Mirza were among sports personalities who took part in an online concert to raise funds to fight the Covid-19pandemic, which has killed over 2 lakh people globally.
As part of the initiative by ‘iFor India’, actors, musicians, singers, sportspersons and business leaders came together to entertain people from their homes in a bid to help the Covid-19 pandemic cause.
The proceeds from the concert will go to the India Covid Response Fund set up by GiveIndia, a donation platform.
“Two weeks ago, we started work on India”s biggest concert. To entertain people who are locked-down at home. To pay tribute to those who work on the frontlines while we work from home. And to raise funds for those who have no work and no home,” a message from #IForIndia, the concert for our times, said.
Among others to attend the concert were Kohli’s actress wife Anushka Sharma, Shah Rukh Khan, AR Rahman, Ustad Zakir Hussain, Aamir Khan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Alia Bhatt, Ayushmann Khurrana, Bryan Adams, Gulzar, Nick Jonas, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Ranveer Singh, Shreya Ghoshal, Sonu Nigam, Sophie Turner, Zoya Akhtar and Vidya Balan.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On Thursday, NBC aired the reunion episode of the cult classic Parks and Recreation, which has currently raised a whopping $2.8 million USD for charity.
The feature episode brought back together all the series’ lovable characters, including Amy Poehler (Leslie Knope), Nick Offerman (Ron Swanson), Aziz Ansari (Tom), Rob Lowe (Chris), Adam Scott (Ben), Chris Pratt (Andy), Aubrey Plaza (April), Rashida Jones (Ann), Retta (Donna) and Jim O’Heir (Jerry). There were also special appearances from Paul Rudd, Mo Collins, Jay Jackson, Jon Glaser, and Ben Schwartz.
As of writing, the episode brought in $2.8 million USD in donations from viewers, all of which will go towards Feeding America’s COVID-19 Response Fund, an initiative to feed those in need at various food banks across the U.S. during this pandemic. In addition to the nearly $3 million USD raised, NBCUniversal, the show’s cast as well as producers have together pledged a matching donation of $500,000 USD, while State Farm and Subaru are also donating $150,000 USD each.
Explaining why they decided to make a reunion, the episode’s co-writer Mike Schur told Entertainment Weekly: ”Because now you’re thinking with a different calculator and you’re thinking to yourself, ‘Well, there are a tremendous number of people who need help, and there’s a tremendous amount of potential energy in the idea of this group of people getting back together. And if you could combine those two things and use the ‘one-time reunion’ as a way to be noisy and to try to get people happy for half an hour and maybe to throw 25 bucks at a website — that’s something worth doing. If we could pull it off, it would be worth it. So the joy of making this project and this little special is that I had this whole argument of why we should do it prepared, and I never had to make the argument because the second that I suggested it to everybody, they all said yes! [Laughs] So it came together very quickly.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Taylor Swift had a sweet surprise for a Utah nurse.
Whitney Hilton, a registered nurse, shared the message and collection of Lover items she was sent on her 30th birthday after helping out at Northwell Health’s Long Island Jewish Medical Center.
“I wanted to send you some presents and to let you know I am so grateful for you,” Swift wrote. “I can’t thank you enough for risking your life to help people and for spreading the message loudly that people need to hear about taking this seriously.”
She added, “Also, I saw the photo of you from my show! Thank you for coming! I would love to give you a hug next time and thank you in person. With love and admiration, Taylor.”
Last month, Hilton wrote a blog post published by Intermountain Healthcare, where she described her journey from Utah to Long Island to help out in what she called “a modern war.”
“This is a humbling experience,” Hilton said in the post. “I have so much to say but almost too overwhelmed to say it all. New York has been hit HARD. The people need help, the nurses need help, the doctors need help, everyone needs help. This is crisis mode like I’ve never seen. This is an incredible experience, albeit the hardest thing I’ve ever done AND equally the most rewarding.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Taylor Swift gave a fan one of the best surprises ever!
The 30-year-old “The Man” singer Whitney Hilton, a registered nurse in Utah, with a handwritten note and a bundle of Lover merchandise.
Taylor‘s surprise wasn’t only in honor of Whitney‘s 30th birthday, but a homecoming gift after the nurse returned to Utah after helping out at Northwell Health’s Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New York amid the ongoing health crisis.
“I wanted to send you some presents and to let you know I am so grateful for you,” Taylor wrote. “I can’t thank you enough for risking your life to help people and for spreading the message loudly that people need to hear about taking this seriously.”
Taylor continued: “Also, I saw the photo of you from my show! Thank you for coming! I would love to give you a hug next time and thank you in person. With love and admiration, Taylor.”
Back in April, Whitney wrote a blog post published by Intermountain Healthcare, where she described her 2,200-mile journey to lend a helping hand during the pandemic, which she called “a modern war.”
“This is a humbling experience,” Whitney wrote. “I have so much to say but almost too overwhelmed to say it all. New York has been hit HARD.

    <h5 class="mb-1">You Have To Use Cheats To See The Only Hidden Watermelon In Half-Life: Alyx</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Watermelons could be found hidden in a few spots throughout Half-Life 2. But for whatever reason only one melon is hidden in Half-Life: Alyx and it can’t even be seen unless players use console commands.
As documented in a recent video by Half-Life superfan MarphitimusBlackimus, there is a single melon in Half-Life: Alyx. It is hiding in a box early on in the game, in a section where Alyx is exploring a basement while Combine soldiers walk around outside the windows. However, this melon is actually hidden from the player’s sight unless they use “noclip” to leave the basement. Then and only then can you see the lone melon.
Things were much different back in Half-Life 2. In that game, released back in 2004, dedicated melon hunters could find six watermelons throughout the game. And a few more in deathmatch levels. MarphitimusBlackimus made a whole video about these melons too.
The new melon model seen in Alyx sports a brand new texture, looking better than the melons seen in Half-Life 2. Sadly, it can’t be broken into melon gibs. When shot it just poofs out of existence.
It seems in 2020 the budget for melons has been slashed. Maybe one day Valve will update Half-Life: Alyx to bring back the melons and right this wrong. They went back and patched the original Half-Life last year, 20 years after the game was first released.
I just don’t want to wait that long for my VR watermelons.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zoë Bell Fights Nearly Every Famous Woman in Hollywood in This Quarantine Fight Scene</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One big gap in all of our nerd lives during the drought in Hollywood releases brought on by the pandemic is the lack of good fight choreography. Crunchy, thrilling, silly, engaging fight scenes are some of my biggest delights in genre fiction, and oh, do I miss them. So does stuntwoman, actress, and stunt choreographer Zoë Bell. So she did what she could.
In a lockdown-style video (you know the drill by now, a bunch of personally shot little clips threaded together), Bell recruits some of the coolest and most dashing women in Hollywood to throw down. Or, as she puts it, “play a game.” Bell, the stunt double for stars like Lucy Lawless in Xena or Uma Thurman in her role as The Bride in Kill Bill, is extremely well connected, so the list of stars she’s able to pull here is pretty stunning.
Like, have you ever wanted to see Florence Pugh throw down with Hallie Berry? Zoe Saldana vs. Thandie Newton? Margot Robbie vs. Cameron Diaz? Well, this video will give you a little taste of that action. It’s not quite the same as a full-on Hollywood fight scene, but it’s plenty fun. It even works in some great fight scene tropes, including the furious realisation that, hey, I’m bleeding! and the waffling to find a weapon that you’re willing to break over your opponent’s head. There’s also a cameo appearance from, well, I’ll let you guess which one I’m talking about.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One big gap in all of our nerd lives during the drought in Hollywood releases brought on by the pandemic is the lack of good fight choreography. Crunchy, thrilling, silly, engaging fight scenes are some of my biggest delights in genre fiction, and oh, do I miss them. So does stuntwoman, actress, and stunt choreographer Zoë Bell. So she did what she could.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During the filming of Lil’ Dicky’s new series for FXX, Dave, David Burd had to work hard to avoid showing his genitals to the world. E! Online recently picked up on an interview with David Burd on Pop of the Morning with Victor Cruz.
Burd explained to the host what it was like to take all of his clothes off on set. Fans of the hit television show know that Burd loves to add awkward sex scenes and also demonstrate the bizarre relationship he has with his own genitalia.
When asked what it was like to strip down, Burd explained, “it’s a bit weird.” According to Burd, between takes when he went to get a coffee or something to drink, he had to wear a skin-toned color thong which had to be edited out through CGI.
David joked that part of the problem was the “overflow,” in other words, the fact parts of genitalia were slightly slipping out of his underwear. David said the last thing he wanted was to have his private parts somewhere in the studio’s archive.
In the same interview, the Professional Rapper explained what it was like to work with Kourtney Kardashian. At one of Justin Bieber’s house parties, David Burd’s character runs into the reality star. David said Kourtney was one of the “nicest” people he has ever met.
David went on to praise the Kar-Jenner clan, stating that every member was incredibly nice. Moreover, Dave explained that he thinks Kourtney was happy to be doing something outside of reality television for a change. He thinks she enjoyed it.
Regarding Justin Bieber’s appearence on the series, David Burd explained that Justin may actually appear on his next album, but such an endeavor hasn’t been planned yet. In other words, Justin isn’t on it at the moment.
According to Burd, the album features a whole host of emotions and styles. On some tracks, it’s emotional and serious; others are funny, and in some, he’s showing off his rap skills.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Review: Band member takes over Billy Joel's Facebook, and does him proud </h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DelGuidice's livestream show began with a pre-recorded enthralling live version of "Nessun Dorma" at London's Wembley Stadium with Billy Joel himself accompanying him on piano, and that instantly lured his audience in his set.
He went on to perform a stunning piano-driven version of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah," which is very fitting in the fitting times that we are living in today. This version was so moving that it certainly moved his virtual audience to tears.
"God Bless, good evening everybody," he said. "How are you guys doing? My name is Mike DelGuidice and I want to say hello to everybody. This is 'Live on the Porch,' and it's an exclusive episode. I want to thank Billy Joel, my boss, who has been gracious enough to allow me to do this broadcast from my home. I am very grateful for his generosity and his heart."
"I miss the band, the crew, and everybody, and seeing their faces," he said. "I know we will see each other soon again. I am sending love and prayers to everyone," he added, optimistically.
He tipped his hat to Billy Joel with the soothing "Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)" from his multi-platinum-selling River of Dreams album. "Thank you so very much. I really appreciate it," he said, effusively.
DelGuidice dedicated his original tune, "Where Do The Heroes Go" to all of the workers on the frontlines and the heroes as he sent them "peace and love." He switched over to acoustic guitar and sang it in a sultry, expressive fashion, showcasing his rich, rumbling voice. Equally moving was "The Living Years" by Mike & The Mechanics, which was filled with melancholy. "Thank you so much," he said.
He continued with yet another powerhouse original song, and he went on to perform "Two Thousand Years," which he declared as one of his all-time favorite Billy Joel songs. He allowed his wide range as a singer-songwriter and instrumentalist to shine on this latter tune. "What an amazing song," he exclaimed.
DelGuidice concluded his 40-minute set on Billy Joel's Facebook page with the acoustic "Until The End," thus leaving his virtual fans thirsty for more. "Thank you, everybody. God Bless you all," he said and reiterated his gratitude to Billy Joel for allowing him to perform on his Facebook platform.
The Verdict
Overall, Billy Joel allowed Mike DelGuidice to perform on his Facebook page and that was a real treat for the musical world. DelGuidice embodied all the songs that he was singing, and he sang with a great deal of heart, soul, and conviction. He certainly made his "Piano Man" boss proud, and the same holds true for his hundreds of thousands of listeners.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bolshoi ballet soloists limber up in lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Moscow, Russia | AFP |  In the middle of their bedroom, Bolshoi ballet dancers Margarita Shrainer and Igor Tsvirko have placed a linoleum mat and a barre.
Since the start of the lockdown, the couple, both soloists in the legendary troupe, have largely used their own initiative to keep up their dance skills at home.
The Bolshoi held its first online classes only this week, more than a month after lockdown began.
Yet Tsvirko and Shrainer still look toned and Tsvirko pulls at his waistband.
“I don’t think I’ve got fat, that’s the main thing,” says the 30-year-old dancer, a leading soloist at the Bolshoi who has performed lead roles in “Ivan the Terrible” and “Nureyev”.
Shrainer, a first soloist who has performed major roles in “Coppelia” and “Carmen Suite”, massages her leg with a tennis ball and moves into the splits.
Together for more than a year, they are living in a studio flat owned by the theatre.
The same block is home to several other dancers and it was outside this building that the notorious acid attack on then-artistic director Sergei Filin took place in 2013.
Their Zoom class is led by a teacher doing steps in his bedroom to a piano accompaniment.
There are leaps and energetic dance routines. At the end, Shrainer sits with her legs stretched out in front of her.
“We got some cardio,” the 26-year-old says.
Afterwards they goof around, Tsvirko performing lifts with Shrainer.
“As for dancing as a duo, yes we probably are lucky that we can keep up this form,” Shrainer says.
The dancers had to find their own ways to create a lockdown routine and find equipment.
– ‘Only stronger’ –
As lockdown began, “the Bolshoi gave very important and worthwhile advice: keep yourself fit and find a way to do ballet in self-isolation,” says Tsvirko.
“That’s what we performers are doing: finding linoleum, barres.”
Normally dancers do not train at home so do not have such equipment, Tsvirko says.
As they spoke, the theatre brought round rolls of black dance linoleum, a special type with a strong grip.
Even their ballet shoes are “wearing out” as they cannot collect new supplies, Tsvirko says.
The theatre’s general director Vladimir Urin told Kommersant daily in early April that it was unfeasible to hold online classes for the 250-strong troupe.
Tsvirko suggests the management did not initially see how online video conferences could be used.
“I think it’s primarily due to the fact that some people weren’t familiar with technical innovations that exist now.”
General director Urin has said his “good” scenario is for the theatre to reopen for the new season in September and Tsvirko says he anticipates such a timeframe.
“I doubt anyone will start working before September or anything will open so I’ve steeled myself for such long holidays.”
Meanwhile both are developing hobbies.
Tsvirko is learning to play the guitar while Shrainer has got into cooking, pilates and learning English.
She says she misses the bustle of the theatre: “There’s not the usual pace, rhythm, constant rehearsals, meeting colleagues, sitting in the cafeteria.”
Tsvirko says he misses the anticipation ahead of going on stage.
“That atmosphere when you come in and warm up and you talk to your favourite wardrobe masters, your makeup artists — that process of going in, the slight butterflies, that’s probably what I miss most.”
Going back will not be easy, they acknowledge.
“After such a long time of strict precautionary measures, how will men even shake hands? I think everyone will be keeping their distance a bit,” predicts Shrainer.
Physically there will also be “a tough comeback period for the performers, of regaining strength,” she says.
Theatre-goers will be changed too, says Tsvirko. “Audiences will definitely observe precautions: probably they’ll sit in masks and gloves.”
Beyond the virus, the economic realities have changed, he adds.
“Russia for sure is also in an economic crisis, like the whole world basically, so the question is the cost of tickets.”
Urin told Kommersant that he fears opening later than September could mean financial disaster due to planned premieres.
But the dancers are ultimately optimistic the revered troupe will return with renewed energy.
“I hope people won’t get weaker over this time but only stronger,” says Tsvirko.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BTS Thanks Fans For Voting Them As Favorite Music Group On KCAs: ‘This Is Amazing’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BTS is back on American airwaves! All seven of the guys — J-Hope, Suga, Jungkook, V, Jimin, Jin, and RM — popped up on Nickelodeons’ Kids’ Choice Awards on May 2 to accept their blimp for Favorite Music Group. As the orange award hilariously “flew” into the room, RM, 25, spoke on the groups’ behalf. “What up, what up?” he began, sporting a white t-shirt with a multi-colored image and black jeans. “Favorite music group at Kids’ Choice Awards! Wow, this is amazing, thank you so much! So happy to get this award,” he added, as the rest of the group cheered on. “We sent this blimp around the world for you guys!” host Victoria Justice said, before cutting to the short video.
Earlier in the day, Jungkook, 22, nearly broke the internet with an epic cover of ballad “Never Not” by Lauv. “We were so beautiful/We were so tragic/No other magic could ever compare/Lost myself, seventeen,” he sang along to a guitar melody, showing off his impeccable vocals. Jungkook was casual in just an oversized gray t-shirt and beige pants as he belted out the emotional ballad sitting on his bed. “Never Not,” the official BTS twitter account posted, adding a purple heart.
The boys are always known for their impeccable style, and Jimin even had a viral moment just last week for his silver Chanel chain necklace! The eye-catching diamond piece featured the legendary brands’ iconic CC interlock, along with several colored gemstones. Jin also showed off their swag with with a denim Balenciaga logo jacket, while Yoongi rocked a t-shirt from Justin Bieber‘s go-to line Essentials.
BTS recently had fans begging for a collaboration with rapper Daddy Yankee after Suga, Jin and Jimin busted a move to his track “Con Calma”! The video was posted to their WeVerse account, and they showed off their insane choreography to the club-ready tune. While there’s no word on whether or not fans’ wishes will be coming true, it would be epic if it was true!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Child's Play writer John Lafia dies aged 63</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Writer John Lafia, who was responsible for the classic horror film Child’s Play, has died at the age of 63.
John passed away on Wednesday (29 April), with the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s office reporting his cause of death as a suicide.
His family released an official statement through Child’s Play creator and screenwriter Don Mancini to confirm the sad news, who described John as a ‘crucial part’ to the Child’s Play franchise.
‘We’re devastated to hear of the passing of our friend John Lafia,’ the statement read. ‘He was a crucial part of the Chucky family from the very beginning.
‘He co-wrote the original Child’s Play script along with director Tom Holland and myself, and John directed Child’s Play 2 – the consensus favourite film among Chucky fans.
‘John was an incredibly generous artist. He let me tag along with him to every meeting, and shadow him on set; he taught me more about filmmaking during the production of that movie than several semesters in film school.’
Don added: ‘John was also one of the most naturally curious and constantly creative people I ever met, someone who was always taking pictures and jotting down ideas.’
As well as helping to write the first two films in the Child’s Play franchise, John is also credited with coming up with the name for Chucky – the film series’ main antagonist – as well as the line ‘Hi, I’m Chucky, wanna play’ from the original movie.
More recently, he had a writing credit on the 2019 reboot, which starred the likes of Aubrey Plaza and Gabriel Bateman, and Mark Hamill as the voice of Chucky.
In addition to Child’s Play, John was also responsible for writing films such as Man’s Best Friend and Firestorm: Last Stand At Yellowstone, as well episodes for Babylon 5 and The Dead Zone.
He is survived by his two children Tess and Kane, who he shared with ex-wife Beverly.

“Child’s Play” creator and screenwriter Don Mancini confirmed the news of Lafia’s passing in a Facebook post, writing:
Lafia was credited with coming up with the name “Chucky” for the freckle-faced doll, who was possessed by the soul of a serial killer and contributing the cinematic classic line, “Hi. I’m Chucky, wanna play?”
“Child’s Play” film went on to perform well at the box office and won a Saturn Award for best horror film along with a nomination for best writing. Lafia received a writing credit on the 2019 “Child’s Play” remake.
Lafia made his feature film directorial debut with 1988’s “The Blue Iguana,” which he wrote, directed and produced the soundtrack. In 2004, he wrote, directed and produced the NBC earthquake disaster miniseries “10.5,” which became the highest-rated miniseries of the year, garnering 20 million viewers over two nights. “10.5: Apocalypse,” a sequel created by Lafia, followed in 2006.
In 2012, he independently released his passion project, a musical drama called “The Ballad of Frank and Cora,” which he wrote, directed, shot and edited, as well as co-produced the soundtrack with musician Bill Jones. The film featured lead vocals from Lafia and Michele Rene. It was Lafia’s final film.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tony Allen, Drummer Who Created the Beat of Afrobeat, Dies at 79</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tony Allen, the drummer who created the steadfast, subtle beat of the Nigerian protest funk known as Afrobeat, died on Thursday in Paris. He was 79.
His manager, Eric Trosset, said the cause was an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
From 1964 to 1978, Mr. Allen worked with the bandleader Fela Ransome-Kuti, who became known worldwide simply as Fela. He was the musical director for Fela’s band Africa 70, which forged music that was both politically committed and danceable, merging West African styles with American jazz and funk.
Mr. Allen made more than three dozen albums with Fela and the band, including the indelible “Zombie” and “Gentleman,” as well as solo albums on which Mr. Allen led Africa 70. The music of Fela and Africa 70 reached listeners and emulators all over the world. On Twitter, Peter Gabriel wrote, “As a musician & aspiring drummer, it was thrilling to get lost in their new, smart, sexy & political music full of killer grooves.”
The songs that defined Afrobeat, with Mr. Allen’s drumming at their core, move at a deliberate, unhurried tempo, geared for marathon six-hour sets and dancing until dawn. On albums, many of Fela’s 1970s Afrobeat songs stretched the length of an LP side.
While Fela composed the parts for the band’s other instruments, Mr. Allen created his own drum parts. His playing was open-ended and improvisatory rather than bluntly repetitive; complex patterns drove a shifting dialogue with every element of the band. “You listen to it flowing like a river,” Mr. Allen explained in a 2016 interview with The Guardian.
After he left Africa 70 in 1979, Mr. Allen went on to an international solo career, leading his own bands and collaborating with rock, jazz, reggae, R&B and electronic musicians. The composer and producer Brian Eno, a fan since the 1970s, once called Mr. Allen “perhaps the greatest drummer who ever lived.”
Tony Oladipo Allen was born on Aug. 12, 1940, in Lagos, then the capital of Nigeria. He was the eldest of six children of James Alabi Allen, a Nigerian auto mechanic, and Prudencia Anna (Mettle) Allen, whose family was from Ghana.
As a teenager he learned electronics and worked as a radio technician — skills that would come in handy in his early days as a touring musician, when he repaired the band’s amplifiers. He didn’t start playing drums until he was 18.
He had grown up listening to West African music, but he also immersed himself in jazz, studying the drumming of Gene Krupa, Art Blakey, Max Roach, Elvin Jones, Philly Joe Jones, Tony Williams and others. “These guys were telling a story by playing different rhythms, and they were doing it with independent coordination,” he said in the 2013 book “Tony Allen: An Autobiography of the Master Drummer of Afrobeat,” which he wrote with Michael Veal. “That’s the way the drums should be played, man.”
As he taught himself to play, Mr. Allen became particularly interested in the pedal-operated pair of cymbals known as the hi-hat, which he felt other African drummers neglected. The whoosh, rustle and ping of his hi-hats animated Mr. Allen’s drumming with an additional layer of polyrhythm.
“I’m creating different patterns with my four limbs,” Mr. Allen told The Guardian in 2014. “They are all playing something different, which means you need to split your mind into four elements with the one central idea running through.”
Martin Perna, the founder of the Brooklyn-based Afrobeat band Antibalas, which performed with Mr. Allen in the 2000s, said Mr. Allen “was the embodiment of rhythm.” He added, “What’s so magical is with all that variation, he’s somehow more hypnotic than a pattern that doesn’t change.”
Mr. Allen soon found work in Lagos highlife bands and groups that played whatever was popular. In 1964 he auditioned for Fela Ransome-Kuti, who was putting together a jazz band, beginning a 15-year musical alliance that survived chronic disputes over getting paid.
That first band’s pure jazz drew only small audiences, and Fela soon decided to combine jazz with African pop; as Fela Ransome-Kuti and His Koola Lobitos, the band played what it called “highlife jazz.”
The group toured Nigeria and neighboring Ghana. In the late 1960s a Ghanaian promoter, Raymond Aziz, came up with a new name for their musical hybrid: Afrobeat.
During a lengthy stay in Los Angeles in 1969 when the band was on tour in the United States, Fela grew politicized by the Black Power movement. When the band returned to Nigeria, Fela renamed it first Nigeria 70 and then Africa 70. His new songs were more streamlined and merged James Brown-style funk with Mr. Allen’s rolling, crackling rhythms.
“I had developed the drumming concept for Afrobeat from many things that I heard while I was growing up,” Mr. Allen said in his autobiography. “It was a fusion of beats and patterns. There was highlife, there was local Yoruba music like apala and sakara, there was jazz, and there was Western popular music like funk and R&B.”
Fela’s new songs also carried messages, at first couched in proverbs and then increasingly direct, that condemned corruption and taunted Nigeria’s military dictatorship. Although Fela and Africa 70 recorded extensively and performed regularly at his club, the Shrine, Fela was repeatedly arrested and beaten.
Africa 70 persisted, and Mr. Allen stayed on as bandleader until September 1978, when, after years of feeling musically fulfilled but financially exploited, he quit.
Mr. Allen was backed by Africa 70 on his 1979 album, “No Accommodation for Lagos,” but he struggled to start his own band in Nigeria. Eventually, after recording in London, he settled in Paris in 1985.
In 1987 he married Sylvie Nicollet. She survives him, as do their three sons and four children from an earlier relationship in Nigeria, along with grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He lived in Courbevoie, a suburb of Paris.
Mr. Allen was frustrated with the first recordings he made in France, on which trendy-minded producers smothered his drumming with electronics. But in the 1990s he forged the blend of Afrobeat and dub electronics that he wanted on “Black Voices,” which featured guest appearances by singers from Parliament-Funkadelic. He found more compatible collaborators in the next decades.
A longtime fan, Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz, appeared on Mr. Allen’s 2002 album, “Home Cooking,” starting a long affiliation. Mr. Allen joined Mr. Albarn in the band the Good, the Bad and the Queen and in a project with Flea, the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ bassist, called Rocket Juice & the Moon. He also made small-group jazz albums and recorded with the reggae guitarist Ernest Ranglin and the techno producer Jeff Mills. This year he completed “Rejoice,” an album featuring the South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela that was begun at sessions in 2010. On Saturday, Gorillaz released a new song with Mr. Allen and the grime rapper Skepta, “How Far?”
“I still challenge myself every time with my playing,” Mr. Allen wrote in his autobiography. “I still want to play something impossible, something that I never played before. That’s what I’m after.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">YoungBoy Never Broke Again’s 38 Baby 2 Album Debuts at No. 1 on Billboard 200 Chart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YoungBoy Never Broke Again has scored his second No. 1 album in six months.
On Sunday (May 3), Billboardunveiled the top 10 of its Billboard 200 album chart, revealing NBA YoungBoy's new 38 Baby 2 album had debuted at the No. 1 spot. The Baton Rouge, La. rapper's latest release moved 67,000 equivalent album units, with 4,000 coming from traditional album sales.
The new album contains 17 songs with only one feature from a recording artist via DaBaby's cameo on the track "Thug of Spades." The accomplishment marks NBA YoungBoy's fourth top 10 release since 2018 including the projects Until Death Call My Name (No. 7), AI YoungBoy 2 (No. 1) and Still Flexin, Still Steppin (No. 2).
Unfortunately, it looks like the sales feat comes as the rapper is preparing to go on a hiatus from music. Right before the release of 38 Baby 2, NBA told fans he would be taking a break following an alarming tweet that had his supporters worried about his well-being. That means his collab project with Boosie BadAzz may be put on hold.
This week, the top 10 of the Billboard 200 chart was once again represented by hip-hop in a major way. Other artists with top 10 finishes include DaBaby (Blame It on Baby, No. 2), Lil Uzi Vert (Eternal Atake, No. 3), The Weeknd (After Hours, No. 4), Lil Baby (My Turn, No. 5), Post Malone (Hollywood's Bleeding, No. 6), Roddy Ricch (Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial, No. 8), Travis Scott (Astroworld, No. 9) and Megan Thee Stallion (Suga, No. 10).

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Baby' One More Time: YoungBoy Never Broke Again's '38 Baby 2' Bounces DaBaby From No. 1 on Billboard 200</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YoungBoy Never Broke Again scores his second No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart, as his latest release, 38 Baby 2, bounds in atop the tally. The set arrives with 67,000 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in the week ending April 30, according to Nielsen Music/MRC Data.
38 Baby 2 is the rapper’s second No. 1, following AI YoungBoy 2, which debuted at No. 1 less than seven months ago with 110,000 units earned in its first week (Oct. 26, 2019-dated chart). Further, 38 Baby 2 replaces another “baby”-named album at No. 1. It bumps DaBaby’s Blame It On Baby down to No. 2, after it opened at the top a week ago. 38 Baby 2 was released on April 24 via Never Broke Again/Atlantic Records.
The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). The new May 9-dated chart (where 38 Baby 2 debuts at No. 1) will be posted in full on Billboard's website on May 5.
38 Baby 2’s bow of 67,000 equivalent album units consists of 63,000 SEA units (equaling 96.9 million on-demand streams of the set’s songs during the tracking week), 4,000 in album sales and a negligible number of TEA units.
Here’s a look at some notable statistics around the debut of 38 Baby 2 at No. 1:
Two No. 1s in Less Than Seven Months:38 Baby 2 debuts at No. 1 only six months and 14 days after YoungBoy’s last No. 1, AI YoungBoy 2, debuted at No. 1 (Oct. 26, 2019 chart). That’s the quickest accumulation of No. 1 albums since BTS nabbed two No. 1s in just three months and six days with Love Yourself: Answer (Sept. 8, 2018) and Love Yourself: Tear (June 2, 2018). In terms of solo artists, YoungBoy’s two No. 1s came faster than any other act since Future had back-to-back No. 1s in two successive weeks with his self-titled album and Hndrxx on March 11 and March 18, 2017.
Three Top-Two Albums in Less Than Seven Months: In between AI YoungBoy 2 and 38 Baby 2, YoungBoy also scored a No. 2-peaking album with Still Flexin, Still Steppin, which debuted at No. 2 on the March 7, 2020, chart. No traditionally credited artist has claimed three top-two charting albums in such a short span (just six months and 14 days) since Miley Cyrus scored a trio of top twos in 2009 in less than six months. That year, in a five-month and nine-day span, she racked up a No. 1 with the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack, a No. 2 set with the Hannah Montana 3 TV soundtrack, and another No. 2 with The Time of Our Lives EP. (Note: The ensemble cast of the Fox TV series Glee logged three top-two albums, all No. 1s, in less than two months in 2010.)
Baby, Baby: For the first time ever, the Nos. 1 and 2 albums on the Billboard 200 have the word baby in their titles, as 38 Baby 2 bumps DaBaby’s Blame It On Baby down to No. 2. Further, it’s the first time an album with “baby” in its title has replaced another at No. 1. And for good measure, 38 Baby 2 is just the fifth No. 1 album with baby in its title. It follows DaBaby’s Blame It On Baby (2020), Hozier’s Wasteland, Baby! (2019), Britney Spears’ …Baby One More Time (1998-1999), and U2’s Achtung Baby (1991).
Lowest Unit Sum for a No. 1 Debut since 2017: It’s a soft week on the Billboard 200, as 38 Baby 2 collects the smallest unit total (67,000) for a No. 1-debuting album since 2017. The last title to start at No. 1 with a smaller sum was NF’s Perception, which launched with 55,000 units on the Oct. 28, 2017-dated list. The last time a No. 1 album had a smaller weekly haul, debut week or not, was when Billie Eilish’s When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? notched its third nonconsecutive week at No. 1 on the list dated June 8, 2019 with 62,000 units.
38 Baby 2 leads a quiet top 10, as it’s the only debut in the region. It’s the first time the top 10 has had less than two new arrivals since the Feb. 8 chart, when no albums debuted in the top 10. That said, there were albums originally slated for release on April 24 that likely would have arrived in the top 10 alongside 38 Baby 2.
Luke Bryan’s Born Here Live Here Die Here and Haim’s Women in Music Pt. III were both scheduled to drop on April 24. The former certainly would have had a solid chance at a chart-topping bow based on the country king’s track record of 10 previous top 10s and four No. 1s. Bryan’s set has been delayed to Aug. 7, while Haim’s album has been moved to Aug. 21, both due to coronavirus concerns. As noted earlier, DaBaby’s Blame It On Baby falls to No. 2 on the new Billboard 200 chart with 56,000 equivalent album units earned (down 55 percent).
A quartet of former No. 1s follows DaBaby, as Lil Uzi Vert’s Eternal Atake is steady at No. 3 (49,000 units; down 10 percent), The Weeknd’s After Hours drops 2-4 (48,000; down 13 percent), Lil Baby’s My Turn is a non-mover at No. 5 (41,000; down 3 percent) and Post Malone’s Hollywood’s Bleeding is stationary at No. 6 (38,000; up 3 percent).
Bad Bunny’s YHLQMDLG holds at No. 7 with 34,000 units (down 5 percent), while Roddy Ricch’s former leader Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial also stays put at No. 8 with 33,000 units (down 3 percent).
Travis Scott’s former No. 1 Astroworld charges back into the top 10, as the set climbs 30-9 with 28,000 units (up 68 percent). The album is basking in the glow of Scott’s Fortnite virtual concert on April 23.
Closing out the new top 10 is Megan Thee Stallion’s Suga, which gallops back to the top 10 with a 21-10 jump (27,000 units; up 39 percent). The set surges thanks in part to less than two days of activity generated by a new remix of the album’s “Savage,” featuring Beyoncé. The redux was released midday on April 29, one day before the chart’s tracking week ended. Watch for further gains for the album next week.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This is not the news anyone wanted to hear, Adam Lambert and Christina Aguilera were set to tour together this summer but have just cancelled the unannounced tour.
Lambert revealed the secret tour on Twitter on Sunday.
“You know what’s funny? There was a whole plan to tour w @xtina this summer around the US. Big venues too! But unfortunately everything went into Lock Down before we were ready to announce. Y’all know I’m an OG Christina Aguilera fan. ❤️ waiting time see if we can reschedule it,” he wrote.
While he does note that he hopes to reschedule the dates, it didn’t stop Twitter from going into full panic mode.
Lambert and Queen also had to postpone their tour dates due to COVID-19.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pre-Coronavirus, Adam Lambert & Christina Aguilera Were Set to Tour Together</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Before the global coronavirus pandemic shut down the concert industry, an Adam Lambert and Christina Aguilera summer tour was in the works.
"There was a whole plan to tour w @xtina this summer around the US. Big venues too!" Lambert, a self-professed "OG Christina Aguilera fan," revealed on Twitter Sunday afternoon (May 3). "But unfortunately everything went into Lock Down before we were ready to announce."
To the relief of fans freaking out in the comments section, he added that they are waiting to see if they'll be able to reschedule those dates.
Lambert dropped the surprising news in response to a tweeted suggestion that the pair live stream together from their homes for a duet of "Just a Fool," the Lotus album track that Aguilera ended up recording with Blake Shelton; before that, Lambert had actually recorded a demo of the track.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lionsgate has put together a new theatrical calendar compensating for the disruption in distribution schedules and production caused by the novel coronavirus. While these are very much still subject to change, it looks like we’ve got some new dates for a lot of interesting stuff.
The biggest is John Wick 4, which is being delayed an entire year. Pushed back from its original May 21, 2021 date, it will now release on May 27, 2022. But something from Lionsgate will be releasing on that date: Chris Rock’s Spiral, the next entry in the Saw franchise.
As for other genre fare, the embattled Chaos Walking starring Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland will keep its current release date, premiering at theatres in our post-apocalyptic future of January 22, 2021. The sci-fi film Voyagers, starring Colin Farrel, Tye Sheridan, and Lily-Rose Depp, will come out November 25, 2020. And The Devil’s Light, a supernatural thriller set to be directed by James Hawes (Black Mirror, Penny Dreadful), will come out January 8, 2021.
As a fan of the ongoing and forever in our hearts Keanussaince, the delay of the next John Wick movie is both the most notable and the most painful item on this list, and I call on Warner Bros. to follow suit by delaying the next Matrix film so that we can continue to have the double Keanu holiday we all deserve and will, frankly, need. 
Editor's Note: This article has the US release date. We will update this article as soon as possible with an Australian release date, if available.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gil Schwartz, aka humorist Stanley Bing, has died at 68</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gil Schwartz, the longtime CBS communications executive who wrote humorous novels and columns under the pen name Stanley Bing, has died. He was 68.
CBS representatives said Sunday that Schwartz died Saturday at his home in Santa Monica, California. His death, they said, was unexpected, but due to natural causes.
Schwartz had a distinguished nearly 40-year career in corporate America with CBS, Viacom and Westinghouse Broadcasting. He retired in 2018 from his post as senior executive vice president and chief communications officer of CBS Corporation.
But unlike most of his peers, Schwartz had a once-secret and then public side career as a lauded humorist and writer of 13 books who satirized the business world he was part of. Under the pseudonym Stanley Bing, Schwartz wrote a column in Esquire for 13 years and then in Fortune. One, “Executive Summary: Stanley Bing,” from 1991, describes an unwelcome 40th birthday in the style of a corporate presentation.

“Bing’s” books included “Crazy Bosses: Spotting Them, Serving Them, Surviving Them,” “You Look Nice Today,” “Lloyd: What Happened,” and “Immortal Life: A Soon to Be True Story.”
Born in New York City in 1951, Schwartz studied theater arts and English at Brandeis University. He was a renaissance man: A poet, playwright, actor, guitarist and photographer of birds, food and travel.
Schwartz is survived by his wife of 14 years, Laura Svienty, two children, two step children and two grandchildren. The statement says a memorial service will take place in the fall. In lieu of flowers, the family requests anyone seeking to honor Schwartz donate to lafoodbank.org, foodbanknyc.org or sfmfoodbank.org.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gil Schwartz, aka humorist Stanley Bing, has died at 68</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES (AP) - Gil Schwartz, the longtime CBS communications executive who wrote humorous novels and columns under the pen name Stanley Bing, has died. He was 68.
CBS representatives said Sunday that Schwartz died Saturday at his home in Santa Monica, California. His death, they said, was unexpected, but due to natural causes.
Schwartz had a distinguished nearly 40-year career in corporate America with CBS, Viacom and Westinghouse Broadcasting. He retired in 2018 from his post as senior executive vice president and chief communications officer of CBS Corporation.
But unlike most of his peers, Schwartz had a once-secret and then public side career as a lauded humorist and writer of 13 books who satirized the business world he was part of. Under the pseudonym Stanley Bing, Schwartz wrote a column in Esquire for 13 years and then in Fortune. One, “Executive Summary: Stanley Bing,” from 1991, describes an unwelcome 40th birthday in the style of a corporate presentation.
“You’ll have to excuse me if I sound a little morose. I am morose,” he wrote. “This corporation recently celebrated its fortieth anniversary of operations. Quite a few parties were held in its honor, and they succeeded in getting this speaker somewhat depressed in the way that only enforced merriment truly can.”
Although he was able to hold the dual identities in secret for a while, in the 1990s, it became “the most poorly held secret in the media business.”
“Bing’s” books included “Crazy Bosses: Spotting Them, Serving Them, Surviving Them,” “You Look Nice Today,” “Lloyd: What Happened,” and “Immortal Life: A Soon to Be True Story.”
Born in New York City in 1951, Schwartz studied theater arts and English at Brandeis University. He was a renaissance man: A poet, playwright, actor, guitarist and photographer of birds, food and travel.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Amanda Lynne
Marli Alexa took to her Instagram account on Saturday night to share yet another steamy photo of herself. The model showed off her enviable curves while enjoying an adult beverage.
In the sexy snap, Marli looked smoking hot as she rocked a black string bikini. The skimpy top tied around her neck and behind her back while showcasing her toned arms and shoulders. The low cut of the garment also flaunted her ample cleavage.
The matching bikini bottoms laced over her curvy hips and accentuated her round booty and killer legs. Her flat tummy and rock hard abs can also be seen in the shot. She accessorized the look with a gold chain and pendant around her neck.
She leaned over a kitchen counter with a drink in her hand. She arched her back and rested both of her arms on the counter top as she gave a seductive stare into the camera.
Marli wore her long, blond hair parted in the center and styled in loose waves. She pinned her bangs back as her locks fell down her back and rippled over her shoulder.
She also opted for a full face of makeup in the pic. The application consisted of thick lashes and black eyeliner. She added pink eye shadow and sculpted brows to further define her features.
She complemented her tanned skin with pink blush on the apples of her cheeks and a shimmering highlighter on her forehead and under eyes. She completed the glam look with dark pink lipstick.
Marli’s 504,000-plus followers went wild for the steamy snap, clicking the like button more than 32,000 times within the first 14 hours after it was published to her account. Fans also flooded the comments section with over 680 messages.
“Super sexy picture and a beautiful woman,” one follower wrote.
“You have amazing eyes and [a] beautiful body,” another stated.
“A beautiful and sexy goddess,” a third social media user gushed.
“Woow you’re an angel, so freackin [sic] gorgeous… I love your eyes,” a fourth comment read.
Marli appears to have no qualms about showing off her petite figure in sexy ensembles for her online photos. She’s often seen rocking scanty bathing suits, tiny shorts, and plunging tops.
As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Marli dropped the jaws of her followers earlier this week when she posed in a neon pink string bikini top that exposed her cleavage. That photo also proved to be popular among fans. To date, the post has raked in more than 25,000 likes and over 400 comments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner Shows Off Toned Abs After Revealing Latest Kylie Skin Drop — See Pic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kylie Jenner, 22, is glammed up in quarantine! The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star flashed her toned abs in her latest Instagram photo posted on Saturday, May 2. Standing by a dark gray door in her swanky new $36.5 Holmby Hills mansion, Kylie gave the camera a seductive look as she lifted her Chrome Hearts hoodie. The black sweatshirt featured a silver cross-emblem at the zipper and a white pattern along the left arm, while the matching pants read “Chrome Hearts” on the left leg. As always, her makeup was flawless with a peach matte lip, hint of a gold eye shadow and black winged eye liner!
Kylie has kept her honey highlights going since social distancing, showing off the pretty hue in with her long side ponytail. “Trolls&chill ?” she captioned the image, adding a white heart. Trolls, of course, is her 2-year-old daughter Stormi‘s favorite movie! The California native showed Stormi watching the newly released sequel Trolls World Tour with Stassie Karanikolaou, 22, at-home and the duo looked like they were having a blast as they jumped up and down in front of the TV! Little Stormi even had the honor of being turned into her very own Trolls character, which Kylie shared to her Instagram just three weeks ago!
The makeup mogul’s latest post comes fresh off the announcement of her latest Kylie Skin drop: an exfoliating sugar lip scrub! “Shhh my newest obsession launches this month,” she wrote over a video posted May 2, showing off the pastel pink box while Victoria Monet‘s “Dive” played in the background. “Yum,” she wrote over another photo, revealing the light, golden brown color of the product along with the mini pink scooper. “Hands down the best duo,” she added over a third image, showing her sold-out Hydrating Lip Mask alongside the brand new scrub!
Kylie’s tanning game has been on point since she began social distancing, spending time at her mom Kris Jenner‘s Palm Springs home before moving into her brand new resort-style mansion! With BFF Stassie by her side, the pair have been soaking up the sun in her pool cabanas in their revealing bikinis. Kylie nearly broke the internet with her super sexy video post that showed her spraying on her Kylie Skin sunscreen oil on April 27, and again her multi-colored two-piece on April 28!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner names daughter Stormi her greatest achievement with adorable poolside snap</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire Kylie Jenner has named what she considers he greatest achievement - her daughter Stormi.
The reality star and makeup mogul shares the two year old with ex and rapper Travis Scott, and paid tribute to her beautiful girl with a cute snap by the pool.
Stormi has a mischievous grin on her face as doting mum Kylie wraps a towel about her head to dry her curls.
"The greatest thing I've ever done," Kylie captioned the snap.
Pals and fans alike were quick to gush over the iconic mother-daughter duo.
Malika Haqq, the best mate of Kylie's sister Khloe Kardashian and fellow mum, wrote: "Stop the cuteness!"
Kylie's bestie Anastasia Karanikolaou commented: "sweeeeeeetest baby girl."
Yris Palmer, meanwhile, just shared a string of heart emojis.
Kylie's had a hell of a year already, not least because she was named by Forbes, at the age of 22, as the world's youngest billionaire for the second year running.
She's had fans tongue-wagging recently with a declaration of love for Stormi's dad Travis - the pair aren't together, but a loving Instagram post for his birthday has some hopeful that a reunion might be on the cards.
"DADA," she wrote, "Happy birthday to daddy of the year!
"I'm slowly but surely starting to accept the fact that Storm is a daddy's girl. But whatever. We went half on greatness!
"The most beautiful, smart, funny and loving little baby. The best gift.
"OK I'm crying. Love you forever! @travisscott."
The pair announced they would be taking a break from their relationship late last year - and while no romantic rekindling has been confirmed, they've successfully co-parented Stormi.

The former Love Island star, 24, took to Instagram to post a picture of himself completely naked on Saturday.
He decided to strip off to honour Naked Gardening Day 2020 and could be seen wearing a pair of gloves and holding a gardening fork.
In the saucy snap he had his back to the camera and flashed his bare bum as he held up the fork in the air.
He was wearing nothing but a pair of black boots and socks as he posed in his driveway.
"HAPPY INTERNATIONAL NAKED GARDENING DAY!" Curtis captioned the post.
His 1.5million Instagram followers were left in stitches by the cheeky snap.
One commented: "You're welcome to come and do my garden any time."
"Only you Curtis!!!! Love it x," another posted.
A third wrote: "I'm in urgent need of a gardener."
"You can be my gardener any day," a fourth said.
Another posted: "Well that's cheered my Saturday up no end!"
It comes after reports that Curtis' TV show The Greatest Dancer has been axed.
The decision comes comes after producers pulled out all the stops with an all star cast for the 2020 series and big name performers that sadly failed to pull in viewers.
A source told The Sun: "Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they've binned it.
"Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rage Against the Machine have cancelled their Electric Picnic appearance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's more bad news for festival-goers today as Electric Picnic headliners Rage Against the Machine have axed their 2020 tour, including their planned appearance at Stradbally.
The band has announced that they are rescheduling their 2020 reunion tour due to the coronavirus pandemic.
They were due to play at the festival in Laois in September.
The said in a statement: "Rage Against the Machine will commence our tour at such a time when we are confident it will be safe for our fans. The rerouted dates (heath and safety permitting) are below and YOUR TICKETS WILL BE HONOURED for the postponed shows.
"During this difficult time, we also respect the fans who want their money back. We've requested and confirmed that, as of this weekend, anyone who wants a refund can begin the process at your point of purchase.
“We sincerely hope that each one of you and your families and friends stay safe and well and that music is bringing you solace and inspiration. We look forward to seeing you."
It's disappointing news for fans, who haven't seen the band play here in over ten years.
We suggest you could find some comfort in this tweet at least...
It is not sure what this development means yet for EP ticket holders - but many expect the event to be cancelled or postponed due to the ongoing crisis.
While the Government's new five-stage exit strategy allows for festivals and gathering from August 10, social distancing must be upheld - which won't exactly be straightforward at a music festival.
Only time will tell.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Electric Picnic headline act postpones entire 2020 tour and offers refunds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An Electric Picnic 2020 headline band has pulled the plug on its tour this year due to Covid-19 and have also offered refunds.
Rage Against the Machine announced that they rescheduled 2020 reunion tour due to the coronavirus pandemic. The band was due to play at the festival in Laois to be held over the first weekend of September.
“Rage Against the Machine will commence our tour at such a time when we are confident it will be safe for our fans. The rerouted dates (heath and safety permitting) are below and YOUR TICKETS WILL BE HONOURED for the postponed shows.
"During this difficult time, we also respect the fans who want their money back. We've requested and confirmed that, as of this weekend, anyone who wants a refund can begin the process at your point of purchase.
“We sincerely hope that each one of you and your families and friends stay safe and well and that music is bringing you solace and inspiration. We look forward to seeing you,” it concluded.
It is not clear how this impacts Electric Picnic tickets.
The band was the first to be announced for this year's event in Stradbally.
The Electric Picnic organisers lodge an application with Laois County Council for a licence in mid-April but the process of considering it has been delayed by the Covid-19 lockdown in Ireland.
Electric Picnic sister festivals in Ireland, Longitude and Kaleidoscope have already been called off.
A Rage Against the Machine handwashing video went viral earlier this year.

A random video posted this year showed a cat trying to escape the jaws of a much bigger dog, so the cat could be seen jumping down from a counter and putting football-like moves on that dog.
Once the cat realize it couldn’t run past it, it suddenly jumped in the air and over the dog like a RB jumping over a defensive back during a game.
Somebody hilariously put Jim Nantz and Tony Romo’s voice to it:

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Whoa.
Visual journalist Matt McKnight got caught up in a “tumbleweed tornado” on a drive near Richland, Washington — but still managed to capture the wacky wonder on video.
The footage was posted on Instagram by the Seattle-based, non-profit news site @Crosscut.
A startled McKnight told the BBC: “Initially I saw like one tumbleweed coming down the road and I was like, ‘Oh that’s pretty cool. Just a tumbling tumbleweed.’ Then I saw a group of them and I had to slow down a bit… I’ve seen plenty of dust devils, but I’ve never seen a dust devil that’s whipped up – I don’t even know how many tumbleweeds that was.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Spoilers: EastEnders star confirms surprise new romance for Whitney?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">EastEnders newcomer Isaac Baptiste has a lot to be angry about in Walford at the moment, having just found out that Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) is his father and he has been lied to.
And actor Stevie Basaula, who plays him, reckons that the anger is ‘totally justified’ when he spoke to Metro.co.uk. But there could be some more fun and enjoyable times on the horizon for him as he has been pondering who a love interest could be for his alter ego.
He told us: ‘Ooh who knows! I hope so. I think it would be interesting to see what his relationships are like with women. Because of the relationship he has with his mum – it will be interesting to see how that will affect any romantic relationships he may have.
‘It would be exciting to have a love interest. Will there be one? I don’t know. I would say Louisa Lytton (Ruby), or we saw him on the boat attempt to make a move on Whitney.
‘It didn’t go well for him but to be fair she did have other things on her mind, so would be interesting to see if anything could come from that situation.’
And viewers will soon see a new side to Isaac as he tutors young Tommy.
Stevie shared: ‘I think we’ve already started to see a different side to him when he’s in the school, he’s more sensitive and much more caring than we’ve seen him before and I think he really can be a good teacher because he’s probably able to understand them a lot better than other people because of his own childhood and the struggles that he faced at school so I think that makes him a really good teacher.’
But he added: ‘Yes there is a lot to unravel about his backstory, I think we’ll get to see why he is the way he is so far.’
Of course, there may be a long wait to find out with production having stopped on EastEnders. But Stevie revealed the cast are all staying in touch.
He smiled: ‘I’ve been speaking to some of the cast. We communicate of a weekly basis. I speak to Zack Morris quite a lot, we’ve become really cool friends and Milly Zero, we live not too far away from each other so we send each other messages. Suzette sends me a message every now and then, it’s really nice to check in on people and for people to check in on me.
‘I try to train when I can in the morning, training is really important to me, I think it just helps to keep me in a good mental space. If I do train in the morning I find that I have a better day. I try and not put too much pressure on myself to be creative, I’m just trying to enjoy.
‘Been binging a lot of TV which is always useful. Just keep taking each day as it comes, going with the flow. Understanding that there is going to be bad days, but understanding what makes the good days good so I can turn the bad ones around.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">I fibbed my way to fame, says star of BBC's Normal People: Paul Mescal - often seen behind the wheel of a car in teenage sex drama - reveals he lied about being able to drive when he got the role</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">He is the breakout star of the BBC’s new teenage sex drama Normal People – but actor Paul Mescal has admitted he only got the part after fibbing to producers.
Although his character, Connell Waldron, is often seen behind the wheel of a car, he kept quiet about the fact he couldn’t drive when he landed the career-making role.
‘My agent was like, “We are not losing this job over you not being able to drive so I’ll tell production that you can and, in the meantime, you go off and rattle through as many lessons as you can,” ’ he told Entertainment Weekly magazine.
The white lie clearly paid off – but it was not the first time that the 24-year-old had been economical with the truth.
He also confessed to fibbing to his drama-school teachers after defying their ban on students playing contact sports in case an injury ruined their acting prospects.
But Mescal, who was 18 at the time, was also a talented Gaelic footballer who played for County Kildare under-21s. He admitted: ‘I wasn’t ready to drop football.’
However, misfortune struck. ‘I went to catch the ball and I got a forearm across the jaw,’ he recalled, describing a brutal clash that left him with a fractured jaw.
 ‘I had to rehearse on the Monday with my jaw shut and I had to tell everyone in college that I had been working in Maxol [a petrol station] and that I had been mugged behind the till. My deep, dark secret was that I was playing football,’ he told the Irishman Abroad podcast.
Despite this, Mescal graduated from the Lir Academy in Dublin three years ago and has already been signed up by the powerful Hollywood agency CAA, whose roster includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. 
In Normal People he plays a working-class student in an intense relationship with the well-heeled Marianne, played by Daisy Edgar-Jones.
Based on Sally Rooney’s 2018 novel, the drama has been praised for its authentic take on sexuality.
But director Lenny Abrahamson said there was less nudity on set than its frequent bedroom scenes might suggest. 
‘Although it all feels continuous to the eye when all put together, the actors will be wearing clothing from sometimes the shoulders down, and when you are [filming] the top and it’s just the torso, the bottoms are completely covered.’
