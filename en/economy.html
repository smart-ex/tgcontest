    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A lot of people find themselves working from home during the novel coronavirus. However, not every job can be done remotely, and the number further varies by country.  
A recent report by Jonathan I. Dingel and Brent Neiman from The University of Chicago analyzed the share of jobs that can be done at home in different countries. This builds off their previous research of which US cities have the highest share of occupations that can be done at home.
To find the percentage of jobs that can be done at home around the world, Dingel and Neiman mapped the Standard Occupational Classification system from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to the International Labour Organization's International Standard Classification of Occupations. The researchers found these two codes didn't always map to one unique code, so they adjusted by a weighted average for each country.
LoadingSomething is loading.
It is important to note their classification of telework jobs was based on their US classification from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET). The researchers wrote "the nature of an occupation likely varies across economies with different income levels."
Their results show that the lower a country's GDP per capita, the lower the share of jobs that can be done at home. The researchers note in the paper this means "developing economies and emerging markets may face an even greater challenge in continuing to work during periods of stringent social distancing."
The following chart shows the share of jobs that can be done in 12 countries with the highest GDP per capita. Of these countries, Luxembourg had the highest share of jobs that can potentially be done at home at 53.4%. That is 11.8 percentage points higher than the share of jobs that can be done at home in the US, 41.6%.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fast-food chains like McDonald's and Taco Bell are betting traumatized Americans will flock to familiarity as restaurants reopen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As states reopen for business during the coronavirus pandemic, fast-food giants are betting Americans seeking comfort will flock to old favorites. 
Executives of chains, including McDonald's, KFC, Taco Bell, and Checkers and Rally's, have all said that customers' desire for normalcy and familiarity will help boost sales as restaurants recover. 
David Gibbs, the CEO of Yum Brands, said on Wednesday that the company's chains — which include Pizza Hut, KFC, and Taco Bell — stand out for their "convenience and normalcy, all of which are highly sought out in these uncertain times and beyond." 
Frances Allen, the CEO of Checkers and Rally's, told Business Insider in a webinar that she expects people are going to want to return to comfort food and comfort brands.
"There is going to be this cocooning going on, a sort of a relief that we survived, but at the same time, wanting to embrace the things that give them comfort," Allen said. "And there's nothing like burgers and fries as comfort food. From a selfish point of view, we're also excited to be able to lean back into that."
McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said on a call with investors on Thursday that familiar brands thrived in grocery stores as people stayed home. Earlier in the week, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company was seeing impressive sales from large brands that customers trust. 
"I think that same dynamic is going to be at play as people start to come out looking for familiar brands," Kempczinski said Thursday. 
Fast-food companies, including McDonald's, Yum Brands, and Restaurant Brands International, that reported earnings this week said that sales are beginning to recover after plummeting in late March. Drive-thru business helped chains outperform the rest of the struggling restaurant business as customers sheltered-in-place across the US.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fast-food chains like McDonald's and Taco Bell are betting traumatized Americans will flock to familiarity as restaurants reopen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As states reopen for business during the coronavirus pandemic, fast-food giants are betting Americans seeking comfort will flock to old favourites.
Executives of chains, including McDonald’s, KFC, Taco Bell, and Checkers and Rally’s, have all said that customers’ desire for normalcy and familiarity will help boost sales as restaurants recover.
David Gibbs, the CEO of Yum Brands, said on Wednesday that the company’s chains – which include Pizza Hut, KFC, and Taco Bell – stand out for their “convenience and normalcy, all of which are highly sought out in these uncertain times and beyond.”
Frances Allen, the CEO of Checkers and Rally’s, told Business Insider in a webinar that she expects people are going to want to return to comfort food and comfort brands.
“There is going to be this cocooning going on, a sort of a relief that we survived, but at the same time, wanting to embrace the things that give them comfort,” Allen said. “And there’s nothing like burgers and fries as comfort food. From a selfish point of view, we’re also excited to be able to lean back into that.”
McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said on a call with investors on Thursday that familiar brands thrived in grocery stores as people stayed home. Earlier in the week, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company was seeing impressive sales from large brands that customers trust.
“I think that same dynamic is going to be at play as people start to come out looking for familiar brands,” Kempczinski said Thursday.
Fast-food companies, including McDonald’s, Yum Brands, and Restaurant Brands International, that reported earnings this week said that sales are beginning to recover after plummeting in late March. Drive-thru business helped chains outperform the rest of the struggling restaurant business as customers sheltered-in-place across the US.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pot Job Seekers Surge as Sector Is Still Hiring: Cannabis Weekly</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unlike many industries, the cannabis sector is still hiring during the pandemic. Yet the number of open positions has dwindled as layoffs become more common and many of the jobs that do exist are temporary.
Vangst, which runs the Gigs site for temporary pot jobs and recently launched a platform for full-time positions, is filling about 600 jobs a week. That’s a slight decrease from pre-Covid 19 levels earlier this year, mostly because companies are employing fewer in-store staff as they switch to delivery or curbside pickup. Meanwhile, the number of job candidates on the platform surged by 300% between March and April, according to Karson Humiston, founder and chief executive officer of Vangst.
“We’ve seen a huge uptick in candidates, and we’re seeing a large number of candidates coming from hospitality and retail,” Humiston said in a phone interview. “When our clients do pick up hiring again, they’re going to have access to a really strong talent pool.”
Of the temporary jobs that are being filled on Vangst’s Gigs platform, about half are replacements for employees who are unable to work and the other half are for normal seasonal work related to harvests or packaging, she said.
The cannabis sector employed 243,700 people at the beginning of 2020, up 15% from the prior year and nearly double the number of jobs in 2017, according to data from cannabis information firm Leafly. However, that number has been shrinking as companies that grew too fast and are now dealing with pandemic-related disruptions cut back.
Canopy Growth Corp. said Wednesday that it’s cutting 200 jobs in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K., about 5% of its total workforce. That’s on top of 500 positions that were eliminated in early March when it closed two facilities in British Columbia.
“When you have the largest cannabis company in the world laying off 700 people, that’s a signal of what’s going on in the broader market,” Humiston said. “We were already seeing that on the full-time side of our business and then Covid-19 came and exacerbated it.”
Not everyone is cutting back, however. Trulieve Cannabis Corp., one of the largest U.S. cannabis companies by market value, has hired around 250 people since the pandemic started and still has about 150 open positions.
The Florida-based company has doubled the number of vehicles in its delivery fleet and saw its call center volume spike from 25,000 calls a week to 65,000 as customers adapted to the new realities of pandemic shopping. It’s been hiring employees for both segments of the business, as well as for its dispensaries, said CEO Kim Rivers.
At first Trulieve was hiring to replace people who had to take time off, but “at this point it really is actual hiring, adding to the workforce,” Rivers said in a phone interview. Despite the pandemic, Trulieve opened a new dispensary in Titusville, Florida on April 18 and plans to open another one in the next week or so.
Rivers said it remains to be seen whether the pandemic-related expansion remains in place once things return to normal, but she’s hopeful Trulieve will be able to keep the employees it’s hired.
“We prefer to not lose folks who have experience within the company, and there may be other roles that folks could shift into as well because we are continuing to grow,” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Adidas is using AI and 3D printing to cope with a plunge in sales during the coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">German sportswear giant Adidas plans to bolster its lagging performance by shifting strategy to focus on its digital platform.The fitness brand reported a 19% sales decline this week as more than 70% of its global stores remained closed during the coronavirus pandemic.
Over an earnings call with company executives, Adidas zeroed in on plans for "digital acceleration" and said it would pivot to a greater focus on its digital presence now that it has limited capacity to operate out of physical stores.
Business Insider got some insights from Adidas into what its revamped digital focus involves: 
Adidas also says it is investing in its digital retail infrastructure, and is reaping the benefits during the coronavirus as its online stores, as well of those of partner retailers, are open all the time. Its physical stores and other sporting-goods retailers remain closed in most parts of the world.
The brand's ecommerce sales saw the highest growth rate on record last year, a jump of 34%. That spurt accelerated even further as sales for ecommerce grew by 35% in currency-neutral terms with 55% growth in March this year.The firm aims to support this trend by connecting experts from its retail teams, mobile-fitness app Runtastic, and the IT team, all working towards building up ecommerce. Adidas is also extending partnership programs with digital pure players — companies that only run virtually — such as Zalando, Asos, Zappos, and Tmall.
 
As well as focusing more heavily on ecommerce, Adidas is also promoting heavily products that are selling well while people are stuck at home. The brand is increasingly promoting products like the Adilette Slides — a favorite among consumers working from home — as they have enjoyed high demand on the brand's channels. Adilette sales went up by a 'triple-digit percentage' rate in April, the company said.
For its sports apps "adidas Running" and "adidas Training", the brand has been offering free premium access since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, hundreds of thousands of athletes have used more than 250 training videos, workouts and training plans to continue keeping fit from home.
Adidas has also focused its marketing investments and efforts towards digital and social media channels and an increase in digital storytelling under the hashtag "#hometeam."
Over the past few weeks, the brand has shared inspiring home stories from the daily lives of numerous brand ambassadors around the world who demonstrate creative ways to "make the most of time at home and, of course, to continue to exercise."

    <h5 class="mb-1">U.S. processes over $500 billion in small business loans to stem coronavirus fallout</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - The United States has made over $500 billion in loans to small businesses hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, and about $145 billion remains in the congressionally approved fund, the U.S. Small Business Administration and Treasury Department said Sunday.
The SBA has processed about 2.2 million loans worth more than $175 billion since Congress last month authorized more funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, part of almost $3 trillion in spending to fight the heavy economic toll of the pandemic, which has thrown about 30 million Americans out of work.
The second round of funding was launched on Monday, allowing lenders to issue forgivable, government-guaranteed loans to small businesses shuttered by the outbreak.
The average loan size in the second round of the PPP loan processing has been $79,000, according to the statement released on Sunday.
The U.S. government’s $660 billion small business rescue program has stumbled on missing paperwork, technology failure, and the misdirection of funds to big corporations. It also faces the hurdle of forgiving those hastily arranged loans.
The latest data released by the government does not address complaints around the transparency of the program. For example, it not include a breakdown of industries that have received loans.
The pandemic, which has killed more than 66,000 people in the United States, has shuttered wide swaths of American life, closing many businesses and schools and leaving hundreds of millions largely sheltering at home. Over the past week some U.S. states have begun to allow some businesses to reopen.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa is hopeful its bailout talks with the German government can be concluded soon, the airline’s board told staff in a letter seen by Reuters, adding that it is also considering alternatives such as creditor protection.
Travel bans have forced the German group to ground 700 of its aircraft, leading to a 99% drop in passenger numbers and causing the group, which includes Swiss and Austrian Airlines, to lose about one million euros ($1.1 million) in liquidity reserves per hour.
“We estimate that these talks can lead to a conclusion soon,” Chief Executive Carsten Spohr and board members wrote in the letter, adding that they are also checking alternative options but do not expect to need them.
“We remain nevertheless convinced that we will not have to fall back on alternatives given the talks with Berlin.”
Lufthansa is negotiating a 10 billion euro bailout that would result in the government taking a 25.1% stake in the airline, weekly paper Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Of that, 5.5 billion euros would be in the form of non-voting capital, for which the government wants a coupon of 9%, the paper said.
A further 3.5 billion euros in loans would be provided by state bank Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KFW), the paper said, adding that Belgium, Austria and Switzerland might contribute towards the bailout.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Lufthansa is negotiating a 9 billion euro bailout, with loans from Austria, Germany and Switzerland, citing a source close to the matter.
The slump in travel due to the coronavirus pandemic has led to a sweeping restructuring of the airline industry, with other carriers also seeking state bailouts.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper at the weekend that “taxpayers can count on us not to conduct these talks naively.”

Travel bans have forced the German group to ground 700 of its aircraft, leading to a 99 per cent drop in passenger numbers and causing the group, which includes Swiss and Austrian Airlines, to lose about €1 million (RM4.7 million) in liquidity reserves per hour.
“We estimate that these talks can lead to a conclusion soon,” Chief Executive Carsten Spohr and board members wrote in the letter, adding that they are also checking alternative options but do not expect to need them.
“We remain nevertheless convinced that we will not have to fall back on alternatives given the talks with Berlin.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hello!
As the curve flattens in many parts of the world and the movement to reopen the economy gains steam, I keep finding myself thinking about this seating plan.
As Holly Secon reported this week, 44% of workers on one floor of a South Korean call center got the coronavirus. The desks colored blue show where employees with confirmed cases sat.
For some of you, that seating plan might look a little like your bank of desks at the office. It certainly looks like mine. 
A number of Business Insider reporters this week delved in to what a return to work might look like, and how offices will have to be reconfigured to make a return possible:
There are other questions beyond whether we'll go back to the office, when, and what it might look like. How will we shop? How will we pay? What felt normal in February — queueing for Chipotle in a packed restaurant and paying by bank card — now feels anachronistic.
Where did it all go wrong for Masayoshi Son?
From Dakin Campbell's story:
In 2017, Son, the founder and CEO of SoftBank, upended the tech establishment with the creation of the $100 billion Vision Fund, the largest venture-capital fund in history. Over the next two years, it would deploy $75 billion across 88 investments, with Son holding an outsized voice on the three-person investment committee. 
Son earned a reputation among some venture capitalists and entrepreneurs who saw him pressuring founders into taking more money than they needed, elbowing aside coinvestors, and warping markets by seemingly pushing for growth at all costs. Venture capitalists kept investing alongside him, and founders took the money as valuations rose. The fund earned some wins, selling a stake in India e-commerce company Flipkart to Walmart and making money on an investment in publicly-traded chipmaker Nvidia. But as more than one company with billions of dollars in Vision Fund cash and no profits began to crater last year, the Silicon Valley community quickly turned against him.
You can read the full story here:
Masa Son is facing one of his biggest challenges yet as the SoftBank Vision Fund racks up billions in losses. 12 insiders reveal where it all went wrong.
Lastly, if you didn't catch the first installment of Starting Up, Business Insider's interview show, you should check out Drake Baer's conversation with Slack cofounder and CTO Cal Henderson.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel Reportedly Finalizing $1B Deal to Buy Israeli Startup Moovit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tech giant Intel Corp. is reportedly in the final stages of a $1 billion deal to acquire Israeli startup Moovit, a company that uses artificial intelligence and big data analytics to track traffic and transit to provide route recommendations to some 800 million consumers around the globe.
A spokesperson from Moovit declined to comment when contacted by Inventiva.
However, sources who spoke with the news outlet said the startup is slated to become part of Intel’s Israeli automotive hub, which is anchored by autonomous driving firm Mobileye.
Intel acquired Mobileye in 2017 for $15.3 billion, the biggest acquisition deal in Israel at the time.
Intel Capital has previously backed Moovit in a strategic investment, according to Inventiva.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TEL AVIV: Chipmaker Intel Corp is in advanced talks to acquire Israeli public transit app developer Moovit for US$1 billion, financial news website Calcalist reported on Sunday (May 3).
Moovit has raised US$133 million from investors including Intel, BMW iVentures and Sequoia Capital.
Officials at Intel Israel and Moovit declined to comment on the report.
Calcalist reported that people with knowledge of the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the deal is very close to being signed.
Moovit’s free mobile navigation app provides transit information to more than 750 million users in 100 countries.
Last month it launched an emergency mobilisation service, which was created for transit agencies and enterprises during the COVID-19 pandemic. The technology transforms vehicle fleets into an on-demand service to get essential employees safely to work and has been implemented in a number of cities by large corporations.
Intel has made significant investments already in Israel, having acquired autonomous vehicle technology provider Mobileye for US$15.3 billion in 2017. In December it bought Israeli artificial intelligence firm Habana Labs for US$2 billion.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel reportedly acquiring smart transit startup Moovit for $1 billion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Intel is reportedly close to acquiring Moovit, which is an Israel-based startup that uses AI and data analytics to track traffic and provide transit insights.
TechCrunch reports that the deal is expected to close in the next few days for around $1 billion USD (about $1.4 billion CAD).
The deal would reportedly combine Moovit into Intel’s Israeli automotive hub and advance its self-driving strategy. Although it’s not clear what Moovit would do in that space, its traffic data and intelligent routing would help advance autonomous vehicles services.
Moovit’s data analytics would be useful for driverless vehicles that need to understand live traffic to determine the more efficient routes.
The company has also reported significant recent growth in the past few years. In 2018, Moovit reported that its apps were used by 120 million people around the world in 2,000 cities and 80 countries. Now in 2020, that number has increased to 800 million people in 3,100 cities in 102 countries.
Nothing has been confirmed about the acquisition yet, but sources say that Intel is expected to make an announcement soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel is reportedly close to buying transit app creator Moovit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Intel’s autonomous driving ambitions may soon get a boost from a well-known app developer. Calcalist, The Marker and TechCrunch sources claim Intel is close to acquiring transit app developer Moovit in a deal that would be worth around $1 billion. The deal would reportedly fold Moovit into Intel’s Israeli automotive hub (currently led by Mobileye) and help with its overall self-driving strategy.
Moovit told TechCrunch it had no comment “at this time.” A deal is supposedly near enough that it could be unveiled within days.
It’s easy to see why Intel would be interested in Moovit, and not just because of existing financial backing. The startup uses a mix of AI and data analytics to monitor real-time traffic and offer transit directions to roughly 800 million people. That could be valuable for robotaxis and other driverless vehicles that need to consider live traffic to choose the fastest routes. If your Intel-powered ride avoids gridlock to reach your destination on time, you’ll know who to thank.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Singapore looks to ramp up factory activities as virus curbs ease</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore will progressively ramp up its manufacturing activities, its minister of trade and industry said on Sunday, with the city-state looking to restart its economy as coronavirus curbs start to ease over the next few weeks.
Sectors that are intertwined with the global supply chain such as biopharmaceutical and petrochemicals as well precision manufacturing will be among priority sectors, Chan Chun Sing told reporters.
Only about 17% of Singapore’s labour force is currently working onsite to maintain essential services and support for global production chains and connectivity.
Chan said workplaces will have put in place prescribed measures to minimise the risk of infection before they can reopen. He added that those who are able to work from home will have to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.    
“So we will not be able to open some of the social entertainment outlets, but we will focus on our manufacturing capacities and production capabilities first,” he said.
The city-state is facing the deepest recession in its 55-year history, compounded by so-called “circuit breaker” restrictions, which are aimed at stemming the spread of the novel coronavirus and are due to last until June 1.
Singapore will start allowing some businesses to reopen from May 12, authorities said on Saturday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Singapore Prepares To Reopen Factories As Coronavirus Restrictions Start To Ease</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rest of the World News
Written By Zaini Majeed | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 14:14 IST
As of May 3, Singapore announced that it will “progressively ramp up” manufacturing activities to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, as the city looks ahead to reopening the economy over the weeks ahead, minister of trade and industry told the press conference.  
Sectors that conduct essential businesses such as biopharmaceutical and petrochemicals, as well as precision manufacturing which are intertwined with the global supply chain, will be on priority to “reopen”, Chan Chun Sing reportedly said. To accelerate the engine of global production and connectivity, at least 17 percent of Singapore's labour force has resumed operations on-site in the factories, as per the media reports. 
Chan reportedly said that several guidelines have been introduced to ensure the health safety of the workers so that they safely resume business. Besides, he added, those who are able to work from the confinements of their homes must continue to do so, according to reports. Further, he added that the city was no position to “reopen” entertainment and social outlets and some public premises, but would instead focus on manufacturing capacities and production to revive the economy in shackles.  
Earlier, Singapore extended the stay-home for the foreign workers, including Indians, in the construction sector by two weeks until May 18 as reports of outbreak emerged among the community. The overseas workers constitute the majority of the 932 new infections reported, as per media reports.

The number of infections in migrant workers surged continuously, and the prevalence remained "noticeably higher" with respect to transmission. Therefore, the "transmission at construction worksites among such workers had occurred before the start of the stay-home notice period," the health ministry said. 
As of May 3, Singapore accounted for 18,205 out of the total 3,497,006 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus worldwide. As many as 17 deaths have been reported so far. However, Singapore would allow some businesses to reopen from May 12 as part of a gradual resumption of economy, as per media reports.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oil up 3% as countries ease lockdowns, production falls</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil was up 3% on Monday as more countries announced they would begin easing coronavirus lockdowns and as crude supply cuts by the world’s top producing nations and companies take hold.
Worldwide fuel demand fell by an estimated 30% in April largely due to stay-at-home orders, and weak consumption is expected to overhang the crude market for months, even as major world oil-producers reduce output as of May 1. However, analysts have said that swift action by those parties could help reduce the supply glut more quickly.
“The market continues to price in the idea that things are improving,” Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
Brent crude LCOc1 settled at $27.20 a barrel, up 76 cents, or 2.9%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 gained 61 cents, or 3.1%, to $20.39 a barrel.
“We’re supposed to see the production cuts start to show up... the slow restart of not only some of the states here in the U.S. but some of the countries in Europe is beginning to partially alleviate some of the demand fears,” McGillian said.
Italy, Finland and several U.S. states were among numerous governments moving to ease lockdown restrictions on Monday to resurrect their economies, but officials cautioned against acting too swiftly as coronavirus cases passed 3.5 million and deaths neared a quarter of a million globally.
In addition to fresh supply cuts that began this month by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, oil and gas output from some of the world’s top oil companies is set to drop in the second quarter of 2020 to levels not seen in at least 17 years.
Goldman Sachs said it is growing more optimistic about the rise of oil prices next year due to lower crude production and a partial recovery in oil demand.
The Wall Street bank raised its 2021 forecast for global benchmark Brent to $55.63 per barrel from $52.50 earlier. The bank hiked its estimate for WTI to $51.38 a barrel from $48.50 previously.
The re-emergence of trade tensions between the United States and China limited the rise in prices.
“Demand growth in China is good for the energy market right now, it is pretty much the only game in town” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho. “Even a verbal scrap with President Trump is not good for China demand growth, considering the fragile circumstances the market is currently operating under.”
Adding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat last week to impose tariffs on China, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday there was “a significant amount of evidence” that the new coronavirus emerged from a Chinese laboratory.
Oil prices recovered some of their losses after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he expected China to make good on its trade agreement with the United States. He also said he expected oil markets to rebound, and that the Trump administration was looking for more storage capacity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oil Falls on Ample Supply as Investors Shun Near-Term Contracts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) -- Oil declined in Asia on signs producers delivered ample supply into the market last month, and as investors continued to cut their exposure to nearer-term contracts.
Futures in New York fell as much as 6.5%, after gaining 17% last week. OPEC+’s pledge to trim supply by 9.7 million barrels a day took effect May 1, but the bloc’s production surged by the most in almost 30 years in April as its biggest members fought to dominate a global market devastated by coronavirus. Russia slightly increased its crude oil and condensate output before the agreed cuts kicked in.
Since crude plunged into negative territory last month, investors have been fleeing the nearest futures contracts, increasing volatility. S&P Global Inc., the company behind the most closely followed commodity index, said it will roll West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures for July into August for its commodity indexes. The United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) LP, which came under pressure from regulators last month due to the size of its WTI position, said on Friday that it will halve holdings in the July contract.
Algerian Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab, who holds OPEC’s rotating presidency, called on members of the cartel to implement more than 100% of their agreed cuts. And in a further sign of producers paring back their output, the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas tumbled almost 20% in April. In the U.S., the oil rig count dropped by 53 to 325, a seventh straight week of declines.
READ: Global Oil Demand Starts a Long, Painful and Uncertain Recovery
Oil futures rallied sharply last week on early signs that demand might be bottoming out, and as U.S. energy majors announced major cutbacks. Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) will slash output by as much as 400,000 barrels a day and Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM). plans to cut rigs in the Permian Basin by 75% by the end of the year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oil prices look for boost as production cuts come into effect</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: Oil markets on Friday closed on their first weekly high in a month, with Brent trading at $26.44 and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) on $19.78, as prices flickered with some good news on Opec+ production cuts of almost 10 million barrels per day (bdp) coming into effect.
“Oil markets recovered strongly last week as Opec+ production cuts began in earnest and more and more countries took steps to reopen their economies. Indeed, oil futures outperformed most other commodities and other risk assets which showed little conviction either to gain or lose,” said Edward Bell, commodity analyst at Emirates NBD.
“In isolation, and at least for the very short-term, conditions are looking better for the oil market than they have in some time. However, oil serves to lubricate the global economy and as economic conditions remain fragile—or worse—in many economies the overwhelming negative fundamentals will still exert substantial downward pressure on prices,” he added.
“The recovery in prices in this past week may be as good as it gets for some time unless there is a dramatic turnaround in economic fundamentals,” he said.
The global imbalance between supply and demand, meanwhile, is also set to halve during May from 26.4 million bpd to 13.6 million bpd according to Rystad Energy, providing oil markets with more good news as storage facilities continue to face the reality of having nowhere left to store oil.
“While this may seem like a drastic improvement from April, the oil market is not magically fixed,” said Rystad Energy oil market analyst Louise Dickson. “The storage issue still looms large and will spill over onto trading floors, as buyers are left with crude they cannot physically cannot place, and into the boardrooms of oil companies which must make very costly but necessary decisions to scale back production and give the market some breathing space,” Dickson added.
“No matter how this physical rebalancing occurs during May, we still expect that the oil price bottom is right in front of us rather than behind us. The next question for markets now is what the recovery will look like and how many oil companies are able to weather the storm and bring inevitable field shut-ins back onstream,” Dickson said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Uranium Markets Are Gaining Interest</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
By Owain Johnson
Uranium futures prices have risen as supply has declined due to COVID-19 concerns.
Demand for uranium remains strong due to its use as a power-generation fuel.
Uranium futures is one of the few contracts that has experienced price gains in recent weeks, as the economic impact of COVID-19 continues to weigh heavily on prices for most commodities.
Front-month uranium futures settlement prices have traded up to $32.50/pound in late April compared with around $24/pound in early March, when most of the world's advanced economies began shutting down.
In contrast to the bull run on uranium, prices for most energy products have sharply declined since the shutdowns began, while prices for industrial metals like copper and steel have also been under pressure amid low end-user demand.
Electricity consumption has held up relatively well in the slowdown caused by the virus. As a key power generation fuel, uranium has been less impacted by the spread of the virus than other commodities that are used more for transport or construction.
Uranium also benefits from a supply-demand balance that is relatively supportive at present. COVID-19 has emerged as a threat to global uranium supply. Indefinite mine closures in Canada, Kazakhstan, Australia and other countries are expected to drive the price of U3O8 uranium higher as utilities fight to secure supply and producers either turn to market purchases or draw down on inventories in order to meet contractual obligations.
On March 23 Cameco (NYSE:CCJ), a Canadian uranium producer, announced that it will be temporarily suspending operations at the Cigar Lake mine, home to the largest high-grade uranium deposit in the world.
Kazatomprom, Kazakhstan's national atomic company and the world's largest uranium producer, announced on April 7 that it will be suspending production nationwide for three months to slow the spread of COVID-19. In 2019, Kazakhstan accounted for 42% of global uranium production. Supply side disruptions caused by mine shutdowns and suspensions are sweeping across the uranium industry and continue to drive a bullish trend.
In the long-term, demand for uranium is growing, particularly from Asia. In April 2020, there were 55 nuclear reactors under construction across the globe, 22% of which are in China. China also plans a further 44 reactors and is considering adding another 168 in the future.
At the same time as demand is increasing, supply has fallen. A run of consistently weaker prices between February 2011 and December 2017 led some operators to close down mines or suspend operations, reducing uranium output around the world.
The lack of correlation between uranium and other energy and metals commodities is also attracting new participants into the uranium futures markets. Fund managers and general investors have noted the recent price activity and are beginning to get involved in uranium futures trading, many for the first time.
At the same time, the relatively volatile nature of uranium prices in recent years has led to a significant upturn in interest in risk management from electricity producers and project developers that are looking to hedge their fuel price exposure. The changing nature of the physical uranium market is ensuring that market participants are increasingly focused on managing price risk.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Indian bank bad debt could double after coronavirus crisis: sources</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MUMBAI/NEW DELHI:  India expects bad debts at its banks could double after the coronavirus crisis brought the economy to a sudden halt, a senior government official and four top bankers told Reuters.
Indian banks are already grappling with 9.35 trillion rupees ($123 billion) of soured loans, which was equivalent to about 9.1% of their total assets at the end of September 2019.
"There is a considered view in the government that bank non-performing assets (NPAs) could double to 18-20% by the end of the fiscal year, as 20-25% of outstanding loans face a risk of default," the official with direct knowledge of the matter said.
A fresh surge in bad debt could hit credit growth and delay India's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
"These are unprecedented times and the way it's going we can expect banks to report double the amount of NPAs from what we've seen in earlier quarters," the finance head of a top public sector bank told Reuters.
The official and bankers declined to be named as they were not officially authorized to discuss the matter with media.
India's finance ministry declined to comment, while the RBI and Indian Banks' Association, the main industry body, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
The Indian economy has ground to a standstill amid a 40-day nationwide lockdown to rein in the spread of coronavirus cases.
The lockdown has now been extended by a further two weeks, but the government has begun to ease some restrictions in districts that are relatively unscathed by the virus.
India has so far recorded nearly 40,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 1,300 deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">8@eight: ASX set to edge lower</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The new month kicked off with volatility on Wall Street as stocks tumbled to close the week. the ASX is set to inch lower this morning, with futures at 8am pointing to a fall of 7 points at the open.
1. May kicks-off with upwell of volatility: The new month has been seized by the bears, with stock markets tumbling on Friday. The headlines of “sell in May and stay away” have been rampant, and perhaps justifiably. The losses for stock markets across the globe were steep, in what was something of a 180-degree change in the market sentiment that defined April’s trading.
It ought to be said, activity was lower than average, and many major stock exchanges were closed throughout Asia and Europe. Nevertheless, for those that were open, it proved bearish day’s trade, with the S&P500 for one, shedding 2.81 per cent, as the VIX leapt back to the 37-mark.
2. Apple and Amazon disappoint the market: One catalyst for the tumble in global equities came as Amazon and Apple disappointed investors with its earnings on Friday morning. Although both companies delivered reasonable financial results for the last quarter, market participants were evidently underwhelmed by their appraisals regarding the future.
Apple refused to deliver any guidance, citing the high degree of uncertainty in doing so. While Amazon flagged that though it expected a boost in top-line growth in the quarter ahead, higher expenses incurred from the fallout from the COVID-19 crisis will impact its future profitability.
3. A better week for US corporates: Apple and Amazon’s results, and the subsequent tumble in tech shares on Wall Street on Friday, belied what was an otherwise better than expected week for both the sector and the S&P500 more broadly from an earnings perspective.
According to data compiled by Fact Set, the information technology sector has generally beaten analyst earnings expectations for the quarter, recording EPS growth of 4.2 per cent, above the 1.3 per cent estimates coming into the reporting period. The strong showing from the IT sector contributed to an improved blended EPS for the S&P500 for Q1, which rose to -13.7 per cent last week.
4. US-China trade tensions reinflame: The other major cause for Friday’s bearishness was of renewed trade tensions between the US and China, as both countries continue their feud about the origins of the COVID-19 crisis, and the culpability for the pandemic.
US President Donald Trump floated the idea of re-introducing tariffs on certain Chinese goods, as punishment for what he says as China’s failure to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. It was also reported on Friday in the financial media that President Trump is considering blocking a US Government investment fund from investing in Chinese equities on Security grounds.
5. ASX200 and AUD tumble: The possible return of a tit-for-tat trade-war pummelled Australian stocks and the AUD on Friday. The ASX200 shed 5.01 per cent to begin the new trading month, with the export sensitive materials and energy sectors pacing the index’s losses. The Australian Dollar also found itself victim to concerns about potential tariffs on the Chinese economy.
Moving somewhat in lock-step with the off-shore Yuan, and as a proxy for the global growth outlook, the AUD/USD plunged 1.44 per cent to close the week’s trade at 0.6418. SPI Futures are pointing to a small drop for the ASX200 this morning.
6. Global growth pulse remains weak: Aside from the deleterious effects of another headwind to global trade, the global growth pulse is showing further signs of weakening. Though it proved a better than estimated result, US ISM Manufacturing data printed at its weakest since the GFC on Friday night.
The US 10 Year Treasury yield remained mired 0.61 per cent, with the US yield curve flattening as a result. The US Dollar traded mixed, up against high beta-currencies and the Pound, but down against the Euro and Yen. And gold also bounced, rallying 0.83 per cent Friday to close trade at $US1700.
7. The week ahead: The data this week will home-in on earnings, central banks and macroeconomic data. Over 55 per cent of companies of the S&P500 have already reported, and although few market-moving names release earnings in the week ahead, market participants continue to track the aggregate earnings growth figure of the companies that are updating the market.
The RBA and Bank of England both meet, and aren’t expected to materially change their policy suite. The RBA also delivers its Statement on Monetary Policy on Friday. And the big macroeconomic event will be US jobs data on Friday, which is forecast to reveal the US unemployment rate jumped to 16 per cent in April.

It ought to be said, activity was lower than average, and many major stock exchanges were closed throughout Asia and Europe. Nevertheless, for those that were open, it proved bearish day’s trade, with the S&P500 for one, shedding 2.81 per cent, as the VIX leapt back to the 37-mark.
2. Apple and Amazon disappoint the market: One catalyst for the tumble in global equities came as Amazon and Apple disappointed investors with its earnings on Friday morning. Although both companies delivered reasonable financial results for the last quarter, market participants were evidently underwhelmed by their appraisals regarding the future.
Apple refused to deliver any guidance, citing the high degree of uncertainty in doing so. While Amazon flagged that though it expected a boost in top-line growth in the quarter ahead, higher expenses incurred from the fallout from the COVID-19 crisis will impact its future profitability.
3. A better week for US corporates: Apple and Amazon’s results, and the subsequent tumble in tech shares on Wall Street on Friday, belied what was an otherwise better than expected week for both the sector and the S&P500 more broadly from an earnings perspective.
According to data compiled by Fact Set, the information technology sector has generally beaten analyst earnings expectations for the quarter, recording EPS growth of 4.2 per cent, above the 1.3 per cent estimates coming into the reporting period. The strong showing from the IT sector contributed to an improved blended EPS for the S&P500 for Q1, which rose to -13.7 per cent last week.
4. US-China trade tensions reinflame: The other major cause for Friday’s bearishness was of renewed trade tensions between the US and China, as both countries continue their feud about the origins of the COVID-19 crisis, and the culpability for the pandemic.
US President Donald Trump floated the idea of re-introducing tariffs on certain Chinese goods, as punishment for what he says as China’s failure to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. It was also reported on Friday in the financial media that President Trump is considering blocking a US Government investment fund from investing in Chinese equities on Security grounds.
5. ASX200 and AUD tumble: The possible return of a tit-for-tat trade-war pummelled Australian stocks and the AUD on Friday. The ASX200 shed 5.01 per cent to begin the new trading month, with the export sensitive materials and energy sectors pacing the index’s losses. The Australian Dollar also found itself victim to concerns about potential tariffs on the Chinese economy.
Moving somewhat in lock-step with the off-shore Yuan, and as a proxy for the global growth outlook, the AUD/USD plunged 1.44 per cent to close the week’s trade at 0.6418. SPI Futures are pointing to a small drop for the ASX200 this morning.
6. Global growth pulse remains weak: Aside from the deleterious effects of another headwind to global trade, the global growth pulse is showing further signs of weakening. Though it proved a better than estimated result, US ISM Manufacturing data printed at its weakest since the GFC on Friday night.
The US 10 Year Treasury yield remained mired 0.61 per cent, with the US yield curve flattening as a result. The US Dollar traded mixed, up against high beta-currencies and the Pound, but down against the Euro and Yen. And gold also bounced, rallying 0.83 per cent Friday to close trade at $US1700.
7. The week ahead: The data this week will home-in on earnings, central banks and macroeconomic data. Over 55 per cent of companies of the S&P500 have already reported, and although few market-moving names release earnings in the week ahead, market participants continue to track the aggregate earnings growth figure of the companies that are updating the market.
The RBA and Bank of England both meet, and aren’t expected to materially change their policy suite. The RBA also delivers its Statement on Monetary Policy on Friday. And the big macroeconomic event will be US jobs data on Friday, which is forecast to reveal the US unemployment rate jumped to 16 per cent in April.
ASX futures down 7 points or 0.1% to 5230

    <h5 class="mb-1">Are investors driven by FOMO, or is a retest of the lows coming? Here’s what Wall Street strategists are saying about the stock-market outlook</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">America is attempting to reopen economies that have been shuttered across the country and Wall Street investors don’t seem to be particularly concerned about how that all shakes out in the weeks, months and years to come.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.55% is up by about 33% since its late-March closing low at 18,591.93, when fears of the economic damage the coronavirus epidemic could do gripped the market, leaving the blue-chip index 18.3% down from its Feb. 12 record closing peak 29,551.42.
The S&P 500 SPX, -2.80% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -3.20% indexes are up 31% and nearly 30%, respectively from their late-March nadir and down 13% and 8% from their respective record highs.
Looked at it another way, the Dow is headed for its best monthly gain, up 12.9%, since October of 2002; the S&P 500 is on pace for its sharpest monthly rally, up 14.1%, since December of 1991; the Nasdaq is on track for its best monthly return, a gain of 15.8%, since April 2009; and the small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT, -3.82% is headed for its best monthly advance since October 2011, with a rise of 18.8%, according to Dow Jones Market Data, as of Tuesday.
Are investors being too dismissive of the challenges of restarting economies that have been rocked by the pandemic that has infected more than 3 million people world-wide and killed 212,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University?
Is it a case of fear of missing out, or FOMO, taking shape?
The Wall Street-appointed Bond King, Jeff Gundlach, on Monday said that he thinks that a retest of the recent lows is plausible.
Check out:This corporate debt fund is the ‘most overvalued asset’ in the bond market, says Gundlach
Here’s how some market participants are thinking about current investment prospects:
“ ‘Our sense is that the liquidity-driven ‘melt-up’ could persist over the near term. Ultimately, however, extremely weak fundamentals should matter. Along this vein, we expect the state reopening process to be much slower than what’s currently baked into stock prices.’ ”
— Wolfe Research analysts
Market participants have attributed much of the recent rally to monetary stimulus and credit guarantees by the Federal Reserve as well as the European Central Bank. The Fed, which has unleashed a barrage of stimulus measures to dampen the economic harm from deadly infection, will release its most recent policy statement on Wednesday. The Fed’s efforts have ballooned its balance sheet to 6.6 trillion, adding 2.2 trillion over the past few weeks as the viral outbreak took hold.
Meanwhile, the ECB will update its policy plans on Thursday.
“The near-term liquidity-driven ‘melt-up’ could persist given that the Fed & ECB are likely to sound equally dovish later this week,” said Wolfe Research analysts including Chris Senyek, Chip Miller and Adam Calingasan, in a Tuesday research report.
“Our sense is that the liquidity-driven ‘melt-up’ could persist over the near term. Ultimately, however, extremely weak fundamentals should matter. Along this vein, we expect the state reopening process to be much slower than what’s currently baked into stock prices.”
“ ‘Literally every single person alive knows how bad earnings / economic data is so that doesn’t “surprise” the market at all. IF the duration of this is shorter than we initially thought that is another reason for the rally.’ ”
— Michael Antonelli, Robert W. Baird & Co.
Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co., says weakness in economic reports — presumably the jobless-claims figures that showed that some 26 million Americans are now unemployed since February — are being shaken off because they were widely accepted due to the stay-at-home procedures in place to limit the spread of the contagion.
“The market cares more about the duration” of this event than the depth, Antonelli told MarketWatch.
Antonelli also said that the megacap companies, which have helped to lead the market higher from its highs, including Facebook FB, -1.19%, Apple AAPL, -1.61%, Amazon AMZN, -7.59%, Netflix NFLX, -1.09% and Google-parent Alphabet GOOG, -2.08%GOOGL, -2.18%, will have to be sold more decisively to drag the stock market to fresh lows.
“The biggest stocks in the S&P500 are a huge weight now and they are all the big tech names, he said. “In order for the market to head lower people will have to start selling the AAPL, MSFT, FB, GOOGL sector because its such a dominant factor now,” the Baird strategist said.
“ ‘While we are not in the clear and many risks still exist, we learn a bit more about our opponent each and every day. As a result, we can better plot our response to it. That is likely being reflected in rising equity prices.’ ”
— Brent Schutte, Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management
Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co., told MarketWatch that the market has staged a cautious ascent despite the risks because it is learning more about the virus.
“While we are not in the clear and many risks still exist,” he said, “we learn a bit more about our opponent each and every day.”
“As a result, we can better plot our response to it. That is likely being reflected in rising equity prices,” Schutte explained.
“For example, cyclical sectors and asset classes have risen over the last few days which shows that the market is anticipating that relatively better economic data may be coming,” he said.
“ ‘There might be a little FOMO in the market right now due to the thought of economies starting to open up again and a resumption of business activity across various U.S. states.’ ”
— Brian Price, Commonwealth Financial Network
Brian Price, head of investment management at Commonwealth Financial Network, suggests that it won’t be smooth sailing for markets from here, given the lack of clear guidance from companies about the future in the aftermath of COVID-19 and increasingly poor economic results.
“Currently, there seems to be a bit of a dichotomy in the reporting of company earnings reports for the first quarter,” he explained to MarketWatch.
“Results for the current quarter were not as bad as some analysts had predicted, which is positive, but the fact that many companies are unwilling to offer guidance for the rest of the year is a negative in my opinion,” he said.
“There might be a little FOMO in the market right now due to the thought of economies starting to open up again and a resumption of business activity across various U.S. states,” Price told MarketWatch in emailed remarks.
“The market appears to be expecting a V-shaped recovery over the past couple of weeks but if the economic data does not validate that assumption then there is a risk that equities will consolidate from these levels,” the Commonwealth Financial manager said.
“ ‘What happens after that is the real question—we will either get significant follow through or a period of activity, but activity which is much lower than what is needed to sustain the rise in prices. I hope for the former, but am planning for the latter just in case.’ ”
— Jamie Cox, Harris Financial Group
Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, says the durability of recent gains will hinge on the success of the reopening of the economy.
“What happens after that is the real question—we will either get significant follow through or a period of activity, but activity which is much lower than what is needed to sustain the rise in prices. I hope for the former, but am planning for the latter just in case,” told MarketWatch via email.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Dow Jones Slid 1,000 Points Over the Past Few Days: Will Bitcoin Follow Suit?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin has seen some incredibly bullish price action throughout the past several days, climbing from lows of $7,700 to highs of $9,500, before declining slightly and stabilizing around $9,000.
The cryptocurrency has been rallying against a backdrop of bearishness within the traditional markets, allowing it to show some tempered signs of breaking the tight correlation that it had previously formed with the equities market.
Analysts are still noting, however, that this correlation persists and that equities could put some serious drag on BTC’s price.
While considering the fresh short-term downtrend that the Dow Jones appears to be falling into, it is possible that this will adversely impact how Bitcoin trends in the days ahead.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) has slid over 1,000 points from its April 29th highs of 24,730 to its current price of 23,720.
This weakness has come about as some major components of the aggregated market begin showing signs of weakness – with Amazon announcing a Q1 2020 earnings miss that sent their stock price reeling down by over 7%.
As more earnings reports are released and as investors begin to see hard data regarding just how devastating the COVID-19 pandemic has been to the economy, it is probable that further downside will ensue.
During the same time, Bitcoin has been able to express signs of intense technical strength, with the crypto currently trading just below its $9,000 resistance as many analysts forecast further upside.
Although the DJI’s recent weakness hasn’t adversely impacted Bitcoin throughout the past couple of days, it could ultimately hamper buyer’s present euphoria in the week ahead.
A recent report from Arcane Research emphasized this possibility, explaining that the price action seen by the S&P 500 and other benchmark indices should be closely watched by Bitcoin investors.

In theory, this correlation could break at any time, however in order for a true decoupling to be confirmed, Bitcoin will have to post a sustained decorrelated trend over a multi-month time frame.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The ACCC is facing a devilishly complex task in forcing Google and Facebook to pay publishers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's new code of conduct designed to bring fairness to the digital advertising marketplace will be world-first. But will it be world-class?
The fight between media companies such as News Corporation and Nine, owner of this newspaper, and Google and Facebook, pits print against digital, regulation against the open internet, market power against political influence, Canberra against California, Walkley Award winning investigations against cat videos.
Our online advertising market is worth about $9 billion a year, and for every $100 spent by advertisers online, excluding classifieds, $47 goes to Google, $24 to Facebook and $29 elsewhere.
But given the intricacies of social media ecosystems, the opacity of digital ad markets, the platform and publishers’ co-dependent but mutually antagonistic embrace, the fact that social media and search engines operate completely different revenue models, attempting to find a way forward will not be easy.
Technically, the purpose of the ACCC code is to correct the "significant imbalance" between the bargaining power of digital platforms and the news media. In internet searches and social media, Google and Facebook are so dominant they are the gateways to the internet, "unavoidable trading partners" for those seeking to do business on the web.
In declaring this the ACCC agrees with the publishers to an extent that has puzzled the web giants. As did the sudden intervention of the government, stung by the closure of local and regional newspapers thanks to the coronavirus advertising collapse. It dumped the voluntary negotiations and demanded a mandatory code. The platforms were blindsided.
The ACCC says there is considerable vital and urgent work to be done. It has to formulate a way to value news content. Good luck. The internet is very good at ranking readership of stories, but if my Big Brother exclusive gets more clicks than your political investigation, it is more valuable, right? And you thought putting a price on carbon was hard.
News Corp is alive to the risks if the publishers don’t adopt a uniform negotiating position and, say, Facebook closes a deal with Guardian Australia, but not News Corp. It wants a provision that bans data collection until all major news publishers have signed up.
The task of designing a mandatory code, with enforcement, penalty and appeal provisions will be very difficult.
Even more difficult: enforcing it.
Litigation at some point appears certain.
Some publishers advocate a licence system, where a designated body collects fees and distributes them to members. But are we ready for a media version of the Australian Wheat Board?
Web giants would prefer a pay-per-click system, used in digital advertising. But publishers would shout blue murder, given platforms use "snippets", preview panes to display content, so readers get the story without leaving the site.
The news industry must fight hard to avoid the experience of musicians, which get a pittance from the platforms. It took the star power of Taylor Swift to win a victory over Apple, which backed down after announcing it would not pay musicians during free the introductory launch of its streaming service.
When Spain forced Google to pay a licence fee for news content, the company shut its local Google News operation down. France is attempting something similar right now.
Let’s be clear. All those who consume the news must pay for it, whether they be digital web giants, or humble newspaper readers.
But the ACCC must ensure its reforms are not just for the big publishers like News and Nine, but also for the 122-year-old Barrier Daily Truth, which stopped publishing two months ago.
It is clear the internet killed print classified revenues just as video killed the radio star. But did those dollars all flow to Facebook and Google or to platforms like Domain and Carsales?
We wish the ACCC luck, but it will be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's new code of conduct designed to bring fairness to the digital advertising marketplace will be world-first. But will it be world-class?
The fight between media companies such as News Corporation and Nine, owner of this newspaper, and Google and Facebook, pits print against digital, regulation against the open internet, market power against political influence, Canberra against California, Walkley Award winning investigations against cat videos.
Our online advertising market is worth about $9 billion a year, and for every $100 spent by advertisers online, excluding classifieds, $47 goes to Google, $24 to Facebook and $29 elsewhere.
But given the intricacies of social media ecosystems, the opacity of digital ad markets, the platform and publishers’ co-dependent but mutually antagonistic embrace, the fact that social media and search engines operate completely different revenue models, attempting to find a way forward will not be easy.
Technically, the purpose of the ACCC code is to correct the "significant imbalance" between the bargaining power of digital platforms and the news media. In internet searches and social media, Google and Facebook are so dominant they are the gateways to the internet, "unavoidable trading partners" for those seeking to do business on the web.
In declaring this the ACCC agrees with the publishers to an extent that has puzzled the web giants. As did the sudden intervention of the government, stung by the closure of local and regional newspapers thanks to the coronavirus advertising collapse. It dumped the voluntary negotiations and demanded a mandatory code. The platforms were blindsided.
The ACCC says there is considerable vital and urgent work to be done. It has to formulate a way to value news content. Good luck. The internet is very good at ranking readership of stories, but if my Big Brother exclusive gets more clicks than your political investigation, it is more valuable, right? And you thought putting a price on carbon was hard.
News Corp is alive to the risks if the publishers don’t adopt a uniform negotiating position and, say, Facebook closes a deal with Guardian Australia, but not News Corp. It wants a provision that bans data collection until all major news publishers have signed up.
The task of designing a mandatory code, with enforcement, penalty and appeal provisions will be very difficult.
Even more difficult: enforcing it.
Litigation at some point appears certain.
Some publishers advocate a licence system, where a designated body collects fees and distributes them to members. But are we ready for a media version of the Australian Wheat Board?
Web giants would prefer a pay-per-click system, used in digital advertising. But publishers would shout blue murder, given platforms use "snippets", preview panes to display content, so readers get the story without leaving the site.
The news industry must fight hard to avoid the experience of musicians, which get a pittance from the platforms. It took the star power of Taylor Swift to win a victory over Apple, which backed down after announcing it would not pay musicians during free the introductory launch of its streaming service.
When Spain forced Google to pay a licence fee for news content, the company shut its local Google News operation down. France is attempting something similar right now.
Let’s be clear. All those who consume the news must pay for it, whether they be digital web giants, or humble newspaper readers.
But the ACCC must ensure its reforms are not just for the big publishers like News and Nine, but also for the 122-year-old Barrier Daily Truth, which stopped publishing two months ago.
It is clear the internet killed print classified revenues just as video killed the radio star. But did those dollars all flow to Facebook and Google or to platforms like Domain and Carsales?
We wish the ACCC luck, but it will be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle.

    <h5 class="mb-1">First the Australian economy needs CPR. We’ll worry about reform later</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I can’t take seriously all those people saying we mustn’t waste a crisis, but seize this great opportunity to introduce sweeping economic reform. It’s like telling a baby who hasn’t yet learnt to walk it should start training for the Olympics.
It’s true, of course, that we won’t get back to economic life as we used to know it – that is, knew it before the global financial crisis, more than a decade ago – until we get back to reasonably strong annual improvement in the productivity of labour.
But the plain fact is, you’ve got to have a functioning economy before you can worry about how fast its productivity is improving. So there’ll be a time to debate which policies would or wouldn't do most to enhance productivity, but we have more pressing matters to attend to.
Some in the don’t-waste-the-crisis party can be forgiven because they’re under 50 and have no memory of what happens in recessions. But as my colleague Shane Wright has said, most of them are "the usual suspects, falling back on their usual agendas".
They have no genuine concern about the economy’s present life-threatened state, but are business people engaged in rent-seeking, or economists running off faith in their economic model, whether or not it’s supported by empirical evidence their theory actually works.
These urgers have forgotten that micro-economic reform seeks to increase economic growth by making the supply (production) side of the economy work more efficiently. It delivers results only over the medium to long term. It’s thus no substitute for macro-economic management, which deals with managing the demand side of the economy in the short term.
Right now, the prospect of a 10 per cent unemployment rate tells us we have more supply than we’re able to use. Clearly, our problem’s that demand is insufficient. The improvement in economic efficiency we assume we could gain by, say, taxing land rather than the transfer of it, is minor compared with the monumental inefficiency we know for certain is occurring because 10 per cent of our workers can’t find work.
Right now, we don’t even have an economy that’s functioning, much less functioning well. Much of it’s closed - locked up by government decree. We’re starting to ease the lockdown, but we won’t be opening our borders for another year or two.
When we do have most of the lockdown removed, what will we see? The economy won’t snap back. Not even bounce back in any significant way. True, once businesses are allowed to reopen they’ll be making some sales rather than next to none. But with so many households unemployed, sales won’t go back to anything like where they were.
Most households and businesses will be in cost-cutting mode. Firms have been incurring overheads while earning little. Even those households still working will be worried about their big mortgages and fearful of losing their own jobs. As Treasury secretary Dr Steven Kennedy has warned, “some jobs and businesses will have been lost permanently”.
Most firms and households will be getting back to some semblance of normality, but few will be doing much that causes the economy to grow in any positive sense. As Reserve Bank governor Dr Philip Lowe has said, firms and households are suffering from a "high level of uncertainty about the future" and will engage in "precautionary behaviour". They’ll be saving not spending.
Sound like a bounce-back, or an economy still in the intensive care unit? Ask yourself this: which are the forces that will propel the economy forward? It won’t be the main factor we’ve relied on in recent years – high immigration. Our population’s now falling, as people on temporary visas are sent home and not replaced. (Not that population growth does anything much to lift income per person.)
It won’t be “external stimulus” because the rest of the world is growing faster than us (it isn’t), or a lower dollar is making our exports cheaper to foreigners because we’ll continue banning foreign tourists and overseas students. Export commodity prices aren’t rising.
It won’t be growth in real wages (employers will compulsively demand a wage freeze) nor a "wealth effect" from rising house prices prompting households to cut their rate of saving. And a key missing piece: it won’t be big cuts in interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending.
That leaves only "fiscal stimulus" – the budget. The huge government spending so far has merely limited the extent of the economy’s fall. Should Scott Morrison soon start winding it back as he says he plans to, we could fall even further.
No, if we're to actually recover what will come next is a lot more government spending, particularly on useful projects. It can only be a government-led recovery.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Berejiklian government is being urged by a lower house committee to report within months how the promotion of low-carbon technologies can help revive NSW's economy as well as reducing its dependence on coal.
The five-member lower house Committee on Environment and Planning - three of whom are Liberal MPs - last week agreed to ask the government for the study of the employment and investment opportunities that can be generated by the renewable energy sector and a shift to a low-carbon economy.
Alex Greenwich, the independent MP who is also chair of the committee, said the workforce and economic opportunities from accelerating the take-up of wind and solar energy would be "critical" for the state's rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Our committee has heard thousands of new jobs are waiting to be created and there has never been a more important time for this," Mr Greenwich said.
The jobs range from construction related to the building of new transmission and storage for the power sector, investment in hydrogen technology, to stepping up energy efficiency in homes and businesses that would have lasting benefits.
"There is a lot NSW can do to future proof our economy by increasing access and supply of renewable energy both locally and for export," he said.
The committee had planned to hold hearings into its energy inquiry by now in places such as the Hunter Valley, before the coronavirus-linked lockdowns delayed the events.
The recent collapse in export thermal coal prices - now trading at about half their levels of two years ago - has only added to the urgency of weaning the region off fossil fuels, Mr Greenwich said.
"What is going to happen to this region when these exports and dependency [on coal] drop off further?" he said. "This has to be an area of priority."
Energy and Environment Minister Matt Kean, who has said he aims to accelerate the roll-out of renewable energy in NSW, said he would respond to the committee's request "shortly".
“I welcome the committee’s support for ensuring a strong and sustainable economic recovery from COVID-19 and their approach to seeking expert input on this matter," Mr Kean said.
The committee members include Liberal MPs, Felicity Wilson, James Griffin and Nathaniel Smith, and Labor's Anoulack Chanthivong.
Rooftop solar energy installations were almost 900 megawatts in the first four months of this year, with new systems in April more than 50 per cent higher than the same month in 2019, Green Energy Markets reported on Friday. The impact on business of the coronavirus, however, will likely show a big fall in solar demand in coming months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">$300m clean energy fund to back fossil-fuel hydrogen projects</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Morrison government has committed $300 million to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and instructed it to invest in new hydrogen energy projects including those powered by fossil fuels.
The move makes clear the government's position on the debate over the potential to develop an emissions-free hydrogen industry powered exclusively by renewable energy.
"Gas and gas transmission networks already play an essential role in energy reliability, but gas has even more potential as a resource to produce and transmit hydrogen," said Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor.
Renewable energy advocates, along with Labor-led governments in Queensland, Western Australia and the ACT, argue fossil-fuelled hydrogen should be barred from public funds, which should flow to “green hydrogen” powered by renewables. State governments contribute to regulation of the energy sector through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG).
But crucially for Mr Taylor, he secured majority support at the November COAG meeting to develop a hydrogen industry under a "technology-neutral" approach including all power source options.
Hydrogen has emerged in recent months as a key element of the Morrison government’s emissions reduction strategy, which Mr Taylor said would be based on a "technology investment road map".
Mr Taylor said his goal was to back projects that could reach a long-term goal of producing hydrogen at $2 a kilogram – the point "where hydrogen becomes competitive with alternative energy sources in large-scale deployment across our energy systems".
The announcement of the Advancing Hydrogen Fund follows a crash in the global oil market crash. The fall has flowed on to lower gas prices, which Mr Taylor said “provides us with an opportunity for strategic economic stimulus”.
The government has estimated an Australian hydrogen industry could create more than 8000 jobs and generate about $11 billion a year in GDP by 2050.
Chief Scientist Alan Finkel has said a domestic hydrogen industry could underpin an energy export boom for Australia, and Australia should develop it using renewables and fossil fuel to avoid the risks associated with reliance on any one fuel source.
"By producing hydrogen from natural gas or coal, using carbon capture and permanent storage, we can add back two more lanes to our energy highway, ensuring we have four primary energy sources to meet the needs of the future – solar, wind, hydrogen from natural gas, and hydrogen from coal," Dr Finkel said.
"Think for a moment of the vast amounts of steel, aluminium and concrete needed to support, build and service solar and wind structures.
"What if there was a resources shortage? It would be prudent, therefore, to safeguard against any potential resource limitations with another energy source."
In time, green hydrogen could take over and drive a net zero emissions global economy, according to Dr Finkel.
The Advancing Hydrogen Fund will provide debt or equity finance to commercial projects requiring $10 million or more in capital, which Clean Energy Finance Corporation chief executive Ian Learmonth said would fill market gaps created by "technology, development or commercial challenges".
Mr Taylor recently announced a $70 million fund for green hydrogen project development through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Santos hopes for Narrabri gas verdict 'no later than August'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Energy giant Santos expects a ruling on its long-delayed Narrabri coal-seam gas project by the end of August after the introduction of new rules allowing public hearings to be held online during the coronavirus crisis.
Santos has been waiting years to be given the go-ahead to develop the Narrabri gas fields in north-west New South Wales, believed to be capable of supplying half the state's gas needs. Its plan has been mired in red tape amid thousands of objections surrounding potential impacts to waterways and farmland, which are now being reviewed.
The NSW planning umpire in March was given 12 weeks to make a determination before the timeline blew out due to coronavirus restrictions. Santos managing director Kevin Gallagher said ensuring the independent umpire could continue evaluating projects was "vitally important" in order to drive new investments, generate jobs and support the country's economic recovery once the worst of the lockdowns had eased.
As the lockdown-driven oil price plunge forces producers to pull back billions of dollars of planned energy projects around the country, Mr Gallagher said the $3 billion Narrabri project could support at least 1300 jobs during development and was now "more important than ever".
"We would expect a decision no later than August now that there are arrangements in place for public hearings," he told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.
"That date is very important to us to allow us to start planning and preparation work, and it's very important for NSW customers too, who are paying more than they need to for gas from other states."
Environmental group Lock The Gate, which opposes the Narrabri project, is urging NSW against allowing digital hearings, warning they may "prevent many people from having their say" due to unreliable access to phone or internet connections in some regional areas and older residents' lack of computer literacy.
"Many people living in north-west NSW will struggle to participate in digital hearings because they live on the wrong side of the digital divide,” said the group's NSW coordinator, Georgina Woods.
The evaluation of the project comes at a difficult time for Santos and other energy producers, as lockdowns cripple economic activity, cause steep oil and gas price falls and force a dramatic pull-back in the industry's investments in new developments.
Santos, however, is pressing ahead with plans for Narrabri, saying it is confident the price turmoil would not endanger the economics of the project, and confirming on Sunday it wanted to invest in the project "as soon as we can".
"Ours is a cyclical business," Mr Gallagher said. "We must not lose sight of the fact that the current low price and market conditions are not permanent."
Because LNG is tied to oil prices, critics of the Narrabri project have called into question whether it will be economically viable, due to the threat of vastly cheaper LNG imports. However, Mr Gallagher said he was "confident Narrabri gas will be cheaper than LNG imports, especially when gas prices are high in Asia".
"Demand, and with it, prices, will ultimately recover," he said. "Therefore, we must continue to focus on how and when we need to develop future gas sources at the lowest possible cost of supply to increase competition."
The push to lift gas supply coming into the southern states has been taking on increasing urgency in recent years as manufacturers have begun blaming a three-fold hike in gas prices as they close their doors, while the federal government has made increasing local gas production a condition for states to receive multibillion-dollar energy funding deals.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Industry super funds to demand answers as ME Bank borrowers fume</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Industry super fund shareholders of boutique lender Members Equity Bank will demand an urgent explanation on Monday following concerning claims of borrowers being cut off from personal funds without their consent or knowledge.
The Age and Sydney Morning Heraldreported on Saturday that Melbourne-based ME Bank, owned by 26 industry superannuation funds, had blindsided customers by removing their access to money in redraw facilities in order to pay down home loans.
Bill Watson, chief executive of the $3 billion industry fund First Super, described the news as "concerning".
"I'll be seeking an explanation from the bank tomorrow," he said on Sunday. "Once we've received an explanation, we will determine what action needs to be taken from there. As a shareholder, clearly we don't want to see consumers disadvantaged."
Gerard Noonan, the chairman of the $6 billion Media Super, said several members of the fund had raised questions about the ME Bank move.
"We're looking into it," Mr Noonan said. "So far it seems like a readjustment of the way the bank has structured its drawdown facilities when customers have used their excess mortgage repayments as a source of back-up source of borrowing."
Home loan redraw facilities allow borrowers who are ahead on their loan repayments to withdraw funds above their minimum repayment amounts if they need to use those funds for any other purpose. On its website, ME Bank promotes its redraw facility as a product that allows customers to make extra mortgage repayments and with the added flexibility of letting clients "redraw money from your loan at any time, for free."
Other industry super fund directors said they had been seeking to speak with ME Bank over the weekend for information about what had occurred. "But I haven't been able to talk to anyone," said one.
A number of customers last week contacted The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald after noticing between 10 and 50 per cent of their redraw funds were absorbed into their home loan without any notification.
In a statement released on Saturday ME Bank acknowledged the changes had caused concern among some customers, "particularly in the current environment". The lender said the changes were designed to prevent customers from overusing their redraw to a point where they risked falling behind on their original repayment schedule.
"This can put customers at risk of not meeting their repayment commitments, potentially leaving them open to financial hardship at the end of the loan term," ME Bank said.
"No money has been removed from customer accounts. The adjustment made is to the amount available for redraw."
ME Bank said staff were contacting affected customers and reviewing their circumstances to determine how they could help with their financial needs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Once we've spent big, structural reform is our next weapon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Morrison government’s economic policy response to the COVID-19 shock has so far been about supporting businesses and workers affected by the downturn.
As the government begins to shift from medical emergency management and job stabilisation to plan jobs recovery, it needs to consider the most effective ways to thaw the economy from the deep freeze – the so-called "hiber-cession". It also faces some binding constraints.
Whatever approach the government takes, it cannot rely on further stimulus through either arm of macroeconomic policy. This is because both monetary and fiscal policy levers have effectively been “spent” in crisis management.
What remains? Essentially, structural reform. That is, improving the mix of taxes and spending along with other market structures in a way that enhances competition and/or productivity. Applied pragmatically and fairly, this can be a no-regrets outcome.
What is needed now are initiatives to shore up private capital expenditure. The idea is to help the economy rebound and recover with vigour.
The backdrop to the COVID-19 shock was a decade-long weakness in business capital expenditure in OECD economies, seemingly due to low expectations of future income growth and over-reliance on unorthodox central bank stimuli. This caused a vicious downward cycle. Low business expenditure reduced trend growth, which further lowered investment.
The superannuation sector is a willing partner to assist government in designing, funding and implementing any economic recovery measures. The federal and state governments could consider drawing upon long‑term equity investors such as super funds to help shape their plans to pull the Australian economy out of the COVID-19 downturn.
There are structural reforms the government could announce with the prospect of cross-party support to create jobs and generate wealth in the Australian economy for years to come.
First, infrastructure. Governments could reach out to institutional investors, presenting them with a shopping list or league table of medium- to high-value project priorities and asking who wants to be the long-term owner. The idea is to tender these out to equity participants and leave them to contract out construction activities. This would leave governments to line up planning approvals. Projects that didn't meet super funds' risk-return profiles could be supported by the public in terms of sharing patronage risk until volumes were established.
Second, tax reform. Economists Ross Garnaut and Craig Emerson remind us of the prevalence of "economic rents" in the Australian economy and the need to replace company taxes and stamp duties with a cash-flow tax and land taxes. Such tax reforms could be achieved on a revenue-neutral basis.
A cash-flow tax allows for the immediate write-off of capital expenditure by business. It forces big foreign tech companies to pay their fair share of tax. It leaves most enterprises non-taxable over time. It would also be a huge spur to institutional investors, such as super funds, to fund greenfield investment and so build the industries of the future.
Third, strategic supply chain investments in each major Australian export commodity would help to target infrastructure and industry policy bottlenecks. These should include logistics, processing and distribution channels with a view to enhancing domestic value-adding.
There are some obvious supply chains within the Australian economy that could and should have been dedicated to high-growth markets in commodities (such as wheat, wool, milk and beef).
We should follow the example of many other smaller nations, such as New Zealand, and purposefully fuse these operations into an internationally competitive conglomerate. Super fund investment across supply chains can help to make this a reality.
Fourth, build to-rent and affordable housing. Governments surely realise that if they are not prepared to deliver affordable housing directly via public balance sheets (i.e. public housing), they must provide equivalent subsidy to private balance sheets, probably via not-for-profit community-housing providers. The simple way to fund this is to limit negative gearing to new homes and provide a tradeable tax credit to long-term equity capital to build housing for the community housing sector.
Fifth, small- and medium-size enterprise lending. It seems there is a genuine market failure limiting capital provision (debt and equity) to SMEs. This is supported by RBA firm-level research, which has quantified this funding gap at about 500 basis points, controlling for all other factors including risk. Anthony Pratt has done much to publicise this matter.
Super funds want to work with banks (and possibly others) to provide longer term debt and equity. Funds could outsource credit "assessment" activities to banks or non-banks and specialist investment managers acting on their behalf or investing in other structures (such as RMBS or ABS securitisation) that provide them with exposure to the small business sector.
Looking at the five proposals, they would barely affect federal or state budgets, but all could significantly and speedily affect business investment by way of the private sector. Also, the cash-flow tax would provide a significant upfront stimulus to the economy when it is needed most.
All these proposals could be implemented quickly with the backing of long‑term equity investors such as super funds, which have deep experience in managing infrastructure and property projects.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lufthansa hopeful on deal for German state aid</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN: Europe's biggest airline group Lufthansa said on Sunday (May 3) it was close to a deal with the German government on state aid to ease the impact of the coronavirus crisis.
The group, which warns it is bleeding cash and might have to declare insolvency, had appeared to be stalled in its bid for up to 10 billion euros (US$11 billion) in aid, according to a report in the weekly Der Spiegel.
But in a note from Lufthansa directors to staff seen by AFP, the company said it has held "intense and constructive exchanges" with the German government on the financial help.
"In our view these discussions could be concluded in the near future," it said.
"Support from the German state constitutes an essential step towards ensuring our future," it said, as Europe begins to ease measures taken to stem the spread of COVID-19.
Like other airlines worldwide, Lufthansa and its subsidiaries that include Swiss and Austrian Airlines have been essentially grounded and face an uncertain future once their operations are fully up and running again.
In April, chief executive Carsten Spohr said the group was carrying fewer than 3,000 passengers daily compared with a pre-pandemic average of around 350,000 a day.
"We are losing about a million euros in liquidity reserves per hour. Day and night. Week by week," Spohr warned.
According to Der Spiegel, the German government is holding out for a stake of just over 25 per cent in the group in exchange for financial aid, which would put Berlin in a position to block strategic decisions by Lufthansa management.
NO BLANK CHEQUES
The Social Democratic Party (SPD), which includes Finance Minister Olaf Scholz among its ranks, has warned Lufthansa it cannot expect a blank cheque from Berlin.
"The state is not some idiot that will just hand over money and have no say after that," SPD leader Carsten Schneider told the daily Die Welt in comments to appear on Monday.
In particular, he ruled out dividend payments to Lufthansa shareholders if the company received state aid.
But Lufthansa directors have warned that without such aid they could declare insolvency to benefit from a grace period during which they could try to sort out the group's finances.
That might mean job cuts, especially given that Spohr has said there are now 10,000 too many workers given the state of Lufthansa's operations.
Around 700 of its roughly 760 aircraft are currently parked at airports and more than 80,000 of its 130,000 staff are on part-time work schemes.
The director's letter to staff nonetheless voiced optimism, saying: "We are still convinced, in light of the talks with Berlin, that we will not have to go with alternative options."
Swiss authorities have already agreed to guarantee loans of up to 1.2 billion euros to Lufthansa, while Austrian Airlines has asked the government in Vienna for 767 million euros in state aid.
The group's supervisory board is to meet on Monday, and hold an online general assembly a day later.

The director's letter to staff nonetheless voiced optimism, saying: "We are still convinced, in light of the talks with Berlin, that we will not have to go with alternative options."
Swiss authorities have already agreed to guarantee loans of up to 1.2 billion euros to Lufthansa, while Austrian Airlines has asked the government in Vienna for 767 million euros in state aid.
The group's supervisory board is to meet on Monday, and hold an online general assembly a day later.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lufthansa hopeful on deal for German state aid</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN, Germany – Europe's biggest airline group Lufthansa said on Sunday, May 3, it was close to a deal with the German government on state aid to ease the impact of the coronavirus crisis.
The group, which warns it is bleeding cash and might have to declare insolvency, had appeared to be stalled in its bid for up to 10 billion euros ($11 billion) in aid, according to a report in the weekly Der Spiegel.
But in a note from Lufthansa directors to staff seen by Agence France-Presse, the company said it has held "intense and constructive exchanges" with the German government on the financial help.
"In our view these discussions could be concluded in the near future," it said.
"Support from the German state constitutes an essential step towards ensuring our future," it said, as Europe begins to ease measures taken to stem the spread of COVID-19.
Like airlines worldwide, Lufthansa and its subsidiaries that include Swiss and Austrian Airlines have been essentially grounded and face an uncertain future once their operations are fully up and running again.
In April, chief executive Carsten Spohr said the group was carrying fewer than 3,000 passengers daily compared with a pre-pandemic average of around 350,000 a day.
"We are losing about a million euros in liquidity reserves per hour. Day and night. Week by week," Spohr said.
According to Der Spiegel, the German government is holding out for a stake of just over 25% in the group in exchange for financial aid, which would put Berlin in a position to block strategic decisions by Lufthansa management.
No blank checks
The Social Democratic Party (SPD), which includes Finance Minister Olaf Scholz among its ranks, has warned Lufthansa it cannot expect a blank check from Berlin.
"The state is not some idiot that will just hand over money and have no say after that," SPD leader Carsten Schneider told the daily Die Welt in comments to appear on Monday, May 4.
In particular, he ruled out dividend payments to Lufthansa shareholders if the company received state aid.
But Lufthansa directors have warned that without such aid they could declare insolvency to benefit from a grace period during which they could try to sort out the group's finances.
That might mean job cuts, especially given that Spohr has said there are now 10,000 too many workers given the state of Lufthansa's operations.
Around 700 of its roughly 760 aircraft are currently parked at airports and more than 80,000 of its 130,000 staff are on part-time work schemes.
The director's letter to staff nonetheless voiced optimism, saying, "We are still convinced, in light of the talks with Berlin, that we will not have to go with alternative options."
Swiss authorities have already agreed to guarantee loans of up to 1.2 billion euros to Lufthansa, while Austrian Airlines has asked the government in Vienna for 767 million euros in state aid.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Post-Brexit trade deal talks with US to begin this week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain will begin the first round of post-Brexit trade deal talks with the US this week as the Government seeks to strike an “ambitious” relationship which “opens up new opportunities” to UK businesses.
International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and US trade representative Robert Lighthizer will launch the negotiations via video conference call because of the Covid-19 crisis.
Around 100 negotiators on each side will take part in the talks, the first round of which are set to last for a fortnight.
Further rounds will take place roughly every six weeks, and will continue to be carried out remotely until it is safe to travel.
“We want to strike an ambitious deal that opens up new opportunities for our businesses, brings in more investment and creates better jobs for people across the whole of the country.
“As we sit down at the negotiating table early next week, be assured that we will drive a hard bargain to secure a deal that benefits individuals and businesses in every region and nation of the UK.”
Talks will be led on the UK side by UK-US chief negotiator Oliver Griffiths, while all UK trade negotiations are being overseen by the Department for International Trade’s chief trade negotiation adviser Crawford Falconer.
It comes after the UK blamed Brussels for having made “limited progress” during the second round of negotiations on a future trade deal between the European Union and UK.
Negotiators have warned their counterparts across the Channel that Britain will “not subordinate” its laws to the EU “in any areas” and called for more flexibility from the bloc in order to strike a deal.
The EU’s negotiation mandate stated that the UK must sign up to some Brussels-set regulations to prevent the bloc being undercut on standards once the transition period ends in December.
Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, last month accused the UK of refusing to commit “seriously” on numerous fundamental points during the talks, which took place via video-conferencing technology because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said: “With the US election now just six months away, we should all be extremely wary of a president who will do anything to stay in the White House, and a Conservative Government that will do anything to help him.
“That is a recipe for a trade deal designed for the benefit of the major corporations behind American industry, farming and healthcare, which will have very real implications on workers’ rights, environmental protections, the food we eat and our beloved NHS.
“If Boris Johnson will not stand up to Donald Trump, then the British Parliament must. This is too important to get wrong.
“Labour will insist that any proposed trade deal is subject to proper scrutiny, and we will not let the interests of the British people be sacrificed to boost the profits of US corporations.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK-US trade talks to begin on Tuesday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The UK will plough ahead with trade talks with the US on Tuesday as both nations insist that the negotiations will not be derailed by the coronavirus pandemic.
A video conference call will be held between Liz Truss, international trade secretary, and Robert Lighthizer, US trade representative.
The first round of negotiations will last for two weeks and will involve 200 officials. Future talks will take place every six weeks, according to officials.
The ability for the UK to strike trade deals with individual countries has always been seen as a major prize by the Eurosceptic politicians who led the campaign to leave the European Union in 2016.
The Department for International Trade has suggested that a successful deal with Washington could eventually boost the UK economy by £15bn a year.
The department says its analysis suggests that an FTA would benefit every region and nation of the UK with the greatest benefits in Scotland, the midlands and north-east.
However, the government has previously said that such a US deal could boost GDP between 0.07 per cent and 0.16 per cent, prompting claims from some trade experts that the net effect would be negligible compared to the loss of trade resulting from leaving the EU’s single market and customs union.
A cross-Whitehall study conducted in 2018 suggested that growth would be reduced by 2 to 8 per cent in the same period as a result of Brexit.
The UK talks will be led by Oliver Griffiths, director of US negotiations at the DIT, and overseen by Crawford Falconer, chief trade negotiation adviser for the department.
Ms Truss said she would “drive a hard bargain” to secure a deal that benefited the UK and help the economy bounce back from the economic challenges posed by Covid-19.
“We want to strike an ambitious deal that opens up new opportunities for our businesses, brings in more investment and creates better jobs for people across the whole of the country,” she said.
Washington is expected to demand a relaxation on some regulations in agribusiness, such as allowing imports of chlorinated chicken, which could prove politically unpalatable. Ms Truss has previously said that maintaining food standards is a “red line” for the UK.
Donald Trump, US president, initially said that access to the National Health Service would be “on the table” during the talks, only to distance himself from those comments a few months later.
In early March, the UK government released its negotiating objectives document in which it said that boosting trade for small and medium companies was a priority.
Although the primary focus is on goods, the UK is hopeful of boosting trade in digital services. The UK also hopes to secure an early deal on financial services and will run talks in parallel on improving ties between the City of London and Wall Street.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fate of AAP delayed by several weeks as potential bidders circle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australian Associated Press has entered detailed discussions with multiple bidders interested in salvaging the newswire and its contacts database Medianet but it will be weeks before its fate is decided.
Chairman Campbell Reid said in a statement that the Board would enter confidential discussions with interested parties over several weeks after it met with consultancy TMT Partners on the weekend to discuss sale proposals.
"The safeguarding of AAP staff entitlements is the first consideration for the AAP board in these discussions and any agreement entered into with a purchaser will oblige the purchaser to honour those entitlements," Mr Reid said. "In the event of there being no sale AAP will honour those entitlements."
AAP's future has been in doubt since February when The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed that AAP's major shareholders Nine Entertainment Co (publisher of this masthead) and News Corp planned to close the 85-year-old organisation to save costs. But the decision, which affects about 600 employees, was put on hold two months ago after AAP received a number of approaches from parties interested in acquiring its operations.
Staff and AAP subscribers have since been waiting on a decision by the Board about a potential sale before they progress with plans for a future without the newswire. AAP subscribers including the ABC, Daily Mail, Private Media, Guardian Australia and Verizon Media have previously discussed pooling resources and forming journalism partnerships that could replace the newswire when it closes in June, but sources said the conversations have not progressed since the sale process began.
AAP chief executive Bruce Davidson confirmed plans to establish a new private business that would include the company's fact-checking division and parts of its editorial services arm Pagemasters before the sale process began. He also held talks with private investors including stockbroker John Murray but all plans are currently on hold.
News Corp Australia is planning to launch its newswire service, which will provide content for mastheads including The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and The Herald Sun and external customers, next month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fate of AAP delayed by several weeks as potential bidders circle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australian Associated Press has entered detailed discussions with multiple bidders interested in salvaging the newswire and its contacts database Medianet but it will be weeks before its fate is decided.
Chairman Campbell Reid said in a statement that the Board would enter confidential discussions with interested parties over several weeks after it met with consultancy TMT Partners on the weekend to discuss sale proposals.
"The safeguarding of AAP staff entitlements is the first consideration for the AAP board in these discussions and any agreement entered into with a purchaser will oblige the purchaser to honour those entitlements," Mr Reid said. "In the event of there being no sale AAP will honour those entitlements."
AAP's future has been in doubt since February when The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed that AAP's major shareholders Nine Entertainment Co (publisher of this masthead) and News Corp planned to close the 85-year-old organisation to save costs. But the decision, which affects about 600 employees, was put on hold two months ago after AAP received a number of approaches from parties interested in acquiring its operations.
Staff and AAP subscribers have since been waiting on a decision by the Board about a potential sale before they progress with plans for a future without the newswire. AAP subscribers including the ABC, Daily Mail, Private Media, Guardian Australia and Verizon Media have previously discussed pooling resources and forming journalism partnerships that could replace the newswire when it closes in June, but sources said the conversations have not progressed since the sale process began.
AAP chief executive Bruce Davidson confirmed plans to establish a new private business that would include the company's fact-checking division and parts of its editorial services arm Pagemasters before the sale process began. He also held talks with private investors including stockbroker John Murray but all plans are currently on hold.
News Corp Australia is planning to launch its newswire service, which will provide content for mastheads including The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and The Herald Sun and external customers, next month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AAP staff wait on board discussions with bidders</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australian Associated Press will have to wait several more weeks before a decision is made on whether the wire service is sold or closed down.
AAP chairman Campbell Reid said the board, made up of News Corp and Nine executives, has entered into "detailed discussions with a number of parties" which had expressed interest in AAP and Medianet.
"These discussions are confidential and are expected to take several weeks," Mr Reid said in a statement.
"The safeguarding of AAP staff entitlements is the first consideration for the AAP board in these discussions and any agreement entered into with a purchaser will oblige the purchaser to honour those entitlements. In the event of there being no sale AAP will honour those entitlements."
The AAP board met over the weekend to discuss proposals which were put forward by Friday's 5pm deadline.
"You should also be aware that even after the board has met, it could still be some time before any announcement is made, depending on the assessment of the bids," AAP chief executive Bruce Davidson said in a staff email on Friday afternoon.
On March 3, AAP announced it would close its doors after 85 years in operation, affecting 180 editorial staff and a total of 500 individual staff members and 100 contractors across its business.
By mid-March, AAP had received several approaches interested in buying the newswire and its other businesses.
AAP had said the decision was made because the newswire service was "no longer viable to continue", and its largest shareholders, News Corp and Nine, decided to pull their support for the organisation to which they contribute a combined more than $10 million per year.
Australian Community Media and Seven West Media both contribute more than $1 million per year. Clients of the service pay much less for access to AAP content.
The Sydney Morning Herald reported that talent manager Glenn Wheatley was one of the interested parties.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The bankers committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria has agreed that plans to lay off staff would be suspended.
This was announced in a statement signed by Isaac Okorafor, CBN director of corporate communications, on Sunday.
A meeting of the bankers committee was reported to have held on Saturday, May 2, to review the effect of the coronavirus on the banking industry.
According to the statement, it was also agreed that banks would need the express approval of the CBN to lay off any staff.
“The committee particularly deliberated on the issue of the operating costs of banks in view of the disruptions emanating from the global economic difficulties,” the statement read.
“In order to help minimize and mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families and livelihoods, no bank in Nigeria shall retrench or lay-off any staff of any cadre (including full-time and part-time).
“To give effect to the above measure, the express approval of the Central Bank of Nigeria shall be required in the event that it becomes absolutely necessary to lay-off any such staff.
“The Central Bank of Nigeria solicits the support of all in our collective effort to weather through the economic challenges occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.”
In a video that went viral on social media, Herbert Wigwe, chief executive officer of Access Bank, had hinted that the bank would have to lay off some staff and implement a salary cut.
Wigwe said he would take a 40 percent salary cut.

    <h5 class="mb-1">No bank in Nigeria shall retrench staff of any cadre – CBN</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THE Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said no bank in Nigeria shall retrench staff irrespective of their  cadre.
The apex bank said in a press release that this is necessary to help mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families and livelihoods.
Earlier, the Managing Director of Access Bank had said in an interview that the bank would lay-off 75 per cent of its workforce which comprises mostly of junior workers.
A special meeting of the bankers’ committee was convened on May 2, by the CBN, to further review the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nigerian banking industry.
According to the apex bank, the committee particularly deliberated on the issue of the operating costs of banks in view of the disruptions emanating from the global economic difficulties.
CBN has, however,  stated in the press release that banks will require its express approval before they can lay-off  staff.
In an interview with The ICIR, Martins Kayode, a financial consultant said, “Some of the banks are scared they would run out of business in no time, so they want to push some workers out to save cost.”
But, according to Price Waterhouse Cooper (PWC), banks can help customers and businesses to pull through the crisis and emerge stronger once the outbreak eventually recedes.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the world into exceptionally difficult and largely uncharted waters, and banks are feeling the strains alongside their clients, their employees and the societies they serve.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kayode Oyero
The Central Bank of Nigeria and the banks in the country have agreed to shelve the planned sack of workers in the banking sector as a result of the pandemic.
This was contained in a statement on Sunday by the apex bank’s Director, Corporate Communications, Isaac Okorafor.
The PUNCH reports that the Presidential Task Force Team on COVID-19 had said last week that banks would be allowed to re-open for commercial operations as the lockdown eases in parts of the country effective Monday, May 4.
Some banks had proposed the idea of downsizing their workforce as they plan to recommence operations, a decision that has met public outcry.
But the apex bank said it convened a meeting with the banks to review the economic impact the proposed action would have on workers and their families, especially at such a difficult time.
It said, “A special meeting of the Bankers’ Committee was convened on May 2, 2020, to further review the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nigerian banking industry. The Committee particularly deliberated on the issue of the operating costs of banks in view of the disruptions emanating from the global economic difficulties and decided as follows:

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CEO salaries increased at the country’s top mutual fund houses during 2019-20 on robust business growth, with HDFC Mutual Fund's Milind Barve being the highest paid executive.
According to an analysis of the data made public by mutual funds, the CEO salary given by the top 12 fund houses in terms of assets under management increased in the range of 2-132 per cent in 2019-20 from the preceding fiscal year. However, CEO remuneration of Aditya Birla Sunlife MF, Nippon India MF and DSP MF dropped by up to 19 per cent during the period under review.
The salaries for chief investment officers also witnessed a rise for most fund houses.
Salary disclosed by the fund houses for 2019-20 was decided in April-May 2019 on the basis of 2018-19 profitability, which was at an all-time high for the industry, according to industry executives. Overall, the past fiscal was a good year for the mutual fund industry barring the month of March, which saw record declines amid the coronavirus pandemic. Barve, chief executive of second-largest fund house HDFC MF, claimed the top slot with a salary pay-out of Rs 7.43 crore for the fiscal. His package climbed by 3 per cent from Rs 7.23 crore in 2018-19.

He had earned a salary of Rs 22 lakh in the preceding fiscal. Ironically, Bhatia is the lowest paid CEO among the top fund houses.
Apart from SBI MF, fund houses like UTI MF and Kotak MF too gave a staggering salary hike to their respective CEOs.
Barve is followed by Nilesh Shah, the top honcho of Kotak MF, who received a pay package of Rs 7.32 crore, 68 per cent higher than Rs 4.35 crore received in the preceding fiscal. ICICI Prudential MF paid Rs 6.98 crore to its MD Nimesh Shah last fiscal, a hike of 12 per cent from Rs 6.25 crore in 2018-19.
Nippon India MF’s CEO Sundeep Sikka got a salary of Rs 6.01 crore, which is a decline of 8 per cent from last fiscal.

UTI MF''s Acting CEO Imtaiyazur Rahman took home a salary of Rs 4.48 crore in the past fiscal, a 97 per cent jump from Rs 2.27 crore paid in 2018-19.
On the other hand, salary of DSP MF''s Kalpen Parekh plunged by 19 per cent to Rs 4.2 crore in 2019-20.
The salary of Sanjay Sapre, president of Franklin Templeton MF, was not available for 2019-20 as the company''s financial year ends in September. Sapre''s salary was Rs 3.50 crore for the year ended September 30, 2019, as compared to Rs 2.99 crore in the previous fiscal.
L&T MF top boss Kailash Kulkarni''s salary rose from Rs 2.41 crore to Rs 2.7 crore in the period under review.
The fund houses started disclosing salaries after Sebi, in April 2017, directed them to disclose annual remuneration of all employees earning Rs 1.02 crore or above within one month of a financial year, starting with 2016-17.
Earlier, remuneration of all employees earning Rs 60 lakh or above in a financial year was required to be disclosed.
This is part of Sebi''s effort to promote transparency in remuneration policies so that executive salary is aligned with the interest of investors. While a few mutual fund houses have complied with Sebi''s directive and disclosed the information, others still have to comply with the rule.
The asset under management of the industry, comprising 44 players, rose to Rs 27 lakh crore at the end of March 31, 2020 from Rs 24.5 crore in March-end 2019 and Rs 23 lakh crore in March-end 2018.Moneycontrol Ready ReckonerNow that payment deadlines have been relaxed due to COVID-19, the Moneycontrol Ready Reckoner will help keep your date with insurance premiums, tax-saving investments and EMIs, among others.Download a copy Not sure which mutual funds to buy?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reliance to produce new gas from D6 by end of June; to cost USD 2.2/unit at current oil prices</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reliance Industries and its partner BP Plc of UK have pushed back the start of production from the second wave of discoveries in their eastern offshore KG-D6 block to end June because of restrictions on the movement of people and material the nationwide lockdown has imposed.
At current Brent oil price of around USD 26 per barrel, the gas from R-Series field in KG-D6 block will cost about USD 2.2 per million British thermal unit -- lower than even the government-mandated rate of USD 2.39 for gas from state-owned ONGC fields.
In an investor presentation post its fourth-quarter earnings, Reliance said it is working on three projects in the KG-D6 block, where production from older fields stopped in February this year.
"First Gas from R-Cluster field expected by June 2020 subject to lifting of lockdown," it said.
Gas production from R-Cluster was to start by mid-May but the coronavirus lockdown has delayed it.
Reliance said it expects to achieve a peak output of around 28 million standard cubic metres per day by FY24 when all three projects are up and running.
Reliance and BP are developing three sets of discoveries in KG-D6 block -- R-Cluster, Satellites, and MJ by 2022.
R-Cluster will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd while Satellites, which are supposed to begin output from mid-2021, would produce a maximum of 7 mmscmd. MJ field will start production in second half of 2022 and will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.
Reliance in November last year auctioned the first set of 5 mmscmd of gas from the newer discoveries in the KG-D6 block by asking bidders to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required.
Sources said Reliance had in November set a floor or minimum quote of 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price -- which meant that bidders had to quote 8.4 per cent or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.
Considering current average Brent price of USD 26 per barrel, the gas will cost around USD 2.2 per mmBtu.
Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.
In the first round of auction in November 2019, Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL bought a majority of volumes on offer. The price at that time came to USD 5.1-5.16 per unit.
But international oil rates have slumped as demand evaporated due to outbreak of coronavirus and lockdowns imposed by countries around the globe.
Essar Steel had picked up 2.25 mmscmd in the country's first transparent and dynamic forward auction that lasted about five-and-half-hours on November 15, 2019, sources said.
Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) picked up 1.2 mmscmd while Adani Group and Mahanagar Gas Ltd bought 0.3 mmscmd, sources said, adding GAIL, acting on behalf of fertiliser companies, bought 0.3 mmscmd of gas.
Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) had bought 0.35 mmscmd and 0.10 mmscmd went to Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd (GSFC)/Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd (GNFC), sources said. In all, 15 customers across sectors such as steel, petrochemicals, city gas, glass and ceramic got gas in the tender, they added.
In the November 15 auction, bidders quoted between 8.5 and 8.6 per cent slope to corner all of the 5 mmscmd supplies available. This translated into a price between USD 5.1 per mmBtu and USD 5.16 per mmBtu at the then prevailing Brent oil price of USD 60 per barrel.
Initially, Reliance had set a floor quote of 9 per cent of dated Brent price, which translated into a gas price of USD 5.4 per mmBtu at USD 60 oil price. But consumers saw this as a very high price considering that imported LNG in the spot market is available at around USD 4 per mmBtu rate currently.
To pacify the consumers, Reliance lowered the floor/minimum quote to 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price.
Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production in September 2008.
While the MA field stopped producing last year, the output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February.
Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production. Reliance is the operator of the block with 66.6 per cent interest while BP holds the remaining stake.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cricket Australia gets $50 million loan as safety cover if India’s tour is cancelled: Report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cricket Australia has secured a loan of $50 million, an upfront payment as part of a larger $200 million credit, which it has sought to cover the losses if India fail to tour the country later this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.
According to a report published in The Sydney Morning Herald, stakeholders have been informed that the loan with the Commonwealth Bank is a “done deal”.
However, it raised fresh questions about the governing body’s decision to stand down 80% of its staff last month due to financial crisis. CA stood down more than 200 staff on 20% pay until the end of June with chief executive Kevin Roberts fearing they might run out of money by August if the drastic cuts were not made.
The decision, which had saved CA about $3 million, is in question now with the governing body securing $50 million loan.
While Roberts, himself, is still earning 80% of his salary, he is set to propose to state associations a 25% reduction in grants from CA, the reports said.
CA is staring at losing a staggering 300 million Australian dollars in the wake of the pandemic and India’s four-Test tour in December-January could provide relief to the struggling body.
Former Test all-rounder Shane Watson, who is the president of Australian Cricketers’ Association Board, will convene a meeting early next week “to formalise a position on the state of the game’s finances”.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MELBOURNE: Cricket Australia has secured a loan of $50 million, an upfront payment as part of a larger $200 million credit, which it has sought to cover the losses if India fail to tour the country later this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to a report published in 'The Sydney Morning Herald', stakeholders have been informed that the loan with the Commonwealth Bank is a "done deal".
However, it raised fresh questions about the governing body's decision to stand down 80 per cent of its staff last month due to financial crisis.
CA stood down more than 200 staff on 20 per cent pay until the end of June with chief executive Kevin Roberts fearing they might run out of money by August if the drastic cuts were not made.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Markets will keenly track trends in COVID-19 cases</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Indian equity markets rallied sharply this week on account of positive global and domestic cues. For the week, Nifty50 and Sensex were up 7.7%/7.6% respectively to close at 9,860/33,718.
The action was largely seen in large caps as Nifty Midcap100/Smallcap100 were up 6.4%/3.0% respectively. Almost all the sectors ended in green with Metals, Financial Services, Banks, IT and Auto gaining in the range of 10-13%. On the other hand, FMCG ended flat while profit booking dragged Pharma sector down by 2%. FIIs also turned net buyers this week having bought equities more than Rs 1,600 crores while DIIs bought more than Rs 2,100 crores.
Investor sentiment was buoyed by reports of a possible breakthrough in testing for a treatment of Covid-19. Early results from Gilead's trial for its drug Remdesivir showed it helped in speed recovery from the illness caused by the coronavirus. Further, the US Fed left interest rates near zero and vowed to continue its support in fighting the economic impact of Covid-19. Also, hopes that gradual lifting of global lockdowns would help start economic recovery further boosted sentiments.
Over the past few weeks, Nifty has moved up sharply by more than 30% from its panic bottom of 7,500 to closer to 10,000 levels. While the momentum may continue in the near term, one should be cautious going ahead as the fundamentals continue to be weak and valuations seem to be expensive at 20x FY20 P/E. Apart from commentaries from Central Bank globally, markets would keenly track earnings, trend in coronavirus cases, oil price and currency movement along with global events and development around the Covid-19 vaccine.
Technically, 9970 would be an immediate hurdle for the Nifty and a sustainable move above the same may pull the index towards 10200 - 10300 levels. On the flipside, downside support is shifting higher to 9700 and then 9400 levels. Traders are advised to trade with positive bias till the time Nifty holds above 9700 zone.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'E-commerce cos geared up for shipping non-essentials but sales may be hit as large mkts in red zone'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">E-commerce companies are geared up to start shipping non-essential items to customers in orange and green zones from Monday, but sales could be impacted as metros and many large cities are in red zones.
Various cities like Bengaluru, Ahmedabad and Pune have been classified under red zones.
According to industry executives, e-commerce companies like Amazon India and Walmart-backed Flipkart have been engaging closely with sellers to help them prepare for starting shipment of non-essential products as the third phase of lockdown comes into effect.
On Friday, the home ministry had announced a two-week extension of lockdown but said there would be certain relaxations for orange and green zones.
Under the latest rules, e-commerce activities in red zones, which cover large cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune and Hyderabad are permitted only for essential goods during the third phase of lockdown that ends on May 17.
A senior industry executive, who did not wish to be named, said states including Karnataka, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh have also notified their guidelines for online commerce platforms that are similar to those issued by the Centre.
The executive said e-commerce companies that follow the marketplace model (like Amazon India, Flipkart and Snapdeal) could face some challenge as many of their sellers are either located or have their warehouses in red zones.
The home ministry guidelines remain unclear on operations of these marketplace sellers of non-essential products, who are in red zones. So, they are dependent on how local authorities issue their guidelines, he said.
E-commerce platforms could also see slow momentum for non-essential products given that metros and cities like Bengaluru, Ahmedabad and Pune continue to be red zones where only essentials are allowed to be delivered.
Industry players as well as several consumer organisations have been requesting the government for expansion of the list of essential products to include items like laptops, mobile phones and chargers as well as summer clothing to ensure people that do not have to step out of their homes amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The addition of these categories will help customers, especially in red zones, to continue work and study from home and practice social distancing.
Another industry executive said e-commerce platforms have been engaging with seller-partners to prepare them for resumption in services.
The seller, if in the orange and green zone, will be able to see the locations they can service, while the customer will see products that can be delivered to them depending on their location, while other items may carry indicators saying the item cannot be delivered.
Srinivas Mothey, senior vice-president at Paytm Mall, said the company has already had discussions with its suppliers, logistics partners, and most importantly, offline shopkeeper base and they are all set to go online.
"We would be going live with key consumer demand categories like consumer electronics, laptops, home and fashion. These verticals and catalogues would be open to our customers besides continuing essentials. We would be taking new orders for non-essentials from Monday, May 4, and deliver in all green and orange zones," he added.
Mothey said most of its sellers in non-essential categories have confirmed their preparedness by updating their inventory and would be starting to go live on May 4 and the rest will follow suit over the coming week as zonal restrictions ease.
"We have extended their processing times to pack and ship products by 2-3 days buffer, relaxed SLAs (service-level agreements), and penalty conditions on order processing temporarily. We are in the process of getting inventory updated and cataloguing their SKUs (stock keeping units) on the platform," he added.
A Snapdeal spokesperson said the company expects 80-90 per cent of its sellers in the non-restricted zones to be live in the coming week, while other sellers remain in readiness to commence operations are assessing the local operating conditions in their areas.
"We are providing active assistance to our sellers to help them resume operations. Apart from sharing and interpreting government advisories, we have engaged entities on the ground that can help guide our sellers in securing the necessary operating permissions," the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson noted that since majority of its orders come from non-metros, tier II and III cities, it expects a large part of the country to be available for deliveries.
Walmart-owned Flipkart had welcomed the Centre's move to allow e-commerce companies to offer non-essential products in orange and green zones and said it is working with lakhs of sellers and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) across India and helping them prepare their businesses resume operations.
An Amazon India spokesperson has said millions of small and medium businesses and traders will be able to jump-start their businesses and livelihoods across their workforce after the relaxations coming in from May 4.
Emphasising that the company will focus on maintaining the "sanctity of the new guidelines around the red zones", Amazon India has also urged the government to consider the positive role e-commerce can play to get customers all priority products they need in the red zones as well to enable a stronger economic support for the small businesses while prioritising safety.
Under the first phase of the nationwide lockdown between March 24 and April 14, the government had only allowed delivery of essential goods through e-commerce platforms. On April 16, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued fresh guidelines for the current lockdown, allowing e-commerce deliveries and movement of trucks, but on April 19, it modified its order to allow online commerce companies to deliver essential items only till May 3.
Interestingly, traders' body CAIT had argued that e-commerce companies were misinterpreting the MHA guidelines of May 1 and "twisting (them) in their favour to misguide the various state governments and authorities and to create unnecessary confusion".

    <h5 class="mb-1">E-commerce firms gearing up for businesses, to make products available</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">E-commerce companies say they are witnessing a steady growth in traffic after the home ministry on Friday extended a national lockdown but allowed the online sales of essential and non-essential products in zones that have almost controlled the coronavirus outbreak.
While there was doubt about the new guidelines announced for e-commerce, government sources clarified Saturday that e-commerce players will be allowed to deliver essentials and non-essential items in designated Orange and Green zones for the next two weeks, the time for which lockdown has been extended.
The Home Ministry's Lockdown 3.0 notification will allow these companies to sell non-essential items such as phones, laptops, electronic devices, apparel and appliances, which comprise most of their sales. The e-commerce platforms would be taking such orders after five weeks of pandemic-related shutdown which hit their sales severely. The rider, however, is that state governments will decide what items will be allowed to be sold.
Walmart-owned Flipkart said it is working with several sellers and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) across India. It further said its seller support team is providing constant online counsel and support to sellers on the platform to help them resume operations over the next couple of days complying with the government directives.

“We welcome the government's efforts in progressively charting out an exit plan from the lockdown and allowing e-commerce to serve consumers in the Orange and Green zones by fulfilling their product needs, in addition to serving essentials (and) grocery in Red zone through a safe supply chain and SOPs (standard operating procedure),” said a Flipkart spokesperson.
As a marketplace e-commerce player, Flipkart said it is their responsibility to enable sellers and the MSME community to bounce back and facilitate economic activity.
Competitor Amazon said the ministry's new notification on the lockdown would help the company serve people safely. “Millions of small and medium businesses and traders will now be able to jumpstart their businesses and livelihoods across their workforce,” said Amazon.
While the company would maintain the sanctity of the new guidelines around the Red Zones, Amazon urged the government to consider the positive role e-commerce can play to get customers all priority products they need in the Red Zones as well enabling stronger economic support for the small businesses while prioritising safety.
Traffic to e-commerce firm Snapdeal’s platform has been growing steadily since Friday night’s MHA announcement. Apparel and household products topped the list for searches and orders placed. “Users are thronging the platform looking to place orders for a wide variety of products for which they have been waiting for a long time,” said Snapdeal.
About 100 per cent of the sellers on Snapdeal are third-party, independent sellers. Most of these are small sellers and MSMEs who also operate in the markets and bazaars of India. The resumption of broader e-commerce will directly and immediately benefit them by enabling them to resume their operations. “We expect 80-90 per cent of our sellers in the non-restricted zones to be live in the coming week,” said a Snapdeal spokesperson. The firm said other sellers remain in readiness and are keen to commence operations - they will be assessing the local operating conditions in their areas and Snapdeal will continue to guide and support them in this regard.
Since a majority of Snapdeal’s orders come from non-metros, tier-2 and tier-3 cities, the firm expects a large part of India to be available for the deliveries. Logistics planning, which is a detailed exercise, will be done continuously as per ground realities. Snapdeal said it will endeavour to move maximum orders to meet the expected surge in demand, but this will be done in a way that prioritises the overall safety of the sellers, delivery partners and buyers.
Snapdeal has continued to accept orders for both essentials and non-essentials during the lockdown period. While the orders for government-defined essentials were shipped out continuously, it will now start to deliver all other orders received by the firm. Delivery of existing orders, including for essentials, will be a priority. Since there is also a large number of previously ordered products to be delivered, the company believes that deliveries may be slower in the beginning and will pick up speed later in the week.

Paytm Mall said it would start operations from Monday in accordance with the new guidelines.
As millions of people are working and studying from home due to the lockdown, customers are searching for work from home essentials such as mobile phone charges, earphones, data cables and extension cords and also fitness essentials on the e-commerce websites. They are also looking for stationery products and personal grooming items.
E-commerce companies were allowed only to sell essential goods like groceries, medical supplies, and baby food since the first lockdown came into effect on March 25. Last month the government gave an indication that it would allow e-commerce delivery of both essentials and non-essentials, but later said only essential items would be allowed to be ordered and delivered, a move that the industry described as a complete u-turn.
The decision marked a big win for small trader bodies, most notably the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which wanted the government to reconsider its earlier decision to allow e-commerce firms to sell non-essential items.
“It is unfortunate that the e-commerce companies have become habitual offenders in misinterpreting MHA guidelines and twisting it in their favour to misguide the various State Governments and authorities and to create unnecessary confusion,” said Praveen Khandelwal, Secretary General, Confederation of All India Traders, on Friday. “There is no mention of allowing e-commerce to deliver non- essentials in Orange or Green Zones,” said Khandelwal.

The Retailers Association of India (RAI) on Saturday said the new notification by the MHA is a good start to getting the economy moving. “We look forward to clarifications from the states and how they would like to adopt these new guidelines. We hope that the government does recognise the safe space that malls provide for shoppers and opens them up in a regulated manner. The retail industry is still awaiting fiscal aid and policy support to allow it to be able to survive this pandemic,” said RAI.

    <h5 class="mb-1">E-commerce firms gearing up to deliver non-essential products in orange and green zones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the Central government announcing new guidelines on lockdown, which has been extended till May 17, e-commerce firms are gearing up to begin deliveries of non-essential products besides essential products in green and orange zones. In red zones, they will continue to deliver essential products only.
Amazon India spokesperson said that the government's decision will enable e-commerce in orange and green zones to serve people safely with products they need and have not been able to access due to the lockdown.
“Millions of small and medium businesses and traders will now be able to jumpstart their businesses and livelihoods across their workforce. Our foremost priority is to ensure the safety of our customers, employees and partners and we will continue to join efforts to fight against the pandemic by serving people in the safety of their homes with products they need and help in social distancing efforts,” the company spokesperson added.
Rajneesh Kumar, SVP & Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Flipkart Group, "We are working with lakhs of sellers & MSMEs across India and helping them prepare their businesses and workforce to make products available for consumers in this time of need as they continue to stay indoors. Our seller support team is providing constant online counsel and support to sellers on our platform to help them resume operations over the next couple of days complying with the government directives."
"We continue to maintain an intense focus on safety and health procedures at our facilities and for our supply chain and delivery staff that will support the safe movement of goods in a sanitized and healthy manner while following robust SOPs ," he added. 
However, consumers in many large urban centres, which fall under the red zone classification, will still not be able to order non-essential products online.
Avneet Singh Marwah, Director & CEO, Super Plastronics Pvt. Ltd said that a large chunk of online sales come from areas which are currently in the red zones. “Time has come that we need to open up the economy, government has not yet announced any package for MSME. This is a question for survival of small enterprises,” he added.
“While we will maintain the sanctity of the new guidelines around the Red Zones, we urge the government to consider the positive role e-commerce can play to get customers all priority products they need in the Red Zones as well, enabling a stronger economic support for the small businesses while prioritising safety,” the spokesperson for Amazon India also said.
Industry sources maintained that there needs to be smooth implementation of these guidelines at the state and local level levels in the green and orange zones.
Srinivas Mothey, Senior Vice President, Paytm Mall said this decision will bring major relief for consumers who are running low on supplies of several products such as accessories, computer hardware, books, stationery, and even basic summer wear.
“Many have been eagerly waiting for some relief in lockdown guidelines to buy air conditioners, refrigerators to beat the growing heat. This move will give a major relief to citizens and compliment the stupendous efforts the government has made to combat COVID-19. Paytm Mall's offline merchant and shopkeeper base will now be able to get back to running their businesses and safely sell to their customers maintaining lockdown and social distancing norms," he added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lauding the government's decision to partially allow sale of non-essentials, the e-tailers said the move will help meet consumer demand while easing the burden of piled up inventory of the MSMEs amid the extended nationwide lockdown
In a major relief to Indian e-commerce firms such as Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal, the government has allowed the players to deliver both essential and non-essential items across green and orange zones during the third phase of the lockdown, beginning May 4. The e-tailers, however, are allowed to deliver only essential items, which include grocery, hygiene products, and medicines, in red zones.
"Ecommerce activities will be permitted only for essential goods outside containment areas in red zones," the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said in revised guidelines issued on Friday.
Lauding the government's decision to partially allow sale of non-essentials, the e-tailers said the move will help meet consumer demand while easing the burden of piled up inventory of the MSMEs amid the extended nationwide lockdown. They have promised delivery of products with proper precautions and in a safe manner, ensuring social distancing.
Amazon reportedly said that this will allow millions of small-and-medium businesses and traders to jumpstart their operations and livelihoods across their workforce.

"We welcome MHA's announcement that paves the way for a calibrated resumption of various economic activities, including e-commerce, in various parts of the country. This will help start a gradual process of economic recovery by enabling lakhs of sellers and MSMEs to cater to the demand of users through online and offline channels," a Snapdeal spokesperson reportedly said.

This move will give a major relief to citizens and compliment the stupendous efforts the government has made to combat Covid-19 and keep Indians safe," he added.
On Friday evening, the Ministry of Home Affairs announced that the nationwide lockdown would be extended by other two weeks with effect from May 4, 2020. However, the government issued  relaxations in the districts falling in the green and orange zones. All the 733 districts across the country have been divided into three zones - red (hotspots), orange (having a limited number of COVID-19 cases) and green (no cases).

The spokesperson added that as a marketplace e-commerce player, it believes it is the company's responsibility to enable sellers and the MSME community to bounce back and facilitate economic activity.
"We're fully aware that e-commerce can further strengthen 'social distancing' by safe, contactless deliveries through a sanitized supply chain and help governments at the Centre and states fight this battle effectively.
"We are working with lakhs of sellers and MSMEs across India and helping them prepare their businesses and workforce to make products available for consumers in this time of need," the spokesperson said.
Flipkart's seller support team is providing constant online counsel and support to sellers on its platform to help them resume operations over the next couple of days complying with the government directives, the spokesperson said.

"Since there is also a large number of previously ordered products to be delivered, we believe that deliveries may be slower in the beginning and will pick up speed later in the week. Snapdeal's logistics are handled by leading third-party logistics partners.
"We have shared visibility of the expected order volumes with our partners and they are planning their resources to meet the demand in a safe and timely manner," the spokesperson said.
On Friday, the Union health ministry had listed 130 districts in the country in red zone, 284 in orange zone and 319 in green zone.
This classification of districts is to be followed by states and Union territories till May 10 and then will be revised on a weekly basis or earlier if required.
Major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Pune, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad have been designated as red zones in the new classification.
Districts that are neither defined as a red or green zone, would be considered as an orange zone.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Copper giant Peru to gradually ease restrictions on mining sector in May</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LIMA — Peru will gradually ease restrictions on key sectors including mining and construction in May, the government said in a decree on Sunday, after activity had been virtually paralyzed since mid-March by the coronavirus pandemic and a nationwide lockdown.
In the decree published in the official newspaper El Peruano, the government said the exploitation, storage and transportation of large-scale mining could be restarted, as well as key construction projects, some related to hydrocarbons.
Peru is the world’s second largest producer of copper and is heavily dependent on the sector for economic growth.
The decree said that to restart activities, companies must implement rigorous health protocols to avoid infections. These will be set by local governments within the next five days and will be supervised by health authorities.
The country’s mining sector and wider economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, which has seen 42,534 confirmed cases of the virus in the country – the second most in Latin America. The death toll from the disease in Peru is now around 1,200.
“It is necessary to begin the social and economic recovery,” the government said in the decree.
“Therefore, it is a priority to address the transition to a resumption of activities that incorporates precautions and protective measures to prevent infections and minimize the risk of a rebound in the disease.”
Major local mine Antamina, controlled by global firms BHP Group Ltd and Glencore, reported over the last week that some 210 company workers had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, of which 87% were asymptomatic.
The government of President Martín Vizcarra had previously said it would restart key activities in four phases starting this month, but without specifying which sectors.
The supreme decree on Sunday also included resumptions of production in the agricultural industry, industrial fishing, some areas of construction and the metal-mechanical sector.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Copper giant Peru to gradually ease restrictions on mining sector in May</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Peru will gradually ease restrictions on key sectors including mining and construction in May, the government said in a decree on Sunday, after activity had been virtually paralyzed since mid-March by the coronavirus pandemic and a nationwide lockdown.
In the decree published in the official newspaper El Peruano, the government said the exploitation, storage and transportation of large-scale mining could be restarted, as well as key construction projects, some related to hydrocarbons.
Peru is the world’s second largest producer of copper and is heavily dependent on the sector for economic growth.
The decree said that to restart activities, companies must implement rigorous health protocols to avoid infections. These will be set by local governments within the next five days and will be supervised by health authorities.
The country’s mining sector and wider economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, which has seen 42,534 confirmed cases of the virus in the country – the second most in Latin America. The death toll from the disease in Peru is now around 1,200.
“It is necessary to begin the social and economic recovery,” the government said in the decree.
“Therefore, it is a priority to address the transition to a resumption of activities that incorporates precautions and protective measures to prevent infections and minimize the risk of a rebound in the disease.”
Major local mine Antamina, controlled by global firms BHP Group Ltd and Glencore, reported over the last week that some 210 company workers had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, of which 87% were asymptomatic.
The government of President Martín Vizcarra had previously said it would restart key activities in four phases starting this month, but without specifying which sectors.
The supreme decree on Sunday also included resumptions of production in the agricultural industry, industrial fishing, some areas of construction and the metal-mechanical sector.

At this hour, the industry awaits a stimulus package for economic revival and livelihood sustenance besides a calibrated exit from lockdown.”The survey results reveal that the country may experience a protracted slowdown in economic activity, as 45 per cent of the CEOs polled feel it will take over a year to achieve economic normalcy once the lockdown ends.On the job and livelihoods front, more than half of the firms foresee job losses in their respective sectors after the lockdown.A significant share of respondents (45 per cent) expect 15 per cent to 30 per cent cut in jobs.However, nearly two-thirds of the respondents reported that they have not experienced a salary/wage cut in their firms so far.With respect to their own companies, however, the respondents anticipate a slightly quicker recovery within 6-12 months with 34 per cent of the respondents indicating the same.Further, a major proportion of the respondents anticipate normalcy in domestic demand conditions within 6-12 months, post lockdown.For the full financial year 2020-21, the expectations of a fall in revenue are staggered, with 33 per cent of the firms anticipating a revenue fall of more than 40 per cent, closely followed by 32 per cent of firms expecting a revenue contraction ranging between 20 per cent to 40 per cent.While three out of four firms have identified that a ‘complete shutdown of operations’ was a major constraint being faced by business, more than half of them have also indicated ‘lack of demand for products’ as a hindrance to business activity.The survey also points out that according to a large proportion of the firms, a recovery in domestic demand, for their product or services, may precede the recovery in foreign demand for the same.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Three out of four firms have identified 'complete shutdown of operations' as a major constraint being faced by businesses, whereas more than half of them have indicated 'lack of demand for products' as a hindrance
The country-wide lockdown imposed on March 23, while necessary, has had deep ramifications on economic activity.
A CII CEOs Snap Poll on Impact of COVID-19 on Economy and Industry has found that Indian industry not only anticipates a significant decline in their topline, but also fears that economic revival and demand recovery may take more than a year. The survey saw participation from more than 300 CEOs, of which nearly two-thirds belonged to MSMEs.
Majority of the respondents (65 per cent) expect revenues to fall more than 40 per cent in the current quarter (April-June 2020). For financial year 2020-21, the expectations of a fall in revenue are staggered, with 33 per cent of the firms anticipating a revenue fall of more than 40 per cent, closely followed by 32 per cent of firms expecting a revenue contraction ranging between 20 per cent to 40 per cent.

A similar snap poll conducted a month ago by CII had found significant majority of firms expecting revenues to fall more than 10 per cent.
While three out of four firms have identified 'complete shutdown of operations' as a major constraint being faced by businesses, more than half of them have also indicated 'lack of demand for products' as a hindrance to business activity.
The survey results also suggest the possibility of a protracted slowdown in economic activity. Forty five per cent of the respondents say it will take more than a year to achieve economic normalcy once the lockdown ends. However, with respect to their own companies, 34 per cent of the respondents anticipate a slightly quicker recovery, i.e. within 6-12 months. The CEOs also say the recovery in domestic demand, for their product or services, may precede the recovery in foreign demand for the same.

On the jobs and livelihoods front, more than half of the firms (54 per cent) foresee job losses in their respective sectors after the lockdown ends. A major share of respondents (45 per cent) expect 15 per cent to 30 per cent cut in jobs. However, nearly two-thirds of the respondents reported that they have not carried out a salary/wage cut in their firms so far.
Taking cognisance of the deteriorating industry expectations, Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII, called for a stimulus package for the industry. "While the lockdown was necessary to mitigate the impact coronavirus has on the population, it has had dire implications for economic activity. At this hour, the industry awaits a stimulus package for economic revival and livelihood sustenance besides calibrated exit from lockdown," he states.

Continuing their selling spree for the second straight month, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) withdrew a net Rs 15,403 crore from the Indian capital markets in April amid the coronavirus crisis.  As per the depositories data, FPIs pulled out a net sum of Rs 6,884 crore from equities and a net Rs 8,519 crore from the debt segment between April 1-30.  The total net outflow during the month stood at Rs 15,403 crore.
In March, FPIs had withdrawn a record Rs 1.1 lakh crore on a net basis from the Indian capital markets (both equity and debt).  "Of the inflows that are coming into India, nearly all are in the NBFC and pharma sectors," said Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO at Groww.
He further said outflows have continued due to uncertainty surrounding economic conditions and investors are being cautious, keeping their reserves in the US dollar.  "Though net outflow continued in April, it did not reach the levels seen in March.

"So far, India has been able to contain the COVID-19 pandemic from spreading aggressively. In addition to that, measures announced by the government and the RBI periodically to revitalize the sagging economy would have also resonated well with investors," said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research, Morningstar India.
With selective relaxation in the lockdown and gradual opening up of economic activity in the country, foreign investors will be closely watching the developments on this front. They would also start looking at the domestic economic indicators as well to see how the country manages its deficits, he added.
"These are unprecedented scenarios; and with risk-taking going off the table, emerging markets like India may continue to witness similar trends for a prolonged period or until the time situation on the coronavirus front stabilizes," Srivastava said.FPIs remain in sell-off mode, pull out Rs 15,403 crore in April

    <h5 class="mb-1">FPIs pause selloff mode, outflow drops 88% in April</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a big relief to the capital markets, even as the coronaviruspandemic continues to hit economies and markets worldwide, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) significantly reduced the pace of outflows in April, after a record net outflow of Rs 1,18,203 crore in March 2020. In April, FPIs pulled out a net of Rs 14,858 crore from equity and debt markets.
According to data sourced from CDSL, FPIs sold a net of Rs 6,883 crore from the equities market in April and sold net holdings worth Rs 12,551 crore from the debt market.
They were, however, net positive investors in debt voluntary retention route (VRR) scheme that allows FPIs to participate in repos and also invest in exchange traded funds that invest in debt instruments. They invested a net of Rs 4,032 crore in debt VRR schemes in April.
The VRR channel is aimed at attracting long-term and stable FPI investments into debt markets, while providing FPIs with operational flexibility to manage their investments.
While net fund outflow of Rs 14,858 crore from capital markets in April is a significant amount, it is one-eighth of outflows seen in March when the pandemic started spreading in India and the Prime Minister announced a 21-day lockdown on March 24.
The outflow from the equity markets reduced from Rs 61,972 crore in March to Rs 6,883 crore in April. The sharp decline in outflow brought relief for equity markets and they staged a smart recovery, in line with other global markets. After witnessing a sharp fall of 23 per cent in March, the Sensex at BSE revived sharply by 14.4 per cent in April.
Experts say as the government has announced to significantly relax the lockdown restrictions in districts marked in green and orange, and also allow certain business activities in districts marked in red, it will restart some economic activity in the country that has come to a grinding halt.
“While there has been relative control in the spread of virus in India, the uncertainty still continues. However, as countries around the world are working on developing medicine and vaccine for Covid-19 and there seems to be some progress on it, a success on that front will lead to a V-shaped recovery in the economy and markets. Unless, there is a fresh scare on spread of virus, I think FPIs will not press the panic button,” said the CEO of a leading brokerage.
Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research, Morningstar India, said, “So far, India has been able to contain the COVID-19 pandemic from spreading aggressively. In addition to that, measures announced by the government and the RBI periodically to revitalize the sagging economy would have also resonated well with investors.”
He further added that with selective relaxation in the lockdown and gradual opening up of economic activity in the country, foreign investors will be closely watching the developments on this front.
They would also start looking at the domestic economic indicators as well to see how the country manages its deficits, he added.
“These are unprecedented scenarios; and with risk-taking going off the table, emerging markets like India may continue to witness similar trends for a prolonged period or until the time situation on the coronavirus front stabilizes,” said Srivastava.

In addition to that, measures announced by the government and the RBI periodically to revitalize the sagging economy would have also resonated well with investors," said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research, Morningstar India.
With selective relaxation in the lockdown and gradual opening up of economic activity in the country, foreign investors will be closely watching the developments on this front. They would also start looking at the domestic economic indicators as well to see how the country manages its deficits, he added.
"These are unprecedented scenarios; and with risk-taking going off the table, emerging markets like India may continue to witness similar trends for a prolonged period or until the time situation on the coronavirus front stabilizes," Srivastava said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Credit risk funds see outflows of Rs 11,134 crore in a week after Franklin Templeton crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mutual funds witnessed outflows of Rs 11,134 crore under credit risk funds in a week after Franklin Templeton decided to shut down six credit risk schemes on April 24 blaming the ongoing “liquidity crisis” in the market.
According to the Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI), net redemptions under credit risk funds stood at Rs 2,949.49 crore as of April 24, and peaked at Rs 4,294.36 crore as of April 27. “Thereafter, for the past three days i.e. on Tuesday April 28, April 29 and April 30, the net redemptions under credit risk funds stood at Rs 1,847.29 crore, Rs 1,251.17 crore and Rs 793.99 crore respectively,” AMFI said.
As the credit risk fund category had assets of over Rs 55,000 crore till March, over 20 per cent of the funds was pulled out by investors in the last week of April alone. The overall debt segment had witnessed outflows of Rs 1.94 lakh crore in the month of March.
However, AMFI said net redemptions under credit risk funds, one of debt mutual fund scheme category, which constitute less than 5 per cent of total debt mutual fund AUM, are tapering off substantially, post RBI’s announcement of special liquidity measure of Rs 50,000 crore for the mutual fund industry.
“All mutual funds have met the redemptions in the normal course of business. There is 81.5 per cent drop in net redemptions in credit risk funds category on April 30 from the peak net redemptions as on April 27, courtesy measures announced by the RBI,” AMFI said.
Explained
While the RBI’s Rs 50,000 crore liquidity window has given some comfort to mutual funds, credit risk funds are most at risk if redemptions continue, particularly where funds have exposure to less liquid securities, such as unlisted securities and higher risk appetite through exposure to defaulted entities.
Nilesh Shah, Chairman, AMFI, said: ‘’Declining trend in net redemptions from credit risk funds is a welcome development, indicative of investors comfort from RBI’s special liquidity facility available to the MF industry. AMFI will continue to work with regulators for normal functioning of the market.”
Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund, the ninth largest mutual fund in the country, had given a big jolt to the investor community with its decision to wind up six yield-oriented managed credit funds with effect from April 23, 2020.
The six schemes — Franklin India low duration fund, dynamic accrual fund, credit risk fund, short term income plan, ultra short bond fund and income opportunities fund — have combined assets under management of around Rs 28,000 crore.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Credit risk funds have seen a net redemption of ₹8,186 crore over the past week, following the turbulence created by the sudden closure of six debt-oriented schemes by Franklin Templeton.
Net redemptions under such funds peaked to ₹4,294 crore on April 27, against ₹2,949 crore on April 24. Subsequently, they fell to ₹1,847 crore, ₹1,251 crore and ₹794 crore between April 28-30 as the RBI offered support to the MF industry.
Credit risk funds those that invest nearly two-thirds of their corpus in relatively low credit-rated debt instruments.
Nilesh Shah, Chairman, Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), said the declining trend in net redemptions from credit risk funds indicates investor comfort from RBI’s special liquidity facility to the MF industry. The AMFI will continue to work with regulators to ensure normal functioning of the market, he added.
Last Monday, the RBI had announced a special liquidity window of ₹50,000 crore for banks to lend specially to the mutual fund industry to tide over any redemption pressure from investors. Banks can now borrow 90-day funds from the RBI at the current repo rate of 4.4 per cent and on-lend to MFs or purchase investment-grade corporate papers held by them.
The RBI scheme is available between April 27 and May 11. Banks buying securities from MFs can hold them in their held-to-maturity segment, even if the total investment in that category overshoots the central bank’s limits. The advantage of the segment is that banks do not have to account for mark-to-market losses in case the bond values fall further.
As of April 23, four mutual fund houses, including Franklin Templeton, had borrowed ₹4,428 crore from banks to meet redemption requests.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Norwegian Air gets bondholder deal on US$1.2b debt-for-equity swap</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OSLO, May 4 — Norwegian Air said yesterday it had secured support from enough bondholders for a US$1.2 billion (RM5.15 billion) debt-for-equity swap, a vital step in helping it survive the coronavirus crisis.
The budget airline is poised to run out of cash by mid-May without approval for its plan, which involves handing over most of the company to its lessors and bondholders.
Airlines around the world have been hit particularly hard by the impact on travel of the coronavirus pandemic, with many forced to turn to governments for state aid to avoid bankruptcy.
The next step for Norwegian Air is to secure support from its lessors for its rescue plan, ahead of an extraordinary general meeting today to get approval from shareholders.
Bondholders had turned down Norwegian Air’s plan on Friday, but yesterday the airline said it had now secured a written agreement with the largest bondholders of the NAS07, without naming them, to improve some of the terms.
Although holders of three of its four bonds had given sufficient backing on Friday, support among holders of the NAS07 bond had fallen short of the minimum requirement, with only 62 per cent voting in favour, less than the 67 per cent required.
“I am pleased to confirm that we have reached an agreement with the bondholders,” CEO Jacob Shram said in a statement, which said that a vote will still need to take place on May 18 to ensure Norwegian Air secures the necessary 67 per cent support.
The agreement will provide an improvement of terms for holders of the NAS07 — whose collateral include slots to fly in and out of London’s Gatwick airport — so that the value of their bonds after the conversion may be increased by up to 38 per cent, against 20 per cent earlier, based on valuations of the Gatwick slots.
The same terms would apply for holders of another bond, the NAS08, but not for those of the NAS09, Norwegian Air said.
Also today, Norwegian is set to decide the timeline for the launch of a share issue, which will end on May 18. The airline has said it plans to raise 400 million crowns.
If successful, the debt-to-equity plan allows the carrier to tap government guarantees of up to 2.7 billion Norwegian crowns (US$265 million), which hinge on a reduction in its debt to equity ratio, on top of 300 million crowns it has already received.
Norwegian Air is only paying invoices vital to maintaining minimum operations, such as salaries for staff still employed and critical IT infrastructure. It has put payments for ground handling, debt and leases on hold. — Reuters

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Thousands of jobs could be at risk at British aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, which on Sunday said it was in talks with unions about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on operations.
As many as 8,000 jobs could be affected, according to one person familiar with the matter, as the firm grappled with what it said was the "unprecedented" fall-out from the global pandemic.
"We have taken swift action to increase our liquidity, dramatically reducing our spending in 2020, and strengthen our resilience in these exceptionally challenging times," a spokesman said.
"But we will need to take further action," he added.
The company, which has 50,000 staff in 50 countries, including some 24,000 in the UK, is working with employee and union representatives.
Further details on job losses would be given to staff before the end of the month, the spokesman said.
The global aviation industry has been badly affected by the outbreak, forcing flights to be cancelled because of lack of demand and restrictions on travel.
According to the International Air Transport Association trade body, air traffic dropped by more than half in March compared with the same period last year.
US aerospace giant Boeing has said it expected to make thousands of job cuts because of the fall in traffic volume, with demand dropping to levels not seen since 2006.
Traffic had previously dropped 10.3 percent year-on-year in February.
Europe's Airbus last week reported a net first-quarter loss of 481 million euros ($522 million), compared to a profit of 40 million euros in the same period last year.
Airbus said in early April it had cut aircraft production by around a third as global airlines scaled back their plans because of the pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus | European leaders push vaccine financing drive</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">European leaders are backing an initiative from Brussels to raise 7.5 billion euros (£6.6 billion, $8.3 billion) to find a vaccine to curb the global COVID-19 pandemic.
The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, outlined the fund-raising plan for the scientific fight-back against COVID-19 on Friday.
An online pledging conference will take place on Monday to plug gaps in financing of research.
Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel gave their support in an open letter published in weekend newspapers.
The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and Norway’s Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, also signed and all gave their backing to the World Health Organization in the face of US criticism about its handling of the crisis.
The funds raised will “kickstart an unprecedented global cooperation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organisations, foundations and healthcare professionals”, the leaders said.
But they warned that more money would still be needed to manufacture and deliver “available, accessible and affordable” medicines across the world.
“If we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st century,” they added.
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Saudi Arabia and the European Commission, are co-hosting the conference, which is part of a month-long international investment drive before the Global Vaccine Summit on June 4.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care with COVID-19, said finding a treatment was “the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes”.
He will confirm Britain’s pledge of £388 million for vaccine research, tests and treatments, which is part of a wider £744 million to the global effort against the virus.
“To win this battle, we must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people, and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine,” he will tell delegates, according to his office.
“The more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed.”
Dozens of research projects are under way around the world to find a vaccine, which the United Nations has said is the only way for a return to normal life.
On Thursday, British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca announced a partnership with Oxford University for the large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently on trial.

    <h5 class="mb-1">European leaders unveil plans to raise $8 billion for Covid-19 treatments and vaccine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The European Union and its partners will host an international pledging conference on May 4 to raise $8 billion to kick-start global cooperation on effective diagnostics, treatments and a vaccine for Covid-19.
European Council President Charles Michel, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg issued a joint appeal on Sunday for contributions to the Coronavirus global response.
Saudi Arabia, the current president of the G20, on Sunday pledged $500 million to support the fundraising efforts and said it will co-lead the global response.
“The pledging event aims to raise funds for the immediate need of $8 billion, which the Global Preparedness and Monitoring Board stated is urgently required to develop and deliver a Covid-19 vaccine, along with diagnostics and therapeutic resources,” said a statement from the Saudi government.
People familiar with developments said the Indian government is yet to take a call in participating in the drive.
The European leaders said in a statement that they intended to raise the initial $8 billion to make up a global funding shortfall estimated by the Global Preparedness and Monitoring Board and others.
“The funds that we raise will kick-start an unprecedented global cooperation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organisations, foundations and healthcare professionals,” the statement said.
All the funds will be channelled through recognised global health organisations such as CEPI, Gavi, Vaccines Alliance, Global Fund and Unitaid to develop and deploy as “quickly as possible, for as many as possible, the diagnostics, treatments and vaccines that will help the world overcome the pandemic”, it added.
The European leaders said they will also support the World Health Organization and join forces with entities such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust for developing diagnostics and treatment.
“While some are cautiously emerging from lockdown, others are still in isolation and see their daily social and economic lives severely restricted. Consequences could be particularly dramatic in Africa and the Global South as a whole,” the statement said.
“But what we all have in common is that none of us can really think or plan ahead with any great certainty about what the future of the pandemic really holds,” it said, emphasising the need for joint efforts against the pandemic.
The European leaders said they were building on the commitment by G20 leaders to develop a “massive and coordinated response to the virus” and had launched the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) accelerator, a global platform to scale-up research, development, access and equitable distribution of a vaccine and other life-saving therapeutics and diagnostics treatments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Deputy finance minister urges Sarb to print money – Report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">South Africa’s finance deputy minister was quoted in a leading newspaper on Sunday as urging the central bank to temporarily create money to fund the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic fallout.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, David Masondo called on the government to avert a 1930s-style depression by getting the central bank to buy government bonds directly to fund the country’s deficit during the coronavirus crisis.
“Such bonds must be once-off special bonds with earned proceeds, and should be treated as a temporary measure with a clear exit plan,” he was quoted by the paper as saying.
“Such money from the Sarb (South African Reserve Bank) must be used for immediate Covid-19 health-related interventions and … economic recovery measures,” he added.
A central bank spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
President Cyril Ramaphosa last month announced a record R500 billion rescue package equalling 10% of the GDP of Africa’s most industrialised nation, to cushion the economic blow of the coronavirus pandemic. Since then debate has stirred as to how it is to be funded.
Ramaphosa has approached the IMF and World Bank, a sensitive issue in a government that has generally been hostile to the so-called Washington consensus.
Masondo is a former youth leader of South Africa’s Communist Party, but since Ramaphosa appointed him a year ago he has been a strong advocate of tough economic reforms, including clamping down on excessive government spending.
In an unprecedented move in March, the bank central did begin a programme of buying back government bonds from the secondary market to inject liquidity and prevent lending from seizing up.
But the idea of the central bank purchasing government debt directly to fund the deficit would most likely cross a red line for Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, a fiscal conservative who believes in central bank independence.
The government would also be keen to avoid a situation like neighbour Zimbabwe, whose runaway money-printing to pay its bills triggered massive hyperinflation a decade ago.

    <h5 class="mb-1">South Africa deputy finance minister urges central bank to print money to fund government: report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's finance deputy minister was quoted in a leading newspaper on Sunday as urging the central bank to temporarily create money to fund the government response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, David Masondo called on the government to avert a 1930s-style depression by getting the central bank to buy government bonds directly to fund the country's deficit during the coronavirus crisis.
"Such bonds must be once-off special bonds with earned proceeds, and should be treated as a temporary measure with a clear exit plan," he was quoted by the paper as saying.
"Such money from the SARB (South African Reserve Bank) must be used for immediate COVID-19 health-related interventions and ... economic recovery measures," he added.
A central bank spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
President Cyril Ramaphosa last month announced a record 500 billion rand ($26.3 billion) rescue package equalling 10% of the GDP of Africa's most industrialized nation, to cushion the economic blow of the coronavirus pandemic. Since then debate has stirred as to how it is to be funded.
Ramaphosa has approached the IMF and World Bank, a sensitive issue in a government that has generally been hostile to the so-called Washington consensus.
Masondo is a former youth leader of South Africa's Communist Party, but since Ramaphosa appointed him a year ago he has been a strong advocate of tough economic reforms, including clamping down on excessive government spending.
In an unprecedented move in March, the bank central did begin a programme of buying back government bonds from the secondary market to inject liquidity and prevent lending from seizing up.
But the idea of the central bank purchasing government debt directly to fund the deficit would most likely cross a red line for Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, a fiscal conservative who believes in central bank independence.
The government would also be keen to avoid a situation like neighbour Zimbabwe, whose runaway money-printing to pay its bills triggered massive hyperinflation a decade ago.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US aviation sector cuts more jobs amid travel meltdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: The ongoing US travel crisis is causing thousands of job cuts as the aviation sector waits for passengers to return to the skies but braces for years of lower demand because of the coronavirus pandemic.
US airlines are slashing hundreds of thousands of flights, cutting schedules by 80 per cent or more through at least June and parking thousands of jets as demand for tickets has plunged by about 95 per cent. Airlines are requiring facial coverings and implementing new cleaning procedures to try to convince passengers it is safe to fly again, but also fear the weakened economy may further drag down demand.
Late Friday, Spirit AeroSystems said that in response to lower production rates from Boeing and Airbus it would layoff 1,450 workers in Kansas.
"This sudden drop in air travel has forced our customers to adjust to lower demand from airlines, many of which are seeking to defer or cancel airplane orders," Spirit AeroSystems chief executive Tom Gentile told employees in an email seen by Reuters. "All indications right now tell us this lower demand for new commercial airplanes is likely to last for several years."
On Wednesday, Boeing announced it would cut some production rates and eliminate about 16,000 jobs worldwide, or 10per cent of its workforce by year end.
Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said he expects it will "take two to three years for travel to return to 2019 levels and it will be a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term growth trends." The cuts in some areas, such as commercial airplanes, will be more than 15per cent, Boeing said.
Delta Air Lines Inc said last week it does not expect air travel to recover for two or three years. More than 37,000 Delta employees have volunteered to take unpaid leave lasting from one month to a year.
American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that the airline will be "smaller than we intended to be certainly into 2021."
Labor union SEIU said Thursday at least 13,000 union members at airports have been laid off and another 1,000 layoffs are planned. The US Treasury has not yet awarded US$3 billion in payroll assistance cash grants approved by Congress for airport contractors such as baggage handlers and airplane caterers.
US airlines last month collectively were awarded US$25 billion in Treasury cash grants but as a condition must not fire workers or reduce through Sep 30.
Numerous airlines have warned that without a dramatic turnaround in passenger numbers they will be forced to make new significant cuts before year end.
JPMorgan Chase said in a research note on Friday that "Oct 1 is likely to emerge as one of the darkest days in history for airline labour" - though it noted that Congress could opt to extend additional assistance.
United Airlines is reducing working hours by 25 per cent for 15,000 employees starting May 24, drawing criticism from an employee union and some U.S. lawmakers who contend that the move violates the terms of the US$5 billion payroll assistance United is receiving from the Treasury.
"The taxpayers of this country have offered a generous bailout to your company and you should, in turn, honour this trust by keeping the promises you made to those you employ," Republican Senator Josh Hawley wrote United on Friday.
United declined to comment on Hawley's letter on Saturday but its chief operations officer Greg Hart told employees in an email on Friday that the reduction in hours does not violate the terms of the government assistance.
He said United is "making similar changes for our management personnel" and that those changes will be announced on Monday.
Last month, General Electric said it was furloughing 50 per cent of workers in US engine assembly and component manufacturing operations, a move that impacted thousands of employees. That followed the 2,600 US job cuts announced in March by GE's aviation unit, which makes engines for Boeing and Airbus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gold bars fight COVID kits for space on the plane</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Swiss refiner Valcambi SA tried for five straight days last month to move a shipment of gold out of Hong Kong. Twice the metal was packed carefully onto a plane, only to be offloaded again.
After daily attempts and numerous arguments, the gold suddenly arrived in Switzerland without warning, said Chief Executive Officer Michael Mesaric. "We had not even asked for a slot."
The coronavirus crisis has shone a light on a corner of precious metals markets that usually draws little attention: the logistics of transporting gold, silver and other metals across the world. The business is dominated by companies including Brink's Co., G4S Plc, Loomis AB and Malca-Amit, which link miners and refiners with gold trading and consumption hubs around the world.
In normal times, gold bars worth millions of dollars travel the world in the cargo holds of commercial planes, just a few meters from the feet of passengers, before being whisked in armored trucks to refineries and vaults. But the grounding of flights has had a chaotic effect on an industry that's used to relying on instantaneous delivery: prices in key markets have diverged dramatically, and the London gold market has even started talking about allowing delivery in other cities around the world.
Now, with global travel at a standstill, the precious metals industry is scrambling for alternative ways to keep the market moving. It's a world of logistical headaches: even when space can be found on a plane, packages are often turned away if essentials like medical supplies need to travel instead.
"The limited commercial flights, charters or freighters we are using must prioritize personal protection equipment, medical, food and other essential products over our requirements to move bullion," said Baskaran Narayanan, vice president at Brink's Asia Pacific Ltd.
Another big name in the business, Malca-Amit could deliver within 24 hours before the health crisis, said managing director of Malta-Amit Singapore Pte. Ariel Kohelet. Now it's more like 48 to 72 hours, and costs have risen.
"We've widened our use of cargo-only aircraft that are not dependent on passengers to fly and we've also chartered aircraft," he said.
Some in the market say they're managing to keep operating without delays. However, it's been particularly difficult to get metal in and out of Asia, said Robert Mish, president of precious-metals dealer Mish International Monetary Inc.
"Some customers understand it and some don't," said Mish. "Some customers will pay more now, and others will say, 'I understand,' and take delivery in two weeks."
It's even getting more expensive to move gold that doesn't typically travel by airplane.
German refiner C. Hafner GmbH + Co. KG used to send gold bars to neighboring Poland in security trucks. After road borders closed and its contractor stopped operating, the company has started flying the metal with FedEx Corp., said Torsten Schlindwein, deputy head of precious metals trading. Transportation costs have surged about 60% as a result.

The business is dominated by companies including Brink’s Co., G4S Plc, Loomis AB and Malca-Amit, which link miners and refiners with gold trading and consumption hubs around the world.
In normal times, gold bars worth millions of dollars travel the world in the cargo holds of commercial planes, just a few meters from the feet of passengers, before being whisked in armored trucks to refineries and vaults. But the grounding of flights has had a chaotic effect on an industry that’s used to relying on instantaneous delivery: prices in key markets have diverged dramatically, and the London gold market has even started talking about allowing delivery in other cities around the world.
Now, with global travel at a standstill, the precious metals industry is scrambling for alternative ways to keep the market moving. It’s a world of logistical headaches: even when space can be found on a plane, packages are often turned away if essentials like medical supplies need to travel instead.
"The limited commercial flights, charters or freighters we are using must prioritize personal protection equipment, medical, food and other essential products over our requirements to move bullion,” said Baskaran Narayanan, vice president at Brink’s Asia Pacific Ltd.
Another big name in the business, Malca-Amit could deliver within 24 hours before the health crisis, said managing director of Malta-Amit Singapore Pte. Ariel Kohelet. Now it’s more like 48 to 72 hours, and costs have risen.
"We’ve widened our use of cargo-only aircraft that are not dependent on passengers to fly and we’ve also chartered aircraft,” he said.
 
Some in the market say they’re managing to keep operating without delays. However, it’s been particularly difficult to get metal in and out of Asia, said Robert Mish, president of precious-metals dealer Mish International Monetary Inc.
"Some customers understand it and some don’t,” said Mish. "Some customers will pay more now, and others will say, ‘I understand,’ and take delivery in two weeks.”
It’s even getting more expensive to move gold that doesn’t typically travel by airplane.
German refiner C. Hafner GmbH + Co. KG used to send gold bars to neighboring Poland in security trucks. After road borders closed and its contractor stopped operating, the company has started flying the metal with FedEx Corp., said Torsten Schlindwein, deputy head of precious metals trading. Transportation costs have surged about 60% as a result.
Lockdown regulations and red tape have contributed to the delays, said Peter Thomas, a senior vice president at Chicago-based broker Zaner Group. When he tried to fly some silver out of Peru in early April, authorities initially refused to approve loading documents or allow union workers to load the plane. The metal was eventually moved on private aircraft, he said.
"It was expensive but it got done,” he said. "I think that as the virus subsides and as we get rolling again, we’re going to see a lot of product that has been sitting around, especially in smaller refineries, hit the market.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett says he dumped entire stake in airline-sector stocks: ‘The world changed for airlines’ amid coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway dumped all of its holdings in the airline sector, painting a grim picture of the industry that has been badly hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I was wrong about that business,” Buffett said, speaking on Saturday in Omaha, Neb., at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting, which was held virtually due to the deadly disease.
Back in April, Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, -1.04%BRK.B, -1.07% disclosed that it sold large blocks of stock in Delta Air Lines DAL, -3.81% and Southwest Airlines LUV, -4.13%.
Subsidiaries of Berkshire sold 13 million Delta shares for a total of $314.2 million and 2.3 million Southwest shares amounting to more than $74 million, as he looked to substantially scale back his ownership of the airlines sector which has been devastated by stay-at-home protocols that have been put in place since the coronavirus epidemic took hold of the world over the past three months.
Buffett, however, explained that his company and its subsidiaries have now unloaded their entire stake in airlines.
Buffett explained at the meeting that he thought he was getting roughly 10% of the four largest airlines for an attractive price. He also owned stakes in American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, -3.15% and United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, -4.51%. Collectively, those airlines, represent some 80% of the passenger miles flown in the U.S., Buffett said.
But he determined recently that his decision, in light of the emerging pathogen, was ill-advised and he sought to unload his position: “I just decided that I’d made a mistake.”
As of the most recent filings, Berkshire had held 70 million shares of Delta representing 1.7% of the conglomerate’s portfolio, according to data provider Whale Wisdom. Berkshire also had roughly 54 million shares of Southwest, representing 1.2% of its holdings, 22 million shares of United Airlines, representing 0.8% and 42.5 million shares of American Airlines, about 0.5% of Berkshire, according to the site.
“The airline business, and I may be wrong, and I hope I’m wrong, changed in a major way,” he explained, noting that it has been through no fault of the CEOs of the companies. “I’ve been basically told not to fly,” he added, noting that he may not fly commercial going forward.
“I wouldn’t normally talk about it, but I think it requires an explanation,” he said of his decision to discuss selling airline stocks.
“We like those airlines but the world has changed…and I don’t know how it’s changed,” he said.
Shares of Delta, the largest airline by market capitalization, were down 59% in the year to date, United Airlines were off nearly 70% so far this year, Southwest shares were down by about 46% thus far in 2020, and American Airlines was off 63% over the same period, as of Friday’s close. An exchange-traded fund that tracks the industry, U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS, -2.74%, was down by more than 55% in the year to date.
By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% was off 17% so far this year, after recovering much of its March decline in April. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.90% was looking at a year-to-date loss of 12.4% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.13% was down 4.1% so far in 2020.
Airlines received a $25 billion U.S. government bailout back in mid April to prop up the industry
The Trump administration reached an agreement with major airlines over the terms of a $25 billion bailout to prop up an industry hobbled by the coronavirus pandemic.
Volumes for airlines are down substantially, according to industry groups, with the aircraft and passenger volume down more than 90%, compared with a year ago, according to industry group Airlines for America, and more than 3,000 planes have been idled, constituting about half of the active fleets.
On Sunday, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said he thinks the first week of April was the worst period for his company of the coronavirus pandemic, and business should pick up from here.
Speaking in an interview on CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” he said, “I don’t think June will be a good month, but hopefully it will be a bit better than May.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett: ‘American magic’ will spur US economic recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">
Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, arrives at the May 2019 shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. AFP/File/Johannes EISELE
The 89-year-old made the sanguine prediction about the world’s largest economy as his holding company Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter net losses of nearly $50 billion.
Buffett also announced Saturday that his company had sold all its stakes in four major US airlines last month, as the pandemic clobbered the travel industry.
“It turns out I was wrong,” he said of his acquisitions of 10 percent stakes in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.
Berkshire Hathaway had paid $7 billion to $8 billion, and “we did not take out anything like that,” he said.
Between the purchases that took place over months, and the sale, “the airlines business I think changed in a very major way” and could no longer meet Berkshire criteria for profitability, he said.
Buffett’s announcement may further hurt airlines already pushed to the brink by coronavirus lockdown measures, now looking to the US government for $25 billion in relief funds.
‘American miracles, American magic’ 
Berkshire Hathaway, based in Omaha, Nebraska, called its first-quarter setback “temporary” but said it could not reliably predict when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
“We’ve faced great problems in the past, haven’t faced this exact problem — in fact we haven’t really faced anything that quite resembles this problem,” Buffett said in a lengthy speech on the country’s economic history.
“But we faced tougher problems, and the American miracles, American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again.”
“We are now a better country, as well as an incredibly more wealthy country, than we were in 1789… We got a long ways to go but we moved in the right direction,” he said, referencing the abolition of slavery and women’s suffrage.
“Never bet against America.”
Buffett is considered one of the savviest investors anywhere. His fortune of $72 billion is the fourth-largest in the world, according to Forbes, and in normal years, the company’s annual gathering in Omaha is a high-point of the calendar for investors, a “Woodstock for capitalists.”
But the devastating economic impact of the pandemic has hit hard at Berkshire Hathaway’s wide range of investments, and the need for social distancing forced it to hold the annual meeting online.
Buffett addressed his shareholders in a livestream flanked only by Gregory Abel, who is in charge of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations.
His business partner for six decades, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not appear.
Growth by one measure 
Buffett, in a statement, played down his company’s bleak-looking net figure. He said a better measure of the company’s performance was its operating earnings, which exclude investments and are less subject to sharp fluctuations.
By that measure, Berkshire Hathaway saw growth to $5.9 billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier.
The brutal drop in the net — to a loss of $49.75 billion from a profit last year of $21.7 billion — resulted primarily from the virus-related decline in value of its broad investment portfolio, which ranges from energy to transport to insurance and technology.
The annual meeting often has an almost carnival atmosphere, as thousands of fans and investors flock to Nebraska to hear from the celebrated “Oracle of Omaha.” Buffett, famous for his relatively modest lifestyle, turns 90 on August 30.
In documents filed Saturday, Berkshire noted that until mid-March many of its companies were posting “comparative revenue and earnings increases” over the same 2019 period.
Many of its companies — including in rail transport, energy production and some manufacturing and service businesses — are deemed essential and are able to continue working amid the far-reaching confinement orders.
But their turnover slowed considerably in April, the company statement said.
Moves taken by those companies such as employee furloughs, salary cuts and reductions, and capital spending reductions are “necessary actions” and “temporary,” it said.

His business partner for six decades, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not appear.
– Growth by one measure –
Buffett, in a statement, played down his company’s bleak-looking net figure. He said a better measure of the company’s performance was its operating earnings, which exclude investments and are less subject to sharp fluctuations.
By that measure, Berkshire Hathaway saw growth to $5.9 billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier.
The brutal drop in the net — to a loss of $49.75 billion from a profit last year of $21.7 billion — resulted primarily from the virus-related decline in value of its broad investment portfolio, which ranges from energy to transport to insurance and technology.
The annual meeting often has an almost carnival atmosphere, as thousands of fans and investors flock to Nebraska to hear from the celebrated “Oracle of Omaha.” Buffett, famous for his relatively modest lifestyle, turns 90 on August 30.
In documents filed Saturday, Berkshire noted that until mid-March many of its companies were posting “comparative revenue and earnings increases” over the same 2019 period.
Many of its companies — including in rail transport, energy production and some manufacturing and service businesses — are deemed essential and are able to continue working amid the far-reaching confinement orders.
But their turnover slowed considerably in April, the company statement said.
Moves taken by those companies such as employee furloughs, salary cuts and reductions, and capital spending reductions are “necessary actions” and “temporary,” it said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'American magic' will spur US economic recovery: Warren Buffett</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: Billionaire investor Warren Buffet said Saturday he's confident the US economy will bounce back from its pummeling by the coronavirus pandemic because "American magic has always prevailed."
The 89-year-old made the sanguine prediction about the world's largest economy as his holding company Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter net losses of nearly $50 billion.
Buffett also announced Saturday that his company had sold all its stakes in four major US airlines last month, as the pandemic clobbered the travel industry.
"It turns out I was wrong," he said of his acquisitions of 10 percent stakes in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.
Berkshire Hathaway had paid $7 billion to $8 billion, and "we did not take out anything like that," he said.
Between the purchases that took place over months, and the sale, "the airlines business I think changed in a very major way" and could no longer meet Berkshire criteria for profitability, he said.
Buffett's announcement may further hurt airlines already pushed to the brink by coronavirus lockdown measures, now looking to the US government for $25 billion in relief funds.
- 'American miracles, American magic' - Berkshire Hathaway, based in Omaha, Nebraska, called its first-quarter setback "temporary" but said it could not reliably predict when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
"We've faced great problems in the past, haven't faced this exact problem -- in fact we haven't really faced anything that quite resembles this problem," Buffett said in a lengthy speech on the country's economic history.
"But we faced tougher problems, and the American miracles, American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again."
"We are now a better country, as well as an incredibly more wealthy country, than we were in 1789... We got a long ways to go but we moved in the right direction," he said, referencing the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage.
"Never bet against America."
Buffett is considered one of the savviest investors anywhere. His fortune of $72 billion is the fourth-largest in the world, according to Forbes, and in normal years, the company's annual gathering in Omaha is a high-point of the calendar for investors, a "Woodstock for capitalists."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oil's Recovery Could Take Decades, Not Years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Who knows what the new normal for oil demand will be once Covid-19 is firmly in the rear view mirror? Not me, that's for sure. But it is likely to be lower than it was in 2019, and it could be that way for many years. That’s going to create overcapacity throughout the oil supply chain and weigh on prices.
While signs are emerging that we might have passed the worst of this historic oil demand rout, they’re very tentative. No one is predicting a swift recovery to where we were before the pandemic struck. Some, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s chief executive officer, Ben van Beurden, suggest that oil demand may never recover fully.
Citigroup analysts don’t see jet fuel consumption back at last year’s level until well into 2022, and they’re at the optimistic end of the spectrum. Boeing’s CEO suggests passenger traffic might not get back to 2019 levels for three years, and even when the flying public does return, airlines will use their newest and most efficient planes to carry them, as my colleagues Liam Denning and Brooke Sutherland note here.
So let’s make a guess about the loss in future demand, and let’s make a fairly small one. Let’s assume it’s about 5 million barrels a day. That doesn’t sound like too much; it’s about 5% of last year’s global oil demand. The drop in worldwide oil consumption in April has been put as high as 35 million barrels a day, and forecasts estimate 2020 oil use will be about 10 million barrels a day (or 10%) lower than in 2019.
Sure, many of us will return to our pre-Covid-19 ways of life just as quickly as we can, but others will gladly give up the daily commute in favor of working from home more often — and employers may be happy to accommodate their wishes. After months of successful teleconferencing, those business trips that helped keep planes full of high-paying travelers may also come under more scrutiny. These changes may push up electricity use while they dampen fuel demand, but that will do little to help the oil industry, which is increasingly struggling to hold onto its fragments of the power-generation sector.
Of course, we could collectively shrug off this latest crisis, just as we did the financial crash of 2008-09, which was consigned to history with barely a backward glance. But the global pandemic feels very different from the financial crisis. It hits at our physical well-being as well as our financial health, and it has forced us all, to one degree or another, to adopt new ways of living and working, whether we like them or not. 
The industry can survive a 5% drop in long-term demand, but it will find it much harder to thrive.
A loss like that will cause structural overcapacity, right through the oil supply chain. There will be too many wells to get oil out of the ground, too many ships to move it, too many refineries to process it.
Even before the pandemic, we were looking at a world where oil demand growth was increasingly concentrated in plastics, rather than fuels. That was already darkening the outlook for refiners in Europe and North America, which were also facing growing competition from newer plants in the Middle East and Asia that were more efficient and had beneficial long-term oil supply deals. A prolonged drop in demand will only make that competition stiffer, as more plants seek markets for their excess products.
The upstream part of the business — the bit that’s concerned with finding the crude and getting it out of the ground — may face fewer problems. Oil fields naturally go into decline once they’re brought into operation, requiring producers to create new capacity elsewhere. Nowhere is that more obvious than in the U.S. shale patch.
But the second U.S. shale boom was driven by, among other things, several years of robust growth in global oil demand. This led to most of the world’s oil producers, including almost all of the OPEC countries, pumping as hard as they could, and helped to keep oil prices at around $50 a barrel.
But those OPEC producers are now cutting production by more than 20%, and non-OPEC countries are seeing their output fall by similar percentages. True, some of the wells that get shut will never be reopened, but most will sit waiting for their owners to see an opportunity to get them back to work. That overhang of spare production capacity will put an effective cap on oil prices, just as it did throughout the 1990s.
No amount of Saudi-led supply management, or U.S. presidential bullying of foreign oil producers, will be able to remove that spare capacity. And once the current crisis is past, Riyadh may be less willing to play the role of swing producer, restraining its output while everybody else reopens the taps.
Every time oil prices rise, producers will rush to use their idled capacity, undermining the recovery. After the oil-price slump of the mid-1980s, it took two decades for prices to return to their previous levels — longer if you build in the effects of inflation. This time the wait could be even more protracted.

Of course, we could collectively shrug off this latest crisis, just as we did the financial crash of 2008-09, which was consigned to history with barely a backward glance. But the global pandemic feels very different from the financial crisis. It hits at our physical well-being as well as our financial health, and it has forced us all, to one degree or another, to adopt new ways of living and working, whether we like them or not. 
The industry can survive a 5% drop in long-term demand, but it will find it much harder to thrive.
A loss like that will cause structural overcapacity, right through the oil supply chain. There will be too many wells to get oil out of the ground, too many ships to move it, too many refineries to process it.
Even before the pandemic, we were looking at a world where oil demand growth was increasingly concentrated in plastics, rather than fuels. That was already darkening the outlook for refiners in Europe and North America, which were also facing growing competition from newer plants in the Middle East and Asia that were more efficient and had beneficial long-term oil supply deals. A prolonged drop in demand will only make that competition stiffer, as more plants seek markets for their excess products.
The upstream part of the business — the bit that’s concerned with finding the crude and getting it out of the ground — may face fewer problems. Oil fields naturally go into decline once they’re brought into operation, requiring producers to create new capacity elsewhere. Nowhere is that more obvious than in the U.S. shale patch.
But the second U.S. shale boom was driven by, among other things, several years of robust growth in global oil demand. This led to most of the world’s oil producers, including almost all of the OPEC countries, pumping as hard as they could, and helped to keep oil prices at around $50 a barrel.
But those OPEC producers are now cutting production by more than 20%, and non-OPEC countries are seeing their output fall by similar percentages. True, some of the wells that get shut will never be reopened, but most will sit waiting for their owners to see an opportunity to get them back to work. That overhang of spare production capacity will put an effective cap on oil prices, just as it did throughout the 1990s.
No amount of Saudi-led supply management, or U.S. presidential bullying of foreign oil producers, will be able to remove that spare capacity. And once the current crisis is past, Riyadh may be less willing to play the role of swing producer, restraining its output while everybody else reopens the taps.
Every time oil prices rise, producers will rush to use their idled capacity, undermining the recovery. After the oil-price slump of the mid-1980s, it took two decades for prices to return to their previous levels — longer if you build in the effects of inflation. This time the wait could be even more protracted.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Temperatures fall 7 to 10 degrees below average in parts of Queensland</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The cold snap affecting much of Queensland is expected to hang around for another morning or two, with the mercury predicted to sink close to or even below freezing in some parts on Monday.
The Sunshine Coast was seven degrees below the May average overnight while the Wide Bay region experienced conditions from 7 to 10 degrees below average.
Thangool on the Capricornia coast, about 120 kilometres south of Rockhampton, was the coolest spot in the state overnight, at just 3.6 degrees.
On Saturday morning, the temperature in Oakey, west of Toowoomba, had fallen to minus 0.4 degrees and Kingaroy, north-west of Brisbane, broke the freezing barrier with minus 0.1.
Weather bureau senior meteorologist Gabriel Branescu said the weather should warm up from Tuesday and Wednesday in coastal areas.
He said inland parts should get relief from Thursday to Saturday but not before a return to possible freezing temperatures near Stanthorpe and the Darling Downs on Monday.
"We have a slow-moving high-pressure system in the Great Australian Bight directing the really dry and cool air mass directly across the state," he said.
“Temperatures will start to moderate from Tuesday and Wednesday next week as the winds will tend more easterly and bring in more moisture from the ocean.
"We’re expecting the minimum temperatures to stay about 13 or 14 degrees in Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, around 11 or 12 degrees in the Gold Coast area.
"Cool temperatures will remain inland for another two or three mornings until the warmer and more moist air mass will make its way to the Northern Territory border later next week."
During the early hours of Sunday, Kingaroy, in the Wide Bay and Burnett region, hit a low of 4 degrees while Gayndah and Maryborough reached 5.6.
In the south-eastern corner, Greenbank in Logan recorded just 5.9 degrees overnight, Beaudesert experienced 6.8 and the Sunshine Coast Airport dropped to 7.
In the Darling Downs and Granite Belt, Applethorpe recorded 7.7 degrees, Dalby hit 6, Miles got to 7.3 and Oakey reached 6.9.
Across the state's centre, Roma, Charleville and Rolleston Airport had a low of 5.2 degrees, Blackall experienced 5.7, Hughenden dropped to 6.6 and Richmond recorded 6.9.
Meanwhile, Woolshed in north Queensland recorded 8.3 degrees and the Mackay Racecourse on the central Queensland coast dropped to 8.2 overnight.
Mr Branescu said Monday would bring another chilly start to the day.
"Cooler temperatures are here to stay for a few more nights, especially on Monday morning, we expect temperatures to drop even below zero around the Stanthorpe and Darling Downs area … where the minimum temperatures can drop to minus one", he said.
"Roma may also see temperatures dropping to near zero. So large areas of frost in the Darling Downs, Maranoa and Warrego for another morning or two."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Temperatures to tumble dramatically in Northeast during first full week of May</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After the first weekend of May provided a quick break from chilly air dominating the Northeast, the start of the workweek will send temperatures tumbling once again.
While April left much to be desired for warm weather fans across the region, temperatures rebounded on Saturday. Afternoon highs topped out from the upper 50s in northern Maine, to the lower 70s in southern Pennsylvania and Maryland.
"After ending the month of April an average of 3.5 degrees cooler than normal, Boston soared to 70 on Saturday, which is actually 8 degrees above normal for early May," AccuWeather Meteorologist Mary Gilbert said.
Sunday will feature temperatures 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit higher on average than the previous day in some locations across the Northeast.
As some residents look to take advantage of another pleasant day outdoors, others will have to find time between bouts of wet weather.
A storm system that brought showers and thunderstorms to the region on Saturday night will persist over New England and creep into the mid-Atlantic.
As the storm continues to move away from the northeastern United States on Monday, winds will turn out of the northwest and a cooler air mass will move in.
Warm weather forecast to finish out the weekend will be replaced by afternoon temperatures 10-20 degrees lower to start the workweek.
On Monday, high temperatures along coastal areas will linger in the 60s, but interior locations will struggle to climb out of the 50s.
By Tuesday, most locations can expect temperatures in the 50s. However, temperatures from southern Pennsylvania to Connecticut, will once again climb into the low 60s.
High elevations in New England will be limited to the 40s each day.
Residents from Boston to New York City, Philadelphia and Detroit looking for a quick return to warmth will be disappointed.
The dip in the jet stream will remain over the northeastern U.S. This will keep chilly conditions over the region and the storm track over the Southeast and mid-Atlantic.
Even colder air will settle over the Northeast into the end of the week, dropping temperatures to around 10-15 degrees below normal for the beginning of May.
Average temperatures at the beginning of May range from the upper 50s in northern New England to the lower 70s around D.C.
"Those in the Northeast feeling a bit stir-crazy under COVID-19 stay-at-home orders will want to grab a jacket if heading outside, while following proper social distancing protocols," Gilbert said.
AccuWeather's long-range team expects several more bouts of cooler-than-average air to sweep into the Northeast every few days into the middle of May. Those hoping for hot weather may have to wait until the calendar is fully into the summer months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Modi Meets Ministers to Finalize Steps to Revive Indian Economy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed ways to increase liquidity and credit to businesses, infrastructure and farming sectors to restart Asia’s third-largest economy, which is reeling under the impact of the world’s toughest lockdown.
In a meeting with senior ministers, including Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and other key government officials on May 2, Modi discussed strategies and interventions to support small businesses and farmers as the country prepares to allow some activity to revive the economy. Talks revolved around enhancing liquidity and strengthening credit flows for a quick recovery after the country was shut towards the end of March to check the spread of Covid-19, according to a statement posted on Twitter.
Prime Minister Modi announced a total lockdown on March 24, shutting all but essential goods and services. That halted manufacturing and wiped out consumption, the backbone of the economy which is heading for it first contraction in more than four decades. The government has extended the stay-at-home orders for another two weeks from May 4 but eased restrictions in some areas to restart economic activity.
Revival of the infrastructure sector and speedier implementation of construction projects that involve large scale employment were examined, the statement added. The government is considering a proposal to guarantee as much as 3 trillion rupees ($40 billion) of loans to small businesses, people familiar with the matter said last month.
India’s central bank Governor Shaktikanta Das met chief executive officers of the nation’s banks on May 2 to discuss ways to ensure credit flow to businesses once the lockdown order ends.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM Modi for new structural reforms to revive economy hit by COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi, May 02: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday underlined the need for new structural reforms and expedite work on infrastructure projects to revive the economy reeling under the impact of coronavirus-induced lockdown.
He made these observations during a series of meetings held on Saturday to discuss strategies and interventions in the financial sector as well as structural reforms to spur growth and welfare in the current context.
The series of meetings with key Cabinet ministers, officials of economic ministries is likely to culminate into a second stimulus package for sectors, including MSME and the farm sector, hit hard by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.
Dwelling on the issue of welfare of workers and the common man, the Prime Minister pointed out the need to generate gainful employment opportunities by helping businesses overcome difficulties due to disruptions caused by COVID-19, an official statement said.
The Prime Minister also stressed on the need to strengthen major structural reforms undertaken in the past and new structural reforms in the areas of corporate governance, credit markets and infrastructure sectors were also discussed, it said.
He also stressed the need to take speedy measures to commence work on new infrastructure projects and speed up works in the infrastructure sector so as to make up for the time lost in COVID-19.
He wanted the projects taken up under the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) be reviewed at the highest level frequently to avoid time delays and enable the creation of jobs.
The task force on NIP has recently submitted a report which projected a staggering Rs 111 lakh crore investment in the infrastructure sector by 2024-25.
The statement further said that it was also discussed that the reform initiatives undertaken by the various Ministries should continue unabated and the action should be taken in a time-bound manner to remove any obstacles to investment flows and capital formation.
The meeting was attended by the Home Minister, the Finance Minister, Secretaries of the Ministry of Finance along with senior officials of the Government of India.
At a meeting with the finance minister and officials, the prime minister discussed strategies and interventions to support MSMEs and farmers, enhance liquidity and strengthen credit flows.
He also discussed ways and means to ensure financial stability in the wake of COVID-19 and measures taken to enable businesses to recover quickly from the impacts.
Earlier in the day, MSME Minister Nitin Gadkari said that his ministry has suggested a relief package to the prime minister and the finance minister for the medium, small and micro sector and exuded confidence that an announcement would be made soon. "Chaired a meeting on strengthening our MSME sector, which plays a pivotal role in economic development.
There were extensive discussions on ways to make this sector more vibrant, attractive and ready to embrace new opportunities," the prime minister said in a tweet after the meeting.
The Prime Minister in another tweet said, "Held a meeting to discuss subjects related to the financial world, including structural reforms that will give a boost to growth and public welfare. We reviewed strategies to support the MSME sector and ensure liquidity & credit supply."
The central government is focused on ensuring welfare of workers, helping businesses overcome the difficulties arising in the wake of COVID-19, reforms in corporate governance, credit markets and the infra sector, he said.
During another meeting concerning the farm sector, various reforms in agriculture marketing, management of marketable surplus, access of farmers to institutional credit and freeing the agriculture sector of various restrictions with appropriate backing of the statute were discussed.
The focus was on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco-system and bringing appropriate reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development, an official statement said.
"Concessional credit flow to strengthen agriculture infrastructure, special Kisan Credit Card saturation drive for PM-Kisan beneficiaries and facilitating inter and intra-state trade of agriculture produce to ensure the fairest return to farmer were some of the important areas covered. Developing e-NAM into a platform of platforms to enable e-commerce was one of the important topics of discussion," it said.
A discussion also emanated on the possibilities of the uniform statutory framework in the country to facilitate new ways for farming which will infuse capital and technology in agrarian economy, it said, adding, the pros and cons of bio-technological developments in crops or enhancement of productivity and reduction in input costs were also deliberated.
During the deliberations, each ministry made recommendations and possible steps to be taken in the short run to prop up the sector administered by them.
After a detailed review of every sector, a relief and stimulus package will be worked out, sources said.
The prime minister already had meetings with different ministries including civil aviation, labour and power on Friday.
He had detailed deliberation with commerce and industry ministry among others on Thursday.
To mitigate hardships faced by the bottom of the pyramid, the government in late March had announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore stimulus package comprising free foodgrains and cooking gas to poor and cash doles to poor women and elderly.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘World has changed,' Buffett says, as Berkshire sells all holdings in largest U.S. airlines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines in April, chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company’s annual meeting, saying “the world has changed” for the aviation industry.
The conglomerate had held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11-per-cent stake in Delta Air Lines, 10 per cent of American Airlines Co., 10 per cent of Southwest Airlines Co. and 9 per cent of United Airlines at the end of 2019, according to its annual report and company filings.
The conglomerate was one of the largest individual holders in the four airlines and in 2016 disclosed it had begun investing in the four carriers after avoiding the sector for years.
Airline stocks have been hard hit by the near-collapse of U.S. travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. airlines are cutting hundreds of thousands of flights and parking thousands of planes. U.S. travel demand has fallen by about 95 per cent and there is no clear timetable for passengers to return to flights at precrisis levels.
Mr. Buffett said the airline industry’s outlook changed rapidly.
“We made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss,” Mr. Buffett said. “We will not fund a company ... where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future.”
Berkshire disclosed on April 3 it had sold about 18 per cent of its Delta stake and 4 per cent of its Southwest shares.
Mr. Buffett said Berkshire had invested between US$7-billion and US$8-billion amassing stakes in the four airlines including American Airlines Group Inc.
“We did not take out anything like $7- or $8-billion and that was my mistake,” Mr. Buffett said at the company’s annual meeting which was livestreamed. “I am the one who made the decision.”
Southwest, American and United declined comment.
Delta said in a statement it was aware of the sale and has “tremendous respect for Mr. Buffett and the Berkshire team.” The airline added it remains “confident that the strengths that are core to Delta’s business – our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability – will endure and position Delta to succeed.”
Mr. Buffett said he previously considered investing in additional airlines.
“It is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up ... It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” Mr. Buffett added.
Mr. Buffett previously expressed grim sentiments about the financial outlook for airlines. He did invest in USAir in 1989.
“If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favour by shooting Orville down,” Mr. Buffett wrote in his 2007 annual letter. “Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it.”

Buffett said he previously considered investing in additional airlines. "It is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up.... It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country," Buffett added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett announces Berkshire's decision to sell entire stake in US airlines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway Inc sold its entire stakes in the four largest US airlines in April, Chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company's annual meeting, saying "the world has changed" for the aviation industry.
The conglomerate had held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11 per cent stake in Delta Air Lines, 10 per cent of American Airlines Co, 10 per cent of Southwest Airlines Co and 9 per cent of United Airlines at the end of 2019, according to its annual report and company filings.
The conglomerate was one of the largest individual holders in the four airlines and in 2016 disclosed it had begun investing in the four carriers after avoiding the sector for years.
Airline stocks have been hard hit by the near collapse US travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.
US airlines are cutting hundreds of thousands of flights, parking thousands of planes as US travel demand has fallen by about 95 per cent and there is no clear timetable for passengers to return to flights at pre-crisis levels. Buffett said the airline industry's outlook rapidly changed.
"We made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss," Buffett said. "We will not fund a company that - where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future."
Berkshire disclosed on April 3 it had sold about 18 per cent of its Delta stake and 4 per cent of its Southwest shares. Buffett said Berkshire had invested around USD 7 billion or USD 8 billion amassing stakes in the four airlines including American Airlines Group Inc.
"We did not take out anything like USD 7 or USD 8 billion and that was my mistake," Buffett said at the company's annual meeting which was live-streamed. "I am the one who made the decision."
Southwest, American and United declined to comment.
Delta said in a statement it was aware of the sale and has "tremendous respect for Mr. Buffett and the Berkshire team." The airline added it remains "confident that the strengths that are core to Delta's business - our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability - will endure and position Delta to succeed."
Buffett said he previously considered investing in additional airlines.
"It is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up.... It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country," Buffett added.
Buffett previously expressed grim sentiments about the financial outlook for airlines. He did invest in US Air in 1989.
"If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down," Buffett wrote in his 2007 annual letter. "Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it."

(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (N:BRKa) sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines in April, Chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company's annual meeting, saying "the world has changed" for the aviation industry.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The world's oldest central bank hits legal roadblock in economic crisis fight</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sweden's central bank may need to have some of its age-old laws changed if it's to act on a pledge to do "whatever it takes" to save the economy.
The Riksbank's 352-year history gives it the distinction of being the world's oldest central bank. But the legislation governing it has yet to catch up with the kind of policy it needs to deliver to address the crisis triggered by COVID-19.
Specifically, the Riksbank doesn't have the legal right to buy bonds issued by companies, even though it's made clear it's ready to do so as part of a recent package of emergency measures.
"The intention of the current Riksbank Act doesn't allow the bank to make outright purchases of corporate bonds or other private securities on the primary or secondary markets," said Niklas Schullerqvist, secretary to the parliamentary committee charged with overhauling the bank's policy framework.
So far the Stockholm-based central bank has bought 5.6 billion kronor ($890 million) of corporate commercial paper as part of an emergency quantitative-easing plan. But it's refrained from buying corporate bonds - an important source of financing in the biggest Nordic economy - despite repeated assurances it will so.
Schullerqvist says the Riksbank needs to consider European Union legislation on state aid as corporate bond purchases "may be considered supporting some specific parts of the economy."
Riksbank spokesman Tomas Lundberg said the bank's legal team is looking into the matter, but wouldn't comment further because "it's an ongoing process."
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves said purchases of investment-grade bonds are "certainly on our agenda." He also said "there are some legal issues when it comes to buying into the primary market."
Sweden's primary bond market is a vital source of funding for the country's businesses. And with record-low borrowing costs and a growing investor base flush with cash, the market's growth has increasingly shaped Sweden's economy.
But the market has been turned on its head since the COVID-19 crisis hit. Investors panicked and tried to redeem their cash, prompting 35 fixed-income funds to shut their doors. Even so, clients withdrew record quantities of cash and a spike in yields locked out all but a handful of top rated borrowers.
In April, Sweden's syndicated public bond market only saw corporate issuance from investment-grade companies such as Volvo, Industrivarden and Scania, as well as state-owned entities including Jernhusen, Akademiska Hus and Sveaskog.
The crisis that's hit Sweden's corporate bond market has drawn pleas from the investor community for the Riksbank to intervene before it's too late.
The Riksbank "should support new money rather than being very active in the secondary market," said Daniel Sachs, chief executive at credit manager Proventus Capital Management AB.
Magnus Nilsson, founding partner of Nordic Cross Asset Management, says that a "first step" toward making it easier for struggling businesses to access funding "would be for the Riksbank to get involved in the primary market for investment grade bonds."

    <h5 class="mb-1">World’s oldest central bank hits legal roadblock in crisis fight</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Love Liman and Rafaela Lindeberg
Sweden’s central bank may need to have some of its age-old laws changed if it’s to act on a pledge to do “whatever it takes” to save the economy.
The Riksbank’s 352-year history gives it the distinction of being the world’s oldest central bank. But the legislation governing it has yet to catch up with the kind of policy it needs to deliver to address the crisis triggered by Covid-19.
Specifically, the Riksbank doesn’t have the legal right to buy bonds issued by companies, even though it’s made clear it’s ready to do so as part of a recent package of emergency measures.
“The intention of the current Riksbank Act doesn’t allow the bank to make outright purchases of corporate bonds or other private securities on the primary or secondary markets,” said Niklas Schullerqvist, secretary to the parliamentary committee charged with overhauling the bank’s policy framework.
So far the Stockholm-based central bank has bought 5.6 billion kronor ($568 million) of corporate commercial paper as part of an emergency quantitative-easing plan. But it’s refrained from buying corporate bonds -- an important source of financing in the biggest Nordic economy -- despite repeated assurances it will so.
Schullerqvist says the Riksbank needs to consider European Union legislation on state aid as corporate bond purchases “may be considered supporting some specific parts of the economy.”
Riksbank spokesman Tomas Lundberg said the bank’s legal team is looking into the matter, but wouldn’t comment further because “it’s an ongoing process.”
Shape of Sweden’s Bond Market
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves said purchases of investment-grade bonds are “certainly on our agenda.” He also said “there are some legal issues when it comes to buying into the primary market.”
Sweden’s primary bond market is a vital source of funding for the country’s businesses. And with record-low borrowing costs and a growing investor base flush with cash, the market’s growth has increasingly shaped Sweden’s economy.
But the market has been turned on its head since the Covid-19 crisis hit. Investors panicked and tried to redeem their cash, prompting 35 fixed-income funds to shut their doors. Even so, clients withdrew record quantities of cash and a spike in yields locked out all but a handful of top rated borrowers.
In April, Sweden’s syndicated public bond market only saw corporate issuance from investment-grade companies such as Volvo Group, Industrivarden AB and Scania CV AB, as well as state-owned entities including Jernhusen AB, Akademiska Hus AB and Sveaskog AB.
The crisis that’s hit Sweden’s corporate bond market has drawn pleas from the investor community for the Riksbank to intervene before it’s too late.
The Riksbank “should support new money rather than being very active in the secondary market,” said Daniel Sachs, chief executive at credit manager Proventus Capital Management AB.
Magnus Nilsson, founding partner of Nordic Cross Asset Management, says that a “first step” toward making it easier for struggling businesses to access funding “would be for the Riksbank to get involved in the primary market for investment grade bonds.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sweden’s central bank may need to have some of its age-old laws changed if it’s to act on a pledge to do “whatever it takes” to save the economy.

Riksbank spokesman Tomas Lundberg said the bank’s legal team is looking into the matter, but wouldn’t comment further because “it’s an ongoing process.”
Meanwhile, a proposal due to be voted on by lawmakers may strip Sweden’s central bank of its right to do any form of quantitative easing beyond the purchase of government bonds.
According to the bank, “The proposed bill limits the Riksbank’s capacity to act, for instance by not allowing the Riksbank to purchase other securities than government papers, unless there are special reasons, or making lending to the banks conditional on them increasing their lending to companies. If this bill had applied now during the coronavirus pandemic, it would have limited the Riksbank’s monetary policy toolbox and it would have been unclear what the Riksbank was allowed to do.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett says the coronavirus cannot stop America, or Berkshire Hathaway</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday said the United States’ capacity to withstand crises provides a silver lining as it combats the coronavirus, even as he acknowledged that the global pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments.
Over more than 4-1/2 hours at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Buffett said his conglomerate has taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units, and throwing in the towel on a multi-billion-dollar bet on U.S. airlines.
Buffett also said he remains keen on making a big acquisition, which he has not done since 2016, but has not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.
The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska with 1-3/4 hours of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year’s bear market, even if the pandemic gets a second wind late this year.
Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, Buffett called dealing with the pandemic “quite an experiment” that had an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible economic outcomes.
But he said Americans have persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression. American “magic” prevailed before and would do again, he said.
“Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it,” Buffett said. “I will bet on America the rest of my life.”
The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo Finance.
Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly 2-1/2 hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.
Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.
BERKSHIRE EXITS AIRLINES
The meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75 billion first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealized losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America Corp and Apple Inc during the market meltdown.
While quarterly operating profit rose 6%, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, hurt by the negative impact of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Buffett said operating earnings will, through at least this year, be “considerably less” than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.
Berkshire’s cash stake ended the quarter at a record $137.3 billion, though Buffett said “we’re willing to do something very big,” perhaps a $30 billion to $50 billion transaction.
But it won’t be in U.S. airlines, after Buffett confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its “entire positions” in the four largest: American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Airlines Holdings Inc.
Buffett said he “made a mistake” investing in the sector, which the pandemic has changed “in a very major way” with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors.
“It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” he said.
The meeting was devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.”
ABEL SHARES THE STAGE
Abel stood in for longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Buffett to answer shareholder questions.
Buffett said Munger was in “fine shape” and “good health,” and looked forward to attending Berkshire’s 2021 annual meeting.
Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire’s insurance businesses and is also considered a possible CEO candidate, was also absent from the meeting. Abel lives closer to Omaha than Munger and Jain.
Berkshire has said its board of directors knows who would become CEO if Buffett died or became incapacitated.
Buffett’s eldest son Howard would likely become non-executive chairman, and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler could succeed Buffett as chief investment officer.
Abel told investors “I don’t see the culture of Berkshire changing” after Buffett and Munger are no longer there.
He also said Berkshire was likely to expand its workforce, which totaled 391,539 people at year end, even though some businesses have furloughed employees and cut salaries since the pandemic began, and could start resorting to layoffs.
Berkshire wouldn’t be alone. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totaled about 30.3 million, or 18% of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.
Abel nonetheless said that in five years, “we see our employment numbers being far greater than they are today.”
Shareholders also elected Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of longtime Berkshire holding American Express Co , to Berkshire’s board, making him the company’s first African American director.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett says COVID-19 won't stop America, or Berkshire Hathaway</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York | Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says the United States' capacity to withstand crises provides a silver lining as it combats the coronavirus, even as he acknowledges the global pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments.
Over more than four hours at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday (Sunday AEST), Mr Buffett said his conglomerate had taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units and throwing in the towel on a multibillion-dollar bet on US airlines.
He remained keen on making a big acquisition, which he had not done since 2016, but had not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.
The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, with nearly two hours of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year's bear market, even if the pandemic got a second wind late this year.
Mr Buffett called dealing with the pandemic "quite an experiment" that had an "extraordinarily wide" range of possible economic outcomes.
But he said Americans had persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression. American "magic" prevailed before and would do again.
"Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it," Mr Buffett said. "I will bet on America the rest of my life."
The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo Finance.
Mr Buffett and vice-chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly two hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.
Mr Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire's non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Mr Buffett as chief executive.
The meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $US49.75 billion ($77.41 billion) first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealised losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America and Apple during the market meltdown.
While quarterly operating profit rose 6 per cent, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, hurt by the negative impact of COVID-19.
Mr Buffett said operating earnings would, through at least this year, be "considerably less" than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.
Berkshire's cash stake ended the quarter at a record $US137.3 billion, though Mr Buffett said "we're willing to do something very big", perhaps a $US30 billion to $US50 billion transaction.
But it will not be in US airlines, after Mr Buffett confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its "entire positions" in the four largest: American Airlines Group, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines Holdings.
He said he "made a mistake" investing in the sector, which the pandemic had changed "in a very major way" with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors.
"It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country," he said.
The meeting was devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Mr Buffett calls "Woodstock for capitalists".
Mr Abel stood in for long-time vice-chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Mr Buffett to answer shareholder questions.
Mr Buffett said Mr Munger was in "fine shape" and "good health", and looked forward to attending Berkshire's 2021 annual meeting.
Vice-chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire's insurance businesses and is also considered a possible CEO candidate, was also absent from the meeting. Mr Abel lives closer to Omaha than Mr Munger and Mr Jain.
Berkshire has said its board of directors knows who would become CEO if Mr Buffett died or became incapacitated.
Mr Buffett's eldest son, Howard, would likely become non-executive chairman, and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler could succeed Mr Buffett as chief investment officer.
Mr Abel told investors "I don't see the culture of Berkshire changing" after Mr Buffett and Mr Munger were no longer there.
He also said Berkshire was likely to expand its workforce, which totalled 391,539 at year end, though some businesses had furloughed employees and cut salaries since the pandemic began and could start resorting to layoffs.
Berkshire would not be alone. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totalled about 30.3 million, or 18 per cent of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.
Mr Abel nonetheless said that in five years, "we see our employment numbers being far greater than they are today".
Shareholders also elected Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of long-time Berkshire holding American Express, to Berkshire's board, making him the company's first African American director.

Buffett said operating earnings will, through at least this year, be "considerably less" than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oil-hungry Asian nations pounce on low prices to build stockpiles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SINGAPORE – Some oil-hungry Asian nations are taking advantage of the collapse in prices caused by the coronavirus pandemic to build up their crude stockpiles.
Here are some questions and answers about strategic reserves and the region's oil supplies:
What are strategic oil reserves and why do countries need them?
Strategic reserves are stockpiles of oil and other fuels held by governments in secure storage facilities to cover unexpected disruptions to energy supplies.
Major economies such as the United States, China, and Russia began to build up reserves after oil shocks in the 1970s, according to Ravi Krishnaswamy, regional senior vice president for energy and environment at consultancy Frost & Sullivan.
The events that spurred them to take action were principally the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Israel and the Arab nations, and the 1979 Iranian revolution, which fuelled worries about supplies.
How big are the strategic reserves across the region?
China is believed to have the biggest in the Asia-Pacific. Beijing does not give an official estimate, but analysts say it is at around 550 million barrels. In comparison, the United States' strategic reserves currently hold around 630 million.
State-owned China National Petroleum Corporation said recently that the country's reserves were "obviously insufficient, and have not yet reached the international standard '90-day safety line.'"
The International Energy Agency requires its members to hold emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net oil imports. China is an associate member, but not a full member.
Japan's oil reserves were around 500 million barrels at the end of February, equivalent to national consumption for more than 7 months, according to the latest official data, while South Korea had around 96 million barrels in strategic reserves as of December 2019, enough for 89 days.
India, by contrast, has reserves with storage capacity of approximately 40 million barrels – which would last just 10 days in the country of 1.3 billion people.
How are reserves stored?
Strategic reserves are stored largely in secure underground depots like natural rock caverns. The US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest supply of emergency crude, is stored in huge underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast.
But building underground storage is challenging as it needs to have the right geological formation, and countries also need to build infrastructure to pump oil in and out.
The high cost of building reserves has stopped many countries developing them to sufficient levels.
In Asia, India uses caverns to store its reserves but other countries, such as Japan, put theirs in aboveground tanks.
Which Asian countries are pouncing on low prices to build up stockpiles?
Australia, which has long had one of the lowest levels of emergency stockpiles in the developed world, said it will take advantage of the fall in prices to develop a strategic reserve in the US.
The country's own storage capacity is already full, but it has an agreement with the US allowing it to lease space in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
In China, the Shanghai International Energy Exchange last month gave approval for state-owned Sinopec Petroleum Reserve to add more storage capacity.
One storage depot in southern Guangdong province can hold up to 600,000 cubic meters (3.8 million barrels), while another in northern Hebei province can hold up to one million cubic meters.
India's Ministry of Petroleum tweeted on April 15 it was buying crude to fill its reserves, stored in rock caverns, "to their full capacity."
Madhu Nainan, editor of industry publication PetroWatch, however, questioned whether the country had enough available storage space to build up capacity quickly.
"In India, storage tanks and pipelines are full and dealers' tanks are full," he told Agence France-Presse (AFP).
Japan and South Korea, with ample stockpiles, have not announced plans to build up their reserves substantially.
A Japanese trade ministry official said current levels were sufficient, while Seoul plans to increase stockpiles by less than 1% this year.
Could low prices boost the region's economies when lockdowns are lifted?
It looks unlikely, in the short term at least. Many observers believe economic activity won't bounce back quickly with the gradual lifting of lockdowns but only when a vaccine for the virus is discovered – which could be some time away.
"Low oil prices won't turbocharge Asian economic recovery," Jeffrey Halley, OANDA senior market analyst, told AFP.
Are there any winners from low prices?
Major oil importers in Asia – such as China, Japan, and South Korea – would in usual times benefit from low prices, but this is unlikely to be the case immediately given the economic devastation caused by the pandemic.
In Japan, for example, "the price crash has hit financial markets hard, which is negatively affecting the Japanese economy," said Toshihiro Nagahama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
"We can't apply our usual framework to this unprecedented period."
Some economists, however, expect oil prices to stay low for a long period, meaning major importers could eventually emerge winners.
"Oil prices are expected to remain low to some extent when the post-corona era comes, and given the current situation, it will have a positive effect on [South Korea's] economy in terms of recovery," said Jung Jun-hwan, a researcher at the Korea Energy Economics Institute.
There are also "obvious losers" in Asia, such as oil exporters Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei, said OANDA's Halley. – Rappler.com

The country's own storage capacity is already full but it has an agreement with the US allowing it to lease space in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
In China, the Shanghai International Energy Exchange last month gave approval for state-owned Sinopec Petroleum Reserve to add more storage capacity.
One storage depot in southern Guangdong province can hold up to 600,000 cubic metres (3.8 million barrels), while another in northern Hebei province can hold up to one million cubic metres.
India's Ministry of Petroleum tweeted on April 15 it was buying crude to fill its reserves, stored in rock caverns, "to their full capacity".
Madhu Nainan, editor of industry publication PetroWatch, however, questioned whether the country had enough available storage space to build up capacity quickly.
"In India, storage tanks and pipelines are full and dealers' tanks are full," he told AFP.
Japan and South Korea, with ample stockpiles, have not announced plans to build up their reserves substantially.
A Japanese trade ministry official said current levels were sufficient, while Seoul plans to increase stockpiles by less than one percent this year.
- Could low prices boost the region's economies when lockdowns are lifted? -
It looks unlikely, in the short term at least. Many observers believe economic activity won't bounce back quickly with the gradual lifting of lockdowns but only when a vaccine for the virus is discovered -- which could be some time away.
"Low oil prices won't turbocharge Asian economic recovery," Jeffrey Halley, OANDA senior market analyst, told AFP.
- Are there any winners from low prices? -
Major oil-importers in Asia -- such as China, Japan and South Korea -- would in usual times benefit from low prices but this is unlikely to be the case immediately given the economic devastation caused by the pandemic.
In Japan, for example, "the price crash has hit financial markets hard, which is negatively affecting the Japanese economy", said Toshihiro Nagahama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
"We can't apply our usual framework to this unprecedented period."
Some economists, however, expect oil prices to stay low for a long period, meaning major importers could eventually emerge winners.
"Oil prices are expected to remain low to some extent when the post-corona era comes, and given the current situation, it will have a positive effect on (South Korea's) economy in terms of recovery," said Jung Jun-hwan, a researcher at the Korea Energy Economics Institute.
There are also "obvious losers" in Asia, such as oil exporters Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei, said OANDA's Halley.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oil-hungry Asian nations pounce on low prices to build stockpiles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Some oil-hungry Asian nations are taking advantage of the collapse in prices caused by the coronavirus pandemic to build up their crude stockpiles.
Here are some questions and answers about strategic reserves and the region's oil supplies:
Strategic reserves are stockpiles of oil and other fuels held by governments in secure storage facilities to cover unexpected disruptions to energy supplies.
Major economies such as the US, China and Russia began to build up reserves after oil shocks in the 1970s, according to Ravi Krishnaswamy, regional senior vice president for energy and environment at consultancy Frost & Sullivan.
The events that spurred them to take action were principally the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Israel and the Arab nations, and the 1979 Iranian revolution, which fuelled worries about supplies.
China is believed to have the biggest in the Asia-Pacific. Beijing does not give an official estimate but analysts say it is at around 550 million barrels. In comparison, the United States' strategic reserves currently hold around 630 million.
State-owned China National Petroleum Corporation said recently that the country's reserves were "obviously insufficient, and have not yet reached the international standard '90-day safety line'".
The International Energy Agency requires its members to hold emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net oil imports. China is an associate member, but not a full member.
Japan's oil reserves were around 500 million barrels at the end of February, equivalent to national consumption for more than seven months, according to the latest official data, while South Korea had around 96 million barrels in strategic reserves as of December 2019, enough for 89 days.
India, by contrast, has reserves with storage capacity of approximately 40 million barrels -- which would last just 10 days in the country of 1.3 billion people.
Strategic reserves are stored largely in secure underground depots like natural rock caverns. The US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest supply of emergency crude, is stored in huge underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast.
But building underground storage is challenging as it needs to have the right geological formation, and countries also need to build infrastructure to pump oil in and out.
The high cost of building reserves has stopped many countries developing them to sufficient levels.
In Asia, India uses caverns to store its reserves but other countries, such as Japan, put theirs in above-ground tanks.
Australia, which has long had one of the lowest levels of emergency stockpiles in the developed world, said it will take advantage of the fall in prices to develop a strategic reserve in the United States.
The country's own storage capacity is already full but it has an agreement with the US allowing it to lease space in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffet Sells Full Slate of U.S. Airlines Investments</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has sold its entire holdings in U.S. airlines in the wake of the coronavirus that has led to a virtual standstill of the industry and revenue losses in the billions.
Buffet revealed the news to shareholders on Saturday, according to a Reuters report, which included that the conglomerate had some $7 to $8 billion invested in the airline industry:
“We made that decision in terms of the airline business,” Buffet said. “We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss. We will not fund a company that — where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future.”
Bershire had already sold 18 percent of its Delta stake and four percent of Southwest shares, it announced on April 3.
“We did not take out anything like $7 or $8 billion and that was my mistake,” Buffett said at the company’s virtual annual meeting. “I am the one who made the decision.”
“Buffett previously expressed grim sentiments about the financial outlook for airlines,” Reuters reported. “He did invest in USAir in 1989.”
“If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down,” Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders in 2007. “Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett: 'American magic' will spur US economic recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire investor Warren Buffet said Saturday he's confident the US economy will bounce back from its pummeling by the coronavirus pandemic because "American magic has always prevailed".
The 89-year-old made the sanguine prediction about the world's largest economy as his holding company Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter net losses of nearly $50 billion.
Buffett also announced Saturday that his company had sold all its stakes in four major US airlines last month, as the pandemic clobbered the travel industry.
"It turns out I was wrong," he said of his acquisitions of 10 percent stakes in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.
Berkshire Hathaway had paid $7 billion to $8 billion, and "we did not take out anything like that," he said.
Between the purchases that took place over months, and the sale, "the airlines business I think changed in a very major way" and could no longer meet Berkshire criteria for profitability, he said.
Buffett's announcement may further hurt airlines already pushed to the brink by coronavirus lockdown measures, now looking to the US government for $25 billion in relief funds.
'American miracles, American magic'
Berkshire Hathaway, based in Omaha, Nebraska, called its first-quarter setback "temporary" but said it could not reliably predict when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
"We've faced great problems in the past, haven't faced this exact problem -- in fact we haven't really faced anything that quite resembles this problem," Buffett said in a lengthy speech on the country's economic history.
"But we faced tougher problems, and the American miracles, American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again." 
"We are now a better country, as well as an incredibly more wealthy country, than we were in 1789... We got a long ways to go but we moved in the right direction," he said, referencing the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage.
"Never bet against America."
Buffett is considered one of the savviest investors anywhere. His fortune of $72 billion is the fourth-largest in the world, according to Forbes, and in normal years, the company's annual gathering in Omaha is a high-point of the calendar for investors, a "Woodstock for capitalists."
But the devastating economic impact of the pandemic has hit hard at Berkshire Hathaway's wide range of investments, and the need for social distancing forced it to hold the annual meeting online.
Buffett addressed his shareholders in a livestream flanked only by Gregory Abel, who is in charge of Berkshire's non-insurance operations. 
His business partner for six decades, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not appear.
Growth by one measure
Buffett, in a statement, played down his company's bleak-looking net figure. He said a better measure of the company's performance was its operating earnings, which exclude investments and are less subject to sharp fluctuations.
By that measure, Berkshire Hathaway saw growth to $5.9 billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier. 
The brutal drop in the net -- to a loss of $49.75 billion from a profit last year of $21.7 billion -- resulted primarily from the virus-related decline in value of its broad investment portfolio, which ranges from energy to transport to insurance and technology.
The annual meeting often has an almost carnival atmosphere, as thousands of fans and investors flock to Nebraska to hear from the celebrated "Oracle of Omaha." Buffett, famous for his relatively modest lifestyle, turns 90 on August 30.
In documents filed Saturday, Berkshire noted that until mid-March many of its companies were posting "comparative revenue and earnings increases" over the same 2019 period.
Many of its companies -- including in rail transport, energy production and some manufacturing and service businesses -- are deemed essential and are able to continue working amid the far-reaching confinement orders.
But their turnover slowed considerably in April, the company statement said.
Moves taken by those companies such as employee furloughs, salary cuts and reductions, and capital spending reductions are "necessary actions" and "temporary," it said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sells entire stake in US airlines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has sold its stakes in the four largest U.S. airline companies, Warren Buffett, the owner of the conglomerate holding company, told shareholders on Saturday. 
Berkshire Hathaway held an 11 percent stake in Delta Air Lines, 10 percent of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, and 9 percent of United Airlines, making it one of the largest holders in those companies, according to Reuters. The company had invested around $7 billion or $8 billion in the four companies, Buffett said. 
Citing the outbreak of the novel coronavirus and what it's done to demand for air travel, Buffett said that he decided to sell those stakes because he concluded he'd made a "mistake in valuing." 
"We took money out of the business, basically, even at a substantial loss," Buffett said. "We will not fund a company ... where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future."
"The airline business — and I may be wrong, and I hope I'm wrong — I think it changed in a very major way, and it's obviously changed in the fact that their four companies are each going to borrow perhaps average of at least $10 [billion] or $12 billion each," he added. 
Airlines around the world have experienced a substantial financial hit in recent months as planes stay grounded due to a rapid drop in demand. American Airlines reported a first-quarter net loss of $2.2 billion. United Airlines said its net loss was $1.7 billion. 
Buffett's holding company also reported a loss of nearly $50 billion during the first quarter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. He expressed optimism about the U.S.'s ability to recover economically during the shareholder meeting, saying, "The American miracle, the American magic has always prevailed, and it will do so again."
At the same time, he voiced concerns about the U.S. airline industry and its ability to recover to pre-pandemic levels. 
"I don't know whether two or three years from now that as many people will fly as many passenger miles as they did," he said. 
The Trump administration and the major U.S. airlines reached an agreement last month on a $25 billion bailout to help companies weather a sudden drop in revenue. The program, which was created as part of the coronavirus stimulus package signed by President Trump in March, is intended to help the airlines pay staff.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire investor Warren Buffet said Saturday he's confident the US economy will bounce back from its pummeling by the coronavirus pandemic because "American magic has always prevailed."
The 89-year-old made the sanguine prediction about the world's largest economy as his holding company Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter net losses of nearly $50 billion.
Buffett also announced Saturday that his company had sold all its stakes in four major US airlines last month, as the pandemic clobbered the travel industry.
"It turns out I was wrong," he said of his acquisitions of 10 percent stakes in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.
Berkshire Hathaway had paid $7 billion to $8 billion, and "we did not take out anything like that," he said.
Between the purchases that took place over months, and the sale, "the airlines business I think changed in a very major way" and could no longer meet Berkshire criteria for profitability, he said.
Buffett's announcement may further hurt airlines already pushed to the brink by coronavirus lockdown measures, now looking to the US government for $25 billion in relief funds.
Berkshire Hathaway, based in Omaha, Nebraska, called its first-quarter setback "temporary" but said it could not reliably predict when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
"We've faced great problems in the past, haven't faced this exact problem -- in fact we haven't really faced anything that quite resembles this problem," Buffett said in a lengthy speech on the country's economic history.
"But we faced tougher problems, and the American miracles, American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again."
"We are now a better country, as well as an incredibly more wealthy country, than we were in 1789... We got a long ways to go but we moved in the right direction," he said, referencing the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage.
"Never bet against America."
Buffett is considered one of the savviest investors anywhere. His fortune of $72 billion is the fourth-largest in the world, according to Forbes, and in normal years, the company's annual gathering in Omaha is a high-point of the calendar for investors, a "Woodstock for capitalists."
But the devastating economic impact of the pandemic has hit hard at Berkshire Hathaway's wide range of investments, and the need for social distancing forced it to hold the annual meeting online.
Buffett addressed his shareholders in a livestream flanked only by Gregory Abel, who is in charge of Berkshire's non-insurance operations.
His business partner for six decades, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not appear.
Buffett, in a statement, played down his company's bleak-looking net figure. He said a better measure of the company's performance was its operating earnings, which exclude investments and are less subject to sharp fluctuations.
By that measure, Berkshire Hathaway saw growth to $5.9 billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier.
The brutal drop in the net -- to a loss of $49.75 billion from a profit last year of $21.7 billion -- resulted primarily from the virus-related decline in value of its broad investment portfolio, which ranges from energy to transport to insurance and technology.
The annual meeting often has an almost carnival atmosphere, as thousands of fans and investors flock to Nebraska to hear from the celebrated "Oracle of Omaha." Buffett, famous for his relatively modest lifestyle, turns 90 on August 30.
In documents filed Saturday, Berkshire noted that until mid-March many of its companies were posting "comparative revenue and earnings increases" over the same 2019 period.
Many of its companies -- including in rail transport, energy production and some manufacturing and service businesses -- are deemed essential and are able to continue working amid the far-reaching confinement orders.
But their turnover slowed considerably in April, the company statement said.
Moves taken by those companies such as employee furloughs, salary cuts and reductions, and capital spending reductions are "necessary actions" and "temporary," it said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway sells US airline shares</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says his company Berkshire Hathaway has sold all of its shares in the four largest US airlines.
Speaking at the annual shareholders' meeting, Mr Buffett said "the world has changed" because of the coronavirus.
He then said he had been wrong to invest in the airline industry.
Mr Buffett's comments came just hours after Berkshire Hathaway announced a record $50bn (£40bn) net first quarter loss, Reuters news agency reports.
The conglomerate had an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines, 10% of American Airlines, 10% of Southwest Airlines, and 9% of United Airlines, according to its annual report and company filings.
The firm began investing in the four airlines in 2016, after avoiding the aviation industry for years.
Mr Buffett told the meeting, which was held virtually: "We made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss.
"We will not fund a company that... where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future."
The US travel industry has almost collapsed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with airlines cutting hundreds of thousands of flights and taking thousands of planes out of service.
Mr Buffett said he had been considering investing in additional airlines before the pandemic hit.
"It is a blow to have, essentially, your demand dry up," he said. "It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country."
In a statement, Delta said it was aware of the sale and has "tremendous respect for Mr Buffett and the Berkshire team".
The airline added that it remains "confident" in its strengths.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Billionaire Warren Buffett dumps airline stocks as Berkshire Hathaway posts $US50b loss</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire US investor Warren Buffett said his company Berkshire Hathaway completely exited its stakes in the four major US airlines, as the coronavirus pandemic pushed the vaunted investment firm to $US49.7 billion ($77 billion) quarterly loss.
The sales of shares of Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and United Airlines made up most of the company's $US6.5 billion in equity sales in April.
During his live-streamed annual meeting, Buffett said the business has fundamentally changed following the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. He declined to blame the performance of the airline executives, saying they've done a good job of raising money to get through the crisis.
"The world changed for airlines and I wish them well," Buffett said Saturday. He clarified that he made the decision and that he lost money on his investments. "That was my mistake."
Buffett's had a complicated relationship with the airline industry over the years. After a troublesome investment in USAir, Buffett joked that he would call an 800 number to declare he was an "air-o-holic" if he ever got the urge to invest in airlines again.
Then in 2016, Berkshire dove into the industry again, amassing stakes in the four largest US airlines. At the end of 2019, those stakes amounted to almost $US10 billion. Buffett's renewed faith in the industry prompted speculation that he might one day own one of the carriers.
But now, he's cut those investments again. Berkshire disclosed in April that it had at least trimmed its Delta and Southwest stakes, both of which had previously been above a 10 per cent ownership level.
"The airline business - and I may be wrong and I hope I'm wrong - but I think it's changed in a very major way," Buffett said. "The future is much less clear to me."
The disclosure was among the most significant at the annual meeting, which was notable for its different feel this year as the event that usually draws tens of thousands was done was hosted virtually. Buffett, 89, shared the stage with a top deputy, Greg Abel, who runs Berkshire's non-insurance operating units.
Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, didn't join, though Buffett said his longtime business partner was in good health.
Buffett said he didn't know how consumer travel habits will change after the pandemic subsides, but any reduction in travel could leave airlines with higher-than-necessary fixed costs. Any impact could filter down to suppliers like Boeing Co.
"The real question is whether you need a lot of new planes or not," he said.
Buffett said the efforts to slow the pandemic amounted to "quite an experiment," and while the range of public health and economic outcomes has narrowed, they remain "enormous."
"I don't know the consequences" of shutting down large parts of the US economy, Buffett said, though Berkshire's operating earnings will be "considerably less" than if the virus hadn't hit.
Buffett gave an extended history lesson to back up his assertion that "nothing basically can stop America." He said he's still bullish on the US economy because it has overcome many obstacles over the past two centuries, though "we haven't faced anything that quite resembles this."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett discussed coronavirus, the economy, and stocks at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting. Here are the highlights.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett discussed a range of topics at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday, famously described as “Woodstock for capitalists.”
The famed investor and Berkshire CEO, along with Greg Abel, vice chairman of non-insurance operations, hosted the virtual event and answers questioned posed by journalists.
The pair spoke hours after Berkshire released its first-quarter earnings. The company posted a record quarterly loss of about $50 billion, largely due to $55 billion in investment losses. It also grew its cash pile from $128 billion to $137 billion in the period, and sold about $6.1 billion in stock on a net basis in April, upending expectations that it would capitalize on the coronavirus sell-off and buy stocks on the cheap.
Here are the highlights from the Berkshire annual meeting:
Buffett opened the meeting by explaining the absence of Charlie Munger, his longtime partner.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett discussed bailouts, coronavirus, and selling airline stocks at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting. Here are the highlights.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett held forth on airlines, buybacks, bailouts, coronavirus, the US economy, oil prices, and other topics at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday, often described as "Woodstock for capitalists."
The famed investor and Berkshire CEO, along with Greg Abel, vice chairman of non-insurance operations, hosted the virtual event and answered several questions. The event was livestreamed by Yahoo Finance.
The pair spoke hours after Berkshire released its first-quarter earnings. The company posted a record quarterly net loss of about $50 billion, largely due to $55 billion in investment losses.
It also grew its cash pile from $128 billion to $137 billion in the period, and sold about $6.1 billion in stock on a net basis in April, upending expectations that it would capitalize on the coronavirus sell-off and buy stocks on the cheap.

Here are the highlights from the Berkshire annual meeting:
Buffett opened the meeting by lamenting the absence of Charlie Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman and his longtime partner.
"Charlie is in fine shape, his mind is as good as ever, his voice is as strong as ever," he said. It "just didn't seem like a good idea" for the 96-year-old to fly from his California home to attend the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.
"He's added Zoom to his repertoire," Buffett continued, referring to the video-conferencing app. "He's just skipped right by me technologically. Like stepping over a peanut."
Buffett discussed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
"It's been a flip of the switch in a huge way in terms of national behavior, the national psyche, it's dramatic," he said.
"There was an extraordinarily wide variety of possibilities on both the health side and the economic side," Buffett continued. A few months on, it's become clear that "we're not getting a best case and we know we're not getting a worst case."
"The range of possibilities is still extraordinarily wide," Buffett continued. "We do not know what exactly happens when you shut down a substantial portion of your society."
Whereas the US economy went off the tracks in the 2008 financial crisis, Buffett said, "This time we just pulled the train off the tracks and put it on its siding."

Buffett offered historical context for the current disruption by reflecting on the Great Depression. He pointed out that someone who invested on the day of his birth in August 1930 needed to wait more than 20 years to make back their money.
He also discussed the challenges that his father faced at that time, when he had no job and two children to feed, but couldn't access his savings as the bank was closed.
"Don't worry about your groceries," Buffett's grandfather, who owned a grocery store where Buffett and Munger worked as children, told his father. "I'll let your bill run."
"He cared about his family, but he wasn't going to go crazy," Buffett joked.
When the Dow Jones passed the 381 mark in the 1950s, he said, investors feared the market was overheated and it was going to be 1929 again. Buffett's mentor and boss at the time, Benjamin Graham, was called to Washington along with a slew of other experts to assess whether the US economy was in trouble.
Now, the Dow is above 24,000. "You're looking at a market today that has produced $100 for every $1," Buffett said. "Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it."
"We are now a better country as well as an incredibly more wealthy country than we were in 1789," the next slide read. "We have gone dramatically in the right direction," Buffett said.

Buffett applied his optimistic outlook to the pandemic threat. He also underlined his company's commitment to funding its own operations, and warned against the dangers of debt.
"When something like the current pandemic happens, it's hard to factor that in and that's why you never want to use borrowed money to buy into investments," he said. "We run Berkshire that way."
"There's no reason to use borrowed money to participate in the American tailwind," he added.
Buffett also trumpeted the merits of stocks.
Equities are an "enormously sound investment," he said, that will outperform US Treasuries and the money people have stashed under their mattresses over time.
Buffett also discouraged people from selling stocks purely because their prices change.
"If you owned the businesses you liked prior to the virus arriving, it changed prices, but nobody's forcing you to sell."
The Berkshire boss recommended "the best thing" for investors to bet on is the S&P 500 index, as it gives them a broad cross-section of American businesses.
"I will bet on America the rest of my life," Buffett said. "I hope I've convinced you to bet on America."

Buffett described the impact of coronavirus on Berkshire's numerous companies.
"For some period, certainly during the balance of the year ... our operating earnings will be considerably less than if the virus hadn't come along," he said. "It hurts some of our businesses a lot."
While Berkshire's three biggest businesses — insurance, the BNSF railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy — are in a "reasonably decent" position," Buffett said, other businesses have been "effectively shut down."
Buffett also defended the company's vast cash reserves.
"We don't want to be dependent on the kindness of friends even," Buffett said, let alone strangers. "There are times when money almost stops," he added, pointing to the 2008 financial crisis and the liquidity crunch just over a month ago.
"Investment-grade companies were essentially going to be frozen out of the market" in late March, Buffett said, before the Federal Reserve "reacted in a huge way."
"Fear is the most contagious disease you can imagine, makes the virus look like a piker," he added, using a term for a gambler who only makes small bets.
Buffett shed some light on Berkshire's stock-market activity in recent months. "We did very little in the first quarter," he said.
However, he pointed to Berkshire's sales of $6.1 billion in stocks on a net basis in April, and explained that figure reflected its exit from positions in the "big four" US airlines.
"It turned out I was wrong," Buffett said about his bets on American, Delta, United, and Southwest. He explained that the airline business has "changed in a very major way."
The investor questioned whether people would fly as much in the next two or three years as they did last year. Even if 70% or 80% of the airline business returns, he said, the carriers could end up with "too many planes."
Later, he added that an oversupply of airline seats would drive down prices, and it was unclear how long the airlines would have to sustain billions of dollars in operating losses due to the pandemic.
Moreover, they will have to repay their recent loans from the government out of their earnings, he said. The carriers also agreed to hand over warrants that the Treasury can exercise to buy their shares at a discount in the future then sell them for a profit, potentially weighing on their stock prices down the line.
"The future is much less clear to me," Buffett said about the airline business.
Buffett addressed the question of whether Berkshire would be bailing out companies as it did during the financial crisis. He said that the Fed's speed in lending to struggling companies meant there was less need for Berkshire's cash this time around, and the right opportunity was yet to come its way.
"We haven't done anything because we don't see anything that attractive to do," Buffett said. However, there was some early interest, he added.
"There was a period right before the Fed acted," the investor said. "We were getting calls. A number of them were able to get money in the public market, frankly at terms that we wouldn't have given them."
Buffett and Abel added that none of Berkshire's fully owned businesses have applied for government aid.
Buffett detailed the tough situation at See's Candies, the Berkshire-owned chocolate maker that he's described as his "dream business."
"We were in the midst of our Easter season, and Easter is a big sales period for See's," he said. "See's business stopped and it's a very seasonal business to start with. We have a lot of Easter candy. Easter candy's kind of specialized too, we won't sell it."
He also acknowledged that not all of Berkshire's businesses will last, giving the example of Blue Chip Stamps, a trading stamps company that he invested in back in the 1970s.
Buffett tackled the topic of Berkshire's underperformance versus the S&P 500 in recent years.
"The truth is I recommend the S&P 500 to people," he said. "Berkshire is about as sound as any single investment can be in terms of earning reasonable returns over time, but I would not want to bet my life on whether we beat the S&P 500 over the next 10 years."
While Berkshire's sheer scale makes it difficult to beat the broader market, Buffett said, it has some upsides.
"We're better positioned than anyone in the energy business," he said, citing the fact it doesn't have to pay dividends. "We can do things in insurance that nobody else can do."
Buffett lauded Ajit Jain, Berkshire's vice chairman of insurance operations.
He praised his intelligence, revealing that he wrote to Jain's father a few years after he joined Berkshire to say, "If you've got another son like this, send him over from India, and we'll rule the world."
Buffett weighed in on the plunge in oil prices in recent weeks. He defended his $10 billion investment in Occidental Petroleum, saying "it was attractive at oil prices that then prevailed." Now, he continued, "it does not pay to drill."
"Any shareholder in any oil-producing company, you join me in having made a mistake so far in where oil prices went," Buffett added. "Who knows where they go in the future." 
If oil prices remain low, he continued, at least some energy companies are likely to default on their loans, hurting their shareholders and causing headaches for the banking industry.
"There's going to be a whole lot of money [lost]," Buffett said.
Buffett considered the prospect of negative interest rates as central banks around the world cut rates to almost zero in order to stimulate their economies.
"Probably the most interesting question that I've seen in economics," he said.
"We're doing things that we don't know [their] ultimate outcome," Buffett continued, warning of "extreme consequences."
The puzzle of what negative rates would do to US financial markets is "the most important question in the world," he said in March. "And I don't know the answer."
Buffett doubled down on his defense of buybacks as an efficient way of distributing cash to shareholders. The practice is facing fresh criticism after the "big four" airlines repurchased billions' worth of their stock in recent years, then clamored for government aid when they were caught short of cash by the coronavirus outbreak.
"It's very politically correct to be against buybacks," Buffett said. "There's a lot of crazy things said on buybacks."
While he's witnessed some cases of "stupid" buybacks, they aren't immoral, he added.
Buffett answered a question about why Berkshire didn't repurchase more of its shares when they plunged in late March.
The investor seemed to suggest that Berkshire's intrinsic value fell roughly in line with its stock price during the market meltdown.
"I don't feel that it's far more compelling to buy Berkshire shares now than I did three months or six months or a year ago," Buffett said.
"Berkshire is worth less today because I took that position than if I hadn't," he said about its airline investments.
Buffett praised the Paycheck Protection Program, the government initiative to loan money to small businesses to help them weather the pandemic.
"It's a very good idea to take care of the people that are having terrible trouble taking care of themselves," Buffett said. He expected some amount of fraud, but gave "real credit" to Congress for acting promptly to help the millions of people left jobless by the outbreak.
Comedian Bill Murray submitted a similar question about how the country would reward the grocery-store cashiers, delivery drivers, warehouse workers, and others who will make up "a new class of war veterans."
"It's like people that landed in Normandy," Buffett said. "The poor, the disadvantaged, there's an unimaginable suffering. They're working 24-hour days and we don't even know their names."
"We ought to do something that can help those people," he added, referring more broadly to Americans struggling to make ends meet. "Nobody should be left behind."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett's Berkshire posts nearly $50 billion loss as coronavirus causes pain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc is being hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, posting a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50 billion on Saturday and saying performance is suffering in several major operating businesses.
Berkshire said most of its more than 90 businesses are facing “relatively minor to severe” negative effects from COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus and now punishing the global economy, with revenue slowing considerably in April even at businesses deemed “essential.”
The BNSF railroad saw shipping volumes of consumer products and coal fall, while Geico set aside money for car insurance premiums it no longer expects to collect. Some businesses cut salaries and furloughed workers, and retailers such as See’s Candies and the Nebraska Furniture Mart closed stores.
Buffett also allowed Berkshire’s cash stake to rise to a record $137.3 billion from $128 billion at the end of 2019.
That reflected the 89-year-old billionaire’s inability to make large, “elephant” size acquisitions for his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, and caution in buying stocks.
Berkshire said it bought only a net $1.8 billion of stocks in the first quarter. It also said it repurchased $1.7 billion of its own stock, but that was less than in the prior quarter.
“Historically, Buffett has been so visible in times of crisis, and encouraged investors to take advantage of market selloffs, but if he doesn’t see opportunities even in his own stock, what are we to think?” said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co in St. Louis.
Still, Shanahan said Berkshire is “as well positioned as it can be,” reflecting its diverse businesses and substantial liquidity and access to capital. He rates Berkshire “buy.”
Berkshire released results before its annual meeting, where Buffett said Berkshire in April sold its “entire positions” in the four largest U.S. airlines: American, Delta, Southwest and United.
Buffett said Berkshire “made a mistake” investing approximately $7 billion to $8 billion in the sector, which was changed “in a very major way” as the pandemic shut down most air travel, through no fault of the airlines.
The meeting was streamed on Yahoo Finance. It was held without the usual “Woodstock for Capitalists,” a weekend of festivities that normally draws tens of thousands of people to Omaha, and which Buffett canceled because of the pandemic.
Berkshire’s first-quarter net loss was $49.75 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, reflecting $54.52 billion of losses on stock and other investments. Net earnings were $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per share, a year earlier.
An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized stock losses and gains with net results, causing huge swings that Buffett considers meaningless.
Quarterly operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 6% to $5.87 billion, or about $3,624 per Class A share, from $5.56 billion, or about $3,388 per share.
But year-earlier results reflected a charge for investments linked to what prosecutors called a Ponzi scheme at a solar company, which Berkshire did not know about.
Operating profit at Berkshire’s businesses fell 3%, with declines at BNSF, utilities and energy units, and manufacturing, service and retailing operations such as Precision Castparts, which Berkshire bought for $32.1 billion in 2016.
Geico was able to post a 28% gain in pre-tax underwriting profit because people drove less, resulting in fewer claims for crashes. Still, the insurer, like others, is offering relief on premiums to policyholders.
Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told The Wall Street Journal last month that Berkshire might close a few small businesses.
Investors have been disappointed with Berkshire. Its stock price has fallen 19% in 2020, compared with a 12% drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500, despite Buffett’s prediction that Berkshire would outperform in down markets.
The decline came after Berkshire’s stock lagged the index by more than 20 percentage points in 2019, including dividends.
In the first quarter, many Berkshire stock investments fared worse than the S&P, including American Express, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and the four airlines.
Falling stocks also caused a $1.39 billion pre-tax loss on derivatives contracts, where Berkshire is betting stock prices will rise over the long haul.

Berkshire was not a large net buyer of equities in the quarter, purchasing $4 billion and selling $2.2 billion.

Still, Shanahan said Berkshire is "as well positioned as it can be," reflecting its diverse businesses and substantial liquidity and access to capital. He rates Berkshire "buy."
Berkshire released results before its annual meeting, where Buffett said Berkshire in April sold its "entire positions" in the four largest U.S. airlines: American, Delta, Southwest and United.
Buffett said Berkshire "made a mistake" investing approximately $7 billion to $8 billion in the sector, which was changed "in a very major way" as the pandemic shut down most air travel, through no fault of the airlines.
The meeting was streamed on Yahoo Finance. It was held without the usual "Woodstock for Capitalists," a weekend of festivities that normally draws tens of thousands of people to Omaha, and which Buffett canceled because of the pandemic.
BERKSHIRE STOCK UNDERPERFORMS
Berkshire's first-quarter net loss was $49.75 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, reflecting $54.52 billion of losses on stock and other investments. Net earnings were $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per share, a year earlier.
An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized stock losses and gains with net results, causing huge swings that Buffett considers meaningless.
Quarterly operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 6% to $5.87 billion, or about $3,624 per Class A share, from $5.56 billion, or about $3,388 per share.
But year-earlier results reflected a charge for investments linked to what prosecutors called a Ponzi scheme at a solar company, which Berkshire did not know about.
Operating profit at Berkshire's businesses fell 3%, with declines at BNSF, utilities and energy units, and manufacturing, service and retailing operations such as Precision Castparts, which Berkshire bought for $32.1 billion in 2016.
Geico was able to post a 28% gain in pre-tax underwriting profit because people drove less, resulting in fewer claims for crashes. Still, the insurer, like others, is offering relief on premiums to policyholders.
Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told The Wall Street Journal last month that Berkshire might close a few small businesses.
Investors have been disappointed with Berkshire. Its stock price has fallen 19% in 2020, compared with a 12% drop in the Standard & Poor's 500, despite Buffett's prediction that Berkshire would outperform in down markets.
The decline came after Berkshire's stock lagged the index by more than 20 percentage points in 2019, including dividends.
In the first quarter, many Berkshire stock investments fared worse than the S&P, including American Express, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and the four airlines.
Falling stocks also caused a $1.39 billion pre-tax loss on derivatives contracts, where Berkshire is betting stock prices will rise over the long haul.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett's Berkshire posts nearly $50 billion loss as coronavirus causes pain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc is being hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, posting a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50 billion on Saturday and saying performance is suffering in several major operating businesses.
Berkshire said most of its more than 90 businesses are facing "relatively minor to severe" negative effects from COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus and now punishing the global economy, with revenue slowing considerably in April even at businesses deemed "essential."
The BNSF railroad saw shipping volumes of consumer products and coal fall, while Geico set aside money for car insurance premiums it no longer expects to collect. Some businesses cut salaries and furloughed workers, and retailers such as See's Candies and the Nebraska Furniture Mart closed stores.
Buffett also allowed Berkshire's cash stake to rise to a record $137.3 billion from $128 billion at the end of 2019.
That reflected the 89-year-old billionaire's inability to make large, "elephant" size acquisitions for his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, and caution in buying stocks.
Berkshire said it bought only a net $1.8 billion of stocks in the first quarter. It also said it repurchased $1.7 billion of its own stock, but that was less than in the prior quarter.
"Historically, Buffett has been so visible in times of crisis, and encouraged investors to take advantage of market selloffs, but if he doesn't see opportunities even in his own stock, what are we to think?" said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co in St. Louis.

Buffett said Berkshire "made a mistake" investing approximately $7 billion to $8 billion in the sector, which was changed "in a very major way" as the pandemic shut down most air travel, through no fault of the airlines.
The meeting was streamed on Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance. It was held without the usual "Woodstock for Capitalists," a weekend of festivities that normally draws tens of thousands of people to Omaha, and which Buffett canceled because of the pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Flight Centre Just Axed Cancellation Fees & Will Issue Refunds After Pressure From The ACCC</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Flight Centre has scrapped cancellation fees due the coronavirus pandemic and will refund everyone who was charged from March 13, after countless Aussies complained to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
Until now, the travel agent had been stinging customers with a $300 fee per person for cancelled international flights, and a $50 fee per person for cancelled domestic flights. It didn’t matter whether or not the cancellation was the choice of the customer or if the flight had been cancelled by the airline due to the pandemic.
“This is a very welcome move made by Flight Centre for thousands of customers impacted by COVID-19 travel cancellations,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.
“We are continuing to discuss issues in relation to refunds and cancellations with the travel sector, and encourage travel providers to treat consumers fairly in these exceptional circumstances.
“While we know some consumers are very concerned about getting a refund or credit for their cancelled travel plans, we do ask people to be mindful of the significant impact that this pandemic has had on the travel industry.”
The policy will also apply to other travel agents which are part of the Flight Centre Group: Aunt Betty, Travel Associates, Student Universe, Universal Traveller and BYOjet.
Flight Centre executive general manager Allisa O’Connell told customers about the new policy in an email on Saturday night.
“The decision to waive fees will impact our business, nevertheless we have heard your feedback and we believe this step is the right one for the current economic conditions where stand-downs and job losses are a daily occurrence for many Australians,” she wrote.
“Please note this waiver applies to our fees – we cannot waive fees or conditions that airlines and other third-party suppliers impose.”
The ACCC said it’s received over 6,000 complaints about refunds in the travel industry, but didn’t say how many were about Flight Centre in particular.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Flight Centre bows to fee storm, avoids ACCC lawsuit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Flight Centre avoided a costly legal clash with the competition regulator after bowing to pressure over its cancellation fees.
Travel agencies including Brisbane-based Flight Centre have been criticised by customers over communication failures, fees, changes to refund policies and delays in refunding money as the coronavirus pandemic caused countries to close borders.
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims said on Sunday: "We are continuing to discuss issues in relation to refunds and cancellations with the travel sector, and encourage travel providers to treat consumers fairly in these exceptional circumstances.
"While we know some consumers are very concerned about getting a refund or credit for their cancelled travel plans, we do ask people to be mindful of the significant impact that this pandemic has had on the travel industry."
One gripe with Flight Centre had been over a $300 cancellation fee. The company had already altered its policies once to try to soothe anger, saying last week that customers who retained credit with the travel agency could book a holiday until December next year then seek a refund without incurring any fees.
If a cancellation fee was to be charged for someone seeking a refund earlier, it would be capped at two customers per group, or $600 in total for international travel.
That move had left Mr Sims "not content" last week. At the weekend, amid a barrage of complaints on social media including Facebook, Flight Centre changed its policy again.
The travel agency said it would "waive its usual cancellation fees for bookings where the travel provider [eg airline, cruise line or tour operator] has cancelled its service and you are unable to travel as a result".
"The decision to waive fees will impact our business, nevertheless we have heard your feedback."
The ACCC, which in the past decade took Flight Centre to the High Court over allegations of price-fixing that resulted in a $12.5 million fine, welcomed the travel agent’s latest move.
"[The ACCC’s] next step would have been court action if Flight Centre did not change its position. This announcement will provide faster relief for consumers than would have been likely to have resulted from any court action," the regulator said.
Guidance from the ACCC has been that people should be compensated by methods including a refund or voucher. But Mr Sims had said one of the key questions about cancellation fees was whether it related to the customer cancelling or cancellations having to be made in the pandemic.
A Flight Centre spokesman said the company had believed it had been acting lawfully and within guidelines with its initial approach, but understood that some customers had not been happy.
People who kept credit with Flight Centre instead of seeking a refund would receive extra vouchers. The travel agency also tried to reassure customers about its longevity by pointing to it recently raising $700 million.
Other travel outfits have also faced ACCC pressure or customer complaints. Webjet and STA Travel have been criticised for failing to contact customers.
Customers accused STA of changing refund policies, with some saying the changes meant they could only get credit. But a company spokeswoman denied "any changes to the terms and conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19, contrary to many other travel companies".
After discussions with the ACCC, travel outfit Intrepid agreed to honour refund policies that had been active when customers had earlier booked journeys before it changed terms and conditions and offered credit instead.
On Friday, travel agency Helloworld said: "many suppliers, including airlines, cruise operators, tour operators and other providers have unilaterally changed their cancellation conditions and are offering future travel credits rather than cash refunds".
"Many customers are agreeable to accepting credits for future travel, particularly on the basis that any applicable cancellation fees are fully waived, however, we are working with suppliers on behalf of our customers who are seeking a cash refund where such a refund was a term of the original booking," it said.
Helloworld also said it was not currently seeking to raise funds. Having cut costs, it would likely chew through between $1.5 million and $2 million a month for the next six months. It was also owed $3.7 million by Virgin Australia.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Flight Centre scraps cancellation fees for trips affected by virus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Flight Centre has decided to stop charging customers for cancelling trips due to the coronavirus pandemic.
It comes following mounting pressure from the consumer watchdog, who received a large number of complaints from Australians about the cancellation fees.
The ACCC today welcomed the announcement by the travel agent, revealing their next step was to take court action if Flight Centre refused to change its position.
“This is a very welcome move made by Flight Centre for thousands of customers impacted by COVID-19 travel cancellations,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.
“We are continuing to discuss issues in relation to refunds and cancellations with the travel sector, and encourage travel providers to treat consumers fairly in these exceptional circumstances.
“While we know some consumers are very concerned about getting a refund or credit for their cancelled travel plans, we do ask people to be mindful of the significant impact that this pandemic has had on the travel industry.”
Flight Centre will now refund thousands of customers who, from 13 March, were charged $300 per person to get a refund for a cancelled international flight or $50 for a domestic flight.
This policy will also apply to cancellations fees charged by Aunt Betty, Travel Associates, Student Universe, Universal Traveller and Jetescape Travel, which are part of the Flight Centre group.

“It’s been seven weeks since I’ve had a haircut,” the billionaire investor and Berkshire CEO said during the virtual event, which was livestreamed by Yahoo Finance.
“It’s been more than seven weeks since I put on a tie or anything,” Buffett continued. “Just a question of which sweatsuit I wear.”

The 89-year-old has likely been avoiding a trip to the barbers and other non-essential social contact to avoid catching the potentially lethal virus.
He joked in March that he was “drinking a little more Coca-Cola” during the pandemic, as the soda “seems to have warded off everything else in life.”
Buffett made his latest comments while discussing Berkshire’s exit from its positions in the “big four” US airlines. The conglomerate sold $US6.1 billion in stock on a net basis in April, which Buffett attributed to dumping airline stocks.
He suggested that people might fly less in the coming years out of fear of catching the virus, or cut back on travel after realising the ease of working from home. Fewer passengers could force the airlines to drop prices, widening their losses due to the coronavirus.

Buffett made his latest comments while discussing Berkshire’s exit from its positions in the “big four” US airlines. The conglomerate sold $6.1 billion in stock on a net basis in April, which Buffett attributed to dumping airline stocks.
He suggested that people might fly less in the coming years out of fear of catching the virus, or cut back on travel after realizing the ease of working from home. Fewer passengers could force the airlines to drop prices, widening their losses due to the coronavirus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Monty Bennett, Trump donor and largest recipient of PPP funds, will return money</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The hotel conglomerate run by a major campaign donor to President Donald Trump, Monty Bennett, announced Saturday it would return all the money it received through the Paycheck Protection Program.
"The Ashford Group of Companies announced today that all of its companies, including Ashford Inc. (NYSE American: AINC), Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. (NYSE: AHT) ("Ashford Trust"), and Braemar Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE: BHR) ("Braemar"), will return all funds provided by the Small Business Administration's ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") due to the agency's recently changed rules and inconsistent federal guidance that put the companies at compliance risk," Bennett's companies said in a statement emailed to investors.
Bennett's decision came two hours after Democratic nominee Joe Biden blasted Bennett, tweeting, "Monty Bennett should return the tens of millions of dollars he received, and we should give it to the small businesses that need it."
Bennett runs a conglomerate of 128 hotels, which received, collectively, more than $58 million through the PPP. Business Insider broke the news on April 23 that he won the money after contributing significantly to Trump's re-election and spent $50,000 to hire two of the president's fundraisers to lobby the administration for bailout money.
A Bennett company spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment Saturday night. Two days ago, the Bennett spokesman said the company was still deciding whether to return the money. Spokespeople for the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration did not immediately return requests for comment Saturday.
One week ago, Bennett announced he did not plan to return the money unless pressed to by the SBA. The Treasury Department announced on April 23 that it would require publicly traded companies, like Bennett's to return the PPP money, following a massive public backlash as it was revealed some of the biggest recipients were large chains like Shake Shack and Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. 
The fund, originally designed to help small businesses weather the COVID-19 pandemic, was quickly drained of the first infusion of $349 billion from Congress. Congress held an emergency series of meetings through April to approve another $300 billion for the program.  
Bennett pleaded his case through March as the COVID-19 outbreak racked his hotel conglomerate, which includes high-end properties like Ritz-Carltons, and more modest fare like Courtyard Suites, spread across the nation. He took to the airwaves to say he may not be able to make the coming debt payments on $4 billion of outstanding loans and had been forced to lay off 90% of the staff in his hotels.
But it wasn't until after he hired two prominent fundraisers for the Trump campaign, Jeff Miller and Roy Bailey, to lobby the Treasury Department, that loans started coming through for him. 
Bennett noted in a statement Saturday night that he was invited to the White House with other hotel owners on March 17 — one week after he hired Miller and Bailey to lobby for him. 
"The hotel industry has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting National Emergency," Bennet said in a statement. "Hotel industry executives met with the Administration at the White House on March 17, 2020 to plead for help for our industry. We are disappointed that, in an abundance of caution to avoid any risk of non-compliance with the changed PPP rules, our actions mean that our employees, vendors, communities and others in need will not benefit from the PPP as Congress intended.  We call on Congress, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to provide assistance to the hotel industry to protect jobs and asset values that have been severely impaired as a result of the pandemic and the government's actions that have followed."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ashford Group Of Companies Takes Action To Meet Changed Paycheck Protection Program Eligibility Guidelines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DALLAS, May 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The Ashford Group of Companies announced today that all of its companies, including Ashford Inc. (NYSE American: AINC), Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. (NYSE: AHT) ("Ashford Trust"), and Braemar Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE: BHR) ("Braemar"), will return all funds provided by the Small Business Administration's ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") due to the agency's recently changed rules and inconsistent federal guidance that put the companies at compliance risk.
Federal Government assistance is required to repair the most significant damage in history to U.S. hotels and hospitality businesses caused by government-ordered shutdowns and restrictions on travel and public gatherings. Industry-wide revenue is down approximately 80-90% as a result of the government orders, resulting in the immediate loss of 3.9 million jobs, according to the American Hotel & Lodging Association.
Some media and members of Congress have falsely implied that Ashford accessed "loopholes" in the CARES Act to qualify for the PPP funds. In fact, Congress designed the PPP to specifically allow companies that own multiple hotel properties to obtain separate loans for each property as a means to prevent the economic collapse of the hospitality industry that is now occurring. This is why Congress wrote the CARES Act to waive the SBA's standard affiliation rules for hotels and restaurants, as follows:
[A]ny business concern that employs not more than 500 employees per physical location of the business concern and that is assigned a North American Industry Classification System code beginning with 72 at the time of disbursal shall be eligible to receive a covered loan.
This specific provision of the law was referenced in the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program Frequently Asked Questions ("FAQ") published on April 13, 2020:
Question 24: How do the $10 million cap and affiliation rules work for hotels and restaurants (and any business assigned a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code beginning with 72)?
Answer: Under the CARES Act, any single business entity that is assigned a NAICS code beginning with 72 (including hotels and restaurants) and that employs not more than 500 employees per physical location is eligible to receive a PPP loan.
Ashford relied on the statute as passed by Congress and the guidance provided by the SBA to apply for PPP loans in good faith. Ashford also relied on the SBA's view that its affiliation rules do not apply to any business entity that is assigned a NAICS code beginning with 72 and that employs not more than a total of 500 employees. Under these rules, qualified hotels and restaurants that are owned by a parent business are permitted to apply for separate PPP loans, provided that each property maintains a unique EIN. The $10 million maximum loan amount under the PPP applies to every eligible business entity.
Ashford applied for PPP loans for each qualified hotel property in full compliance with this guidance, and in the belief it was our obligation to protect our employees, vendors, communities, lenders and shareholders from unfair economic damage.
Since we submitted our loan applications, the rules have changed almost daily. In fact, the SBA has issued numerous Interim Final Rules and at least 12 separate FAQs. For example, the SBA added the following new guidance relating to public companies on April 23, 2020 (weeks after we submitted our PPP applications):
31. Question: Do businesses owned by large companies with adequate sources of liquidity to support the business's ongoing operations qualify for a PPP loan?
Answer: In addition…borrowers should review carefully the required certification that "[c]urrent economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the Applicant." Borrowers must make this certification in good faith, taking into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support their ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. For example, it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith, and such a company should be prepared to demonstrate to SBA, upon request, the basis for its certification.
Ashford companies do not have "substantial market value" compared to the majority of other publicly-traded companies or even Ashford's own market values before the government shutdown actions. We also now have limited access to the capital markets across our companies.
More recently, the SBA issued a Fifth Interim Final Rule on April 30, 2020, with the following addition:
Can a single corporate group receive unlimited PPP loans?
No. To preserve the limited resources available to the PPP program, and in light of the previous lapse of PPP appropriations and the high demand for PPP loans, businesses that are part of a single corporate group shall in no event receive more than $20,000,000 of PPP loans in the aggregate. For purposes of this limit, businesses are part of a single corporate group if they are majority owned, directly or indirectly, by a common parent. This limitation shall be immediately effective with respect to any loan that has not yet been fully disbursed as of April 30, 2020. Businesses are subject to this limitation even if the businesses are eligible for the waiver of affiliation provision under the CARES Act or are otherwise not considered to be affiliates under SBA's affiliation rules.
While we believed then and continue to believe today that we qualify for PPP loans based on the legislation and rule-making in place at the time our applications were submitted, continuous SBA rule changes and evolving opinions by Administration officials have led us to conclude that we may no longer qualify. As a result, the Ashford Group of Companies will return all PPP funds on or before May 7, 2020, in accordance with SBA's previously announced safe harbor.
Ashford management had no intention of crowding out any business from gaining equal access to the PPP funds, and could not have known that congressional appropriations for the program would be insufficient to cover the needs of all other businesses in the nation that have suffered similar harm. Congress and the Administration should have known but chose to restrict funding when the CARES Act was passed on March 27, only to provide additional funding later. In fact, Congress did not make any changes to the rules under which Ashford had already applied for and received funds when it passed its second version of the CARES Act nearly a month later on April 23. In the face of continuing confusion, the need for immediate government action to fix the PPP program and repair economic damage is acute and growing.
"The hotel industry has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting National Emergency," commented Monty J. Bennett, Ashford Inc.'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Ashford Trust and Braemar. "Hotel industry executives met with the Administration at the White House on March 17, 2020 to plead for help for our industry. We are disappointed that, in an abundance of caution to avoid any risk of non-compliance with the changed PPP rules, our actions mean that our employees, vendors, communities and others in need will not benefit from the PPP as Congress intended. We call on Congress, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to provide assistance to the hotel industry to protect jobs and asset values that have been severely impaired as a result of the pandemic and the government's actions that have followed."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ashford Group Of Companies Takes Action To Meet Changed Paycheck Protection Program Eligibility Guidelines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DALLAS, May 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The Ashford Group of Companies announced today that all of its companies, including Ashford Inc. (NYSE American: AINC), Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. (NYSE: AHT) ("Ashford Trust"), and Braemar Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE: BHR) ("Braemar"), will return all funds provided by the Small Business Administration's ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") due to the agency's recently changed rules and inconsistent federal guidance that put the companies at compliance risk.
Federal Government assistance is required to repair the most significant damage in history to U.S. hotels and hospitality businesses caused by government-ordered shutdowns and restrictions on travel and public gatherings. Industry-wide revenue is down approximately 80-90% as a result of the government orders, resulting in the immediate loss of 3.9 million jobs, according to the American Hotel & Lodging Association.
Some media and members of Congress have falsely implied that Ashford accessed "loopholes" in the CARES Act to qualify for the PPP funds.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's economy in 2020 could shrink more than initially forecast due to extended curbs on movement imposed to stem an outbreak of the new coronavirus, the finance minister said on Saturday (May 2).
Malaysia's central bank had forecast in April for growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of between -2 per cent and 0.5 per cent this year.
"But that forecast was made after just two weeks of movement curbs. We're now more than five weeks in ... so our GDP could shrink even more," Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said in an interview with a local television channel.
Malaysia, which has announced a stimulus package worth 250 billion ringgit (US$5.8 billion) to help cushion the economic blow from the outbreak, will also announce an economic recovery plan later this month, the minister said.
Malaysian authorities on Saturday defended plans to ease coronavirus lockdown measures next week even as the number of new infections jumped to a two-week high.
Most businesses will reopen on Monday, although schools, cinemas and nightclubs will remain closed, along with the country's borders. Mass gatherings will still be banned.
Security minister Ismail Sabri said Malaysia was not being hasty in relaxing the curbs, stressing that businesses reopening will have to implement hygiene and social distancing measures.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bitcoin May be Topping Out After Buyers Lost a Key Level</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin has entered what appears to be another bout of sideways trading within the upper-$8,000 region. This has come about after the crypto’s bulls made another attempt to propel it past the resistance that has been established throughout the lower-to-mid $9,000 region.
The benchmark crypto’s recent price action has led analysts to note that it could be topping out, as the consecutive rejections it has posted throughout the past few days is a dire sign that greatly favors sellers.
If the crypto confirms this possibility and begins declining lower, its first major support zone exists around $8,250.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading up marginally at its current price of $8,935, marking a notable decline from daily highs of $9,200 that were set yesterday afternoon.
The crypto was able to post what appeared to be a sustained break above $9,000 yesterday afternoon, as buyers held BTC above this level for several hours before moving to test the resistance at $9,200.
The visit to this level, however, sparked a sharp selloff that led it down to its strong support at $8,800, which has since been defended.
One popular crypto trader spoke about this latest rejection in a recent tweet, explaining that it is now imperative that buyers continue defending the crypto’s point-of-control at $8,800.

Another popular pseudonymous trader recently explained that he believes BTC could be forming a local top as it fails to surmount its overhead resistance.

Because Bitcoin has broken below $9,000 in the time since this analysis was offered, it is a growing possibility that the crypto declines lower in the hours and days ahead.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Volume Trend Suggests Bitcoin is About to See Massive Volatility</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin’s recent uptrend appears to be far more than just a fleeting relief rally, as data suggests that it has been driven primarily by retail investors as margin traders flee the market due to the mass liquidations resulting from recent volatility.
This coincides with an interesting trend seen while looking towards the cryptocurrency’s daily volume, with the spike seen here potentially pointing to underlying strength behind the crypto’s recent price movement.
BTC’s 7-day volatility is also beginning to enter an uptrend following a prolonged period of decline– suggesting that the crypto could be poised to see further upside in the days and weeks ahead.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading up over 2.5% at its current price of $9,000. The benchmark cryptocurrency is currently in the process of surmounting this previously strong resistance region, and a sustained break above it could lead it to see some immense momentum.
It is important to keep in mind that the crypto did face a few strong rejections within the region over the past couple of days, with resistance being established at $9,200 and $9,500.
The lack of an intense downtrend following these rejections is likely the result of this movement being driven primarily by spot purchases rather than by margin traders – a trend that is elucidated while looking towards the massive decline in open interest seen throughout the past few days.
It also appears that retail investors are beginning to grow more active as margin traders flee the market, as Bitcoin’s trading volume has rocketed higher as of late, as seen by data from Arcane Research.
Another interesting trend that Arcane points to in their report is that Bitcoin’s volatility appears to be starting to return to normal following a multi-week phase of declining.
Because the market is currently being controlled by spot traders, this increase in volatility could primarily favor buyers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bitcoin Falls Back Into The Upper-$8,000 Region</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin has entered what has all the earmarks of being another episode of sideways trading inside the upper-$8,000 area. This has come to to fruition after the cryptocurrency’s bulls made another attempt endeavor to drive it past the resistance that has been built up all through the lower-to-mid $9,000 region.
The benchmark cryptocurrency’s recent value activity has driven experts to take note of that it could be topping out, as the consecutive dismissals it has posted all through the previous few days is a desperate sign that extraordinarily favors sellers.
In case the cryptocurrency confirms this chance and starts declining lower, its first significant support zone exists around $8,250.
At the hour of writing this post, Bitcoin is trading up hardly at its present price of $8,846, denoting an notable decay from daily highs of $9,200 that were set yesterday evening.
The cryptocurrency had the option to present what showed up on be a continued break above $9,000 yesterday evening, as purchasers held Bitcoin (BTC) over this level for a few hours before moving to test the resistance at $9,200.
The visit to this level, nonetheless, started a sharp selloff that drove it down to its solid support at $8,800, which has since been guarded.
One well-known cryptocurrency trader talked about this most recent dismissal in a recent tweet, clarifying that it is presently imperative that buyers keep shielding the cryptocurrency’s point-of-control at $8,800.
He said –
Another mainstream pseudonymous trader recently clarified that he trusts that Bitcoin could be shaping a local top as it neglects to conquer its overhead resistance.
He said –
Since Bitcoin has broken underneath $9,000 in the time since this analysis was offered, it is developing chance that the cryptocurrency decreases lower in the hours and days ahead.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi to take 'strict, painful' measures to deal with coronavirus impact</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">RIYADH — Saudi Arabia will take strict and painful measures to deal with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the finance minister said on Saturday, adding that “all options for dealing with the crisis are open.”
“We must reduce budget expenditures sharply,” Mohammed al-Jadaan said in an interview with Al Arabiya TV, adding that the impact of the new coronavirus on Saudi Arabia’s state finances will appear from the second quarter of the year.
“Saudi finances need more discipline and the road ahead is long,” he said.
One measure would be to slow down government projects, including mega-projects, to reduce spending, he said.
The world’s largest oil exporter is suffering from historically low oil prices, while measures to fight the coronavirus are likely to curb the pace and scale of economic reforms launched by Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman.
Saudi Arabia’s central bank foreign exchange reserves fell in March at their fastest rate in at least 20 years, hitting their lowest level since 2011, while the kingdom slipped to a $9 billion budget deficit in the first quarter as oil revenue collapsed.
Jadaan said last month that Riyadh could borrow $26 billion more this year while it would draw down up to $32 billion from its foreign reserves to finance the deficit.
On Saturday Jadaan told Al Arabiya Saudi Arabia had used some revenue from investments to plug the deficit, and that the crisis presented investment opportunities.
Jadaan noted the country had introduced stimulus measures aimed at preserving jobs in the private sector and safeguarding the provision of basic services.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi Arabian Finance Minister Says Real Impact of COVID-19 Expected in Second Quarter of 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIRUT (Sputnik) - The full impact of the coronavirus pandemic will reveal itself in the second quarter of this year, Saudi Arabia’s Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan said in an interview with local media.
According to Al-Jadaan, Saudi Arabia is considering a wide range of "strict and painful measures" to cut spending.
Al-Jadaan said that Saudi Arabia, as well as the world as a whole, will not return to what it was like before the coronavirus pandemic and suggested that economic processes will undergo significant changes.
In April, Saudi Arabian Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan said that his country was dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting significant drop in oil revenues from a position of strength, since serious reforms had been carried out in the country in recent years, while also indicating that Saudi Arabia had enough of a buffer to deal with the low prices.
As of 2 May, 3,272,202 people have contracted the novel coronavirus, with over 230,000 fatalities registered, the World Health Organization count shows. According to data from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Centre, more than 3.4 million COVID-19 cases have been confirmed globally since the start of the pandemic in December of last year. The global death toll from the viral disease stands at over 242,000.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi Arabia announces 8 coronavirus deaths</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JEDDAH: The economic challenges of the coronavirus pandemic are great and neither Saudi Arabia nor the world will be the same when it is over, the Kingdom’s Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan said on Saturday.
Saudi Arabia would take strict and painful measures to deal with the impact, and “all options for dealing with the crisis are open,” the minister said in an interview with Al-Arabiya TV.
“We must reduce budget expenditures sharply,” Al-Jadaan said, and some government projects may be slowed down to reduce expenditure.
Al-Jadaan said that citizens’ welfare and their benefit is top priority, but that some of the action taken will be “painful, but for everyone’s benefit.”
“Current actions taken to date to cut spending are not enough, and Saudi public finances will need more control and the journey ahead is long.
This section contains relevant reference points, placed in (Opinion field)
“Expenses must be reduced to cope with the fallout from coronavirus and we need to be careful not to increase the cost of debt.”
“We are currently reviewing a set of initiatives to support the economy, the private sector and the health sector. Revenues have declined dramatically and are expected to continue to decline over this year and possibly until the beginning of the next fiscal year. Therefore we must be prepared, economically and financially, to confront this pandemic.
“We have to plan for the worst, take matters seriously and shrink … in order to continue providing citizens and expats with services, and manage the government.”
Al-Jadaan said that the Kingdom released economic support packages valuing SAR180 billion ($47.8 billion), but that it had used up SAR1 trillion from its reserves over the past four years.
“The real impact of the coronavirus pandemic will appear in the second quarter, and we have to face a very big revenue shock,” he said.
“We must tighten the belt and come out of the crisis strong.”
The number of virus cases in the Kingdom reached 25,459 on Saturday, an increase of 1,362, and the death toll rose by seven to 176. Worldwide, the virus has infected nearly 3.5 million people, and killed more than 240,000.

“It turned out I was wrong,” Buffett said about his decision to invest in the airlines. The companies are well managed and the CEOs “did a lot of things right,” he continued, but “the airline business … changed in a very major way.”
Berkshire’s first-quarter earnings revealed that it sold $6.1 billion in stock in April, without detailing what it sold. Buffett attributed that figure to Berkshire’s exit from the airlines.

Buffett explained the move by highlighting the airlines’ bailout deals with the US government. Their agreements include billions of dollars in loans that they will have to repay, as well as warrants that the Treasury can exercise to acquire their shares at a discount in the future. The warrant part of the deal was inspired by Buffett’s bailouts of Goldman Sachs and other companies during the financial crisis.
The investor also questioned whether people will fly as much in the next two or three years as they did last year. Even if passenger volumes bounce back to 70% or 80% of their pre-coronavirus levels, he said, the carriers will be left with “too many planes.”
“The future is much less clear to me,” Buffett said about the airline business.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Make giants share revenue</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Publishers that represent a majority of Canadian newspapers have penned an open letter to the federal government urging immediate action to make digital giants like Facebook and Google share their advertising revenues with Canadian media companies.
The letter, which appeared in an ad published in newspapers across the country Saturday, says the situation is urgent, with media companies suffering huge declines in advertising revenue because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The publishers point to action taken recently in Australia, where the country's treasurer has announced mandatory measures to force digital companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter to pay news media for use of their content.
The measures were to be completed by November, but are now being fast-tracked due to steep declines in advertising dollars caused by COVID-19 — declines that have forced many newspapers to stop printing.
Bob Cox, publisher of the Winnipeg Free Press and one of the signatories of the letter, says newspaper ad revenues in Canada have fallen by at least 50 per cent, which has made the newspaper industry unviable.
"Newspapers are fighting for their very survival right now," he said.
The wage subsidy that forms part of the Liberals' multi-billion dollar pandemic emergency aid package will help, Cox said, calling the program a "life-saver."
The Liberal government is also rolling out a $30-million COVID-19 awareness advertising campaign, which was also billed as support for the media industry, but Cox noted these measures are short-term fixes.
"We expect that the impact of COVID-19 and the decrease in advertising will continue for some time, at least through 2020 and probably into 2021, so we're going to be facing this decrease in advertising for a long time," he said.
"We need to look at the bigger picture, at the longer-term problems, and this is one of those longer-term problems."
Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said last month the government is moving closer to implementing long-promised tax credits for newspapers to address ongoing revenue challenges in the sector. The most significant of these measures is a tax credit that will allow qualified newspapers to claim up to 25 per cent of the wages or salaries they pay to their journalists or other eligible employees.
The credit, which is not available to broadcasters, will be retroactive to salaries that were paid starting on Jan. 1, 2019.
A panel tasked with assessing whether media organizations qualify for these tax measures will begin informing the first news organizations of their qualification for this program this spring, with payments coming in the summer, said Guilbeault's press secretary Camille Gagne-Raynauld.
"Additionally, we are accelerating the processing of applications to our Aid to Publishers program, and expect funds to flow to successful recipients in June," she added, referencing a program aimed at helping print magazines and non-daily newspapers.
As for the actions taken by Australia and France to set deadlines of July for digital giants to start paying for copyrighted media content, Gagne-Raynauld said the federal government is "closely following what is being done abroad with regards to media support," but did not elaborate further.

Cox says he understands the federal government has been busy rolling out billions of dollars in aid for Canadian workers and employers hit by the pandemic while also dealing with a public health emergency.
But implementing measures to make digital giants share the ad revenue they make from content created by Canadian journalists, which they have been featuring on their platforms, would level the playing field for the media industry in Canada, Cox said.
It would also go a long way to help the media industry weather the long-term impacts the pandemic and resulting economic downturn is having and will continue to have on news companies.
"Newspapers and news media in general have been very, very valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic, they have informed the public, they've fulfilled their role, the public has trusted them to deliver information about this very important issue to them," Cox said.
"We feel it's time to establish a solider business model for them going forward. We want to be around for the next time we're needed."
Facebook, Google and Twitter did not immediately respond for comment.
Facebook announced in March it was spending US$100 million to support the news industry during the COVID-19 crisis, and Google also has a Google News Initiative, with an aim to "work with the news industry to help journalism thrive in the digital age."
Torstar holds an investment in The Canadian Press as part of a joint agreement with subsidiaries of the Globe and Mail and Montreal's La Presse.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Publishers want Facebook, Google to share ad revenues amid COVID-19 declines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA - Publishers that represent a majority of Canadian newspapers have penned an open letter to the federal government urging immediate action to make digital giants like Facebook and Google share their advertising revenues with Canadian media companies.
The letter, which appeared in an ad published in newspapers across the country Saturday, says the situation is urgent, with media companies suffering huge declines in advertising revenue because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The publishers point to action taken recently in Australia, where the country's treasurer has announced mandatory measures to force digital companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter to pay news media for use of their content.
The measures were to be completed by November, but are now being fast-tracked due to steep declines in advertising dollars caused by COVID-19 — declines that have forced many newspapers to stop printing.
Bob Cox, publisher of the Winnipeg Free Press and one of the signatories of the letter, says newspaper ad revenues in Canada have fallen by at least 50 per cent, which has made the newspaper industry unviable.
"Newspapers are fighting for their very survival right now," he said.
The wage subsidy that forms part of the Liberals' multi-billion dollar pandemic emergency aid package will help, Cox said, calling the program a "life-saver."
The Liberal government is also rolling out a $30-million COVID-19 awareness advertising campaign, which was also billed as support for the media industry, but Cox noted these measures are short-term fixes.
"We expect that the impact of COVID-19 and the decrease in advertising will continue for some time, at least through 2020 and probably into 2021, so we're going to be facing this decrease in advertising for a long time," he said.
"We need to look at the bigger picture, at the longer-term problems, and this is one of those longer-term problems."
Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said last month the government is moving closer to implementing long-promised tax credits for newspapers to address ongoing revenue challenges in the sector. The most significant of these measures is a tax credit that will allow qualified newspapers to claim up to 25 per cent of the wages or salaries they pay to their journalists or other eligible employees.
The credit, which is not available to broadcasters, will be retroactive to salaries that were paid starting on Jan. 1, 2019.
A panel tasked with assessing whether media organizations qualify for these tax measures will begin informing the first news organizations of their qualification for this program this spring, with payments coming in the summer, said Guilbeault's press secretary Camille Gagne-Raynauld.
"Additionally, we are accelerating the processing of applications to our Aid to Publishers program, and expect funds to flow to successful recipients in June," she added, referencing a program aimed at helping print magazines and non-daily newspapers.
As for the actions taken by Australia and France to set deadlines of July for digital giants to start paying for copyrighted media content, Gagne-Raynauld said the federal government is "closely following what is being done abroad with regards to media support," but did not elaborate further.
Cox says he understands the federal government has been busy rolling out billions of dollars in aid for Canadian workers and employers hit by the pandemic while also dealing with a public health emergency.
But implementing measures to make digital giants share the ad revenue they make from content created by Canadian journalists, which they have been featuring on their platforms, would level the playing field for the media industry in Canada, Cox said.
It would also go a long way to help the media industry weather the long-term impacts the pandemic and resulting economic downturn is having and will continue to have on news companies.
"Newspapers and news media in general have been very, very valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic, they have informed the public, they've fulfilled their role, the public has trusted them to deliver information about this very important issue to them," Cox said.
"We feel it's time to establish a solider business model for them going forward. We want to be around for the next time we're needed."
Facebook, Google and Twitter did not immediately respond for comment.

US electric carmaker Tesla Inc has applied for a licence to supply electricity in the United Kingdom, The Telegraph reported on Saturday.
The purpose of the licence from the energy regulator may be to introduce the company’s Autobidder platform, the report said, citing a company source. The application did not make clear why Tesla has applied for the licence, The Telegraph reported.
Autobidder is a platform for automated energy trading and is currently being operated at Tesla’s Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia.
Having built a significant battery business in recent years, the carmaker is now preparing to enter the British market with its technology, the paper said, citing industry sources.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.
In 2017, the carmaker built world’s largest lithium ion battery to help keep the lights on in South Australia.
Shares of Tesla fell 9% on Friday after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted that the electric carmaker’s high-flying stock was overly expensive. “Tesla stock price is too high,” Musk said on Twitter.

South Africa is seeking to create a new thriving national airline out of the ashes of its current state-owned carrier, which is technically insolvent and on the brink of being placed in liquidation by administrators.
South African Airways (SAA) has recorded no profit since 2011 and has survived through government bailouts.
An ideal replacement for South African Airways would have both public and private owners, maintain the country’s trade connections and make a profit, the department of public enterprises said in a statement on Friday.
The embattled national carrier has been involuntary business rescue since December last year.
The rescue practitioners late last month said the airline cannot survive beyond month-end, and the choices left are either a forced liquidation or a winding down process.
All its flights have been grounded since South Africa closed its borders and went into a five-week nationwide Covid-19 lockdown in March which has made the survival of SAA, which employs 5,200 employees, even more uncertain.
The airline’s troubles were further worsened last month when the government refused to pay yet another 10 billion rand (531 million dollars) in emergency aid to the company, claiming resources had been stretched by the coronavirus pandemic.
“Stakeholders (…) have agreed on a long-term vision and strategy” with a view to “the creation of a new dynamic airline,” public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan said.
The minister said it will not be the old SAA but the beginning of a new journey towards the constitution of a newly restructured company which will be the new standard of South Africa. The new carrier is set to compete in the post-COVID-19 world.
According to the statement, SAA employees will be transitioned and new leadership and equity partners will be sought.
The demise of SAA would mark an end of era for the 86-year old airline which had gone through years of financial troubles associated and high debt associated with poor management.

South African Airways (SAA) has recorded no profit since 2011 and has survived through government bailouts.
An ideal replacement for South African Airways would have both public and private owners, maintain the country’s trade connections and make a profit, the department of public enterprises said in a statement on Friday.
The embattled national carrier has been in voluntary business rescue since December last year.
The rescue practitioners late last month said the of airline cannot survive beyond month end, and the choices left are either a forced liquidation or a winding down process.
All its flights have been grounded since South Africa closed its borders and went into a five-week nationwide Covid-19 lockdown in March which has made the survival of SAA, which employs 5,200 employees, even more uncertain.
The airline’s troubles were further worsened last month when the government refused to pay yet another 10 billion rand (531 million dollars) in emergency aid to the company, claiming resources had been stretched by the coronavirus pandemic.
“Stakeholders (…) have agreed on a long-term vision and strategy” with a view to “the creation of a new dynamic airline,” public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan said.
The minister said it will not be the old SAA but the beginning of a new journey towards the constitution of a new restructured company which will be the new standard of South Africa. The new carrier is set to compete in the post Covid-19 world.
According to the statement, SAA employees will be transitioned and new leadership and equity partners will be sought.
The demise of SAA would mark an end of era for the 86-year old airline which had gone through years of financial troubles associated and high debt associated with poor management.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Hamba kahle, totsiens’ to SAA as govt promises new national airline</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JOHANNESBURG – Government said it will be starting up a new airline to replace South African Airways (SAA).
The department of public enterprises said the new airline will not be the old SAA, but a restructured airline that South Africans can be proud of.
The move comes as the SAA business rescue practitioners moved to axe the entire workforce of SAA because the airline is broke.
It’s an end of an era for SAA, which has been in the air for 86 years.
The airline has been depending on government bailouts until it was placed under administration last year because of financial problems.
Last month, the business rescue practitioners asked for more money from government but were denied this.
Leading to them saying they have no choice but to terminate all employees of SAA and sell off its assets to pay its debt.
But it seems government and the unions have reached an agreement for a new airline with a business rescue plan that has not yet been agreed on.
The department of public enterprises said SAA employees will be transitioned and new leadership and equity partners will be sought.
Government said this new airline is set to compete in a world post-COVID-19.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett stays on sidelines with cash rising to $137 billion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Katherine Chiglinsky
Warren Buffett has been waiting years for stocks to look more attractive. He apparently didn’t think the first-quarter plunge was that opportunity.
As the coronavirus slowdown started to grip the U.S., the famed investor’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. was building its massive cash pile to a record $137 billion by the end of March. The company said that figure climbed even higher as it dumped more than $6 billion of stocks in April, making Buffett a net seller of equities so far this year.
Buffett, who will host Berkshire’s annual meeting virtually later Saturday, has largely stayed in the shadows as the pandemic hammered the global economy and stock markets. That’s a contrast to the financial crisis in 2008, when his Omaha-based company dipped into its vast cash reserves to gain lucrative preferred shares and rescue businesses teetering on the edge of collapse. While Berkshire’s operating earnings climbed in the first quarter, Buffett warned of pain from the virus’s fallout.
“As efforts to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated in the second half of March and continued through April, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe,” the company said in a regulatory filing Saturday.
The sharp drop in stocks sparked a debate over whether the slide was overblown, with some financial leaders highlighting buying opportunities and others predicting more pain to come. Those looking to Buffett for bullish signs would be left wanting. Berkshire reduced its stock buybacks even as its shares saw their biggest quarterly decline in more than a decade, while the $6.1 billion of net equities sales in April far outstripped the $1.8 billion of net purchases in the year’s first three months.
“Historically, he’s been pretty visible in the marketplace, encouraging investors to take advantage of market downturns and being greedy when others are fearful,” Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. “But if Buffett himself isn’t seeing opportunities, even in his own stock, what are we to think about the recent market selloff? Is it not a buying opportunity for long-term investors?”
Throwing off CashBerkshire’s Class A shares have dropped about 19% this year through Friday’s close, worse than the 12% decline in the S&P 500 over the same time period.
Berkshire repurchased just $1.7 billion of its own stock, less than it did in the last three months of 2019. The company recently disclosed that it pared back stakes in Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. as airlines have been pummeled by travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders worldwide.
Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, has been on the hunt for higher-returning investments such as acquisitions or stock purchases for years, but has struggled amid what he called “sky-high” prices. That has prompted a range of questions about whether he can continue the market-beating run that turned Berkshire into one of the world’s most valuable companies.
“He’s really careful about taking on risks that he can’t really ascertain, and I think that’s what’s happening now,” said Paul Lountzis, who oversees investments including Berkshire shares as president of Lountzis Asset Management.
The conglomerate’s first-quarter net income plunged to a loss of $49.7 billion, driven by $55.5 billion in unrealized losses in the huge stock portfolio. Gains in the insurance unit’s investing portfolio helped push operating earnings up almost 6% to $5.87 billion.
Wild RideBerkshire started to see the Covid-19 pandemic affect units including its railroad, BNSF, which reported a 5.2% decrease in volume in the first quarter. Precision Castparts, which makes products for industrial and energy companies, reported lower sales across all of its major markets, partially because of the pandemic and Boeing Co.’s 737 Max issues. The company’s footwear and apparel businesses were also hit, reporting a 34% decline in earnings.
The company said its essential businesses that have remained open saw revenue slow “considerably” in April, while many of those that had to close are being “severely impacted.” Berkshire didn’t record any goodwill impairments in the quarter, but said it may have to write down the value of some of its businesses at its next review in the fourth quarter. Still, the company called its liquidity and capital “extremely strong.”
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
“Berkshire Hathaway should still produce solid earnings and remain a bastion of financial strength, but stark 1Q declines bode poorly for 2020 comparisons.”
-- Matthew Palazola, senior industry analyst, and Derek Han, associate analyst
Buffett will host the annual meeting starting at 3:45 p.m. in Omaha with key deputy Greg Abel by his side. Buffett’s longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, won’t be in attendance. Follow the TopLive blog here.
Here are other details from Berkshire’s earnings report:
• Berkshire’s businesses have implemented business-continuity plans to help weather the crisis and are “preparing for reduced cash flows from reduced revenues and economic activity as a result of Covid-19.”
• Some operations have had to furlough employees, reduce wages and salaries, or cut back on capital spending to help mitigate the losses, Berkshire said in the report. See’s Candies, which Buffett bought in 1972, announced in early April that it would furlough retail workers and said more recently that it was testing reopening a few stores.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Algeria rules out IMF borrowing to ease financial woes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has declared his country will not approach the IMF for loans, despite a financial crisis triggered by a collapse in global oil prices and coronavirus lockdowns.
"Accumulating debt harms national sovereignty," said Tebboune, in a meeting with Algerian media broadcast late Friday.
The North African nation is heavily dependent on oil production, which generates over 90 percent of the country's export receipts.
A collapse in hydrocarbon prices this year -- caused by plunging demand due to societal lockdowns designed to combat the spread of coronavirus, and exacerbated by a brief price war between key players Russia and Saudi Arabia -- is putting ever greater pressure on Algeria's external accounts.
Even before this year's crisis took hold, Algeria's foreign exchange reserves had fallen to $62 billion at the end of 2019, from $180 billion in 2014.
But the president said Algeria would prefer "to borrow from its own citizens, rather than the International Monetary Fund or World Bank."
Algeria fell into heavy debt with the IMF during the 1990s, an episode Tebboune referenced in his address.
He also expressed aversion to borrowing from foreign banks, saying that doing so prevented Algeria making its position clear on issues including the fate of the Palestinians and Western Sahara.
Morocco has controlled most of the Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, since the 1970s.
It fought a war with the Algeria-backed Polisario Front over the territory from 1975 to 1991, when a ceasefire deal was agreed.
Tebboune also said that certain "friendly" nations had offered loans, which had been declined for the time being.
He did not specify which countries had offered assistance.
The president ruled out relying on extra printing of domestic currency by the central bank, noting that this could cause an inflationary spiral.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Algeria Refuses to Borrow from IMF to Ease Financial Crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has declared his country will not approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for loans, despite a financial crisis triggered by a collapse in global oil prices and coronavirus lockdowns.

Algeria is heavily dependent on oil production, which generates over 90 percent of its export receipts.
A collapse in hydrocarbon prices this year – caused by plunging demand due to societal lockdowns designed to combat the spread of coronavirus, and exacerbated by a brief price war between key players Russia and Saudi Arabia – is putting even greater pressure on Algeria's external accounts.
Even before this year’s crisis took hold, Algeria’s foreign exchange reserves had fallen to $62 billion at the end of 2019, from $180 billion in 2014.
But Tebboune stressed he prefers “to borrow from Algerian citizens, rather than the IMF or the World Bank.”
He also expressed reluctance to borrowing from foreign banks, saying that doing so prevented Algeria from making its position clear on issues including the fate of the Palestinian cause and Western Sahara.
Tebboune also said that several “friendly” nations had offered loans, which had been declined for the time being. he did not name these countries.
He ruled out relying on extra printing of the local currency by the central bank, noting that this could cause inflation.
Tebboune also revealed plans to develop new natural resources, including uranium, gold and phosphate, with the help of foreign investors, after the end of the health crisis caused by the novel coronavirus.
“The novel coronavirus has frozen several plans and projects. But they will be launched after the health crisis is overcome,” he said.
A sharp fall in oil and gas revenue in recent years has deepened the country’s financial problems, widening the budget and trade deficits.
Algeria still relies heavily on energy earnings despite previous announcements that it would carry out reforms and develop the non-hydrocarbon sector.
The coronavirus outbreak has worsened the economic situation with energy earnings dropping further, forcing the government to cut spending and planned investment for 2020.
“We are determined to develop our agriculture and reduce significantly the value of purchases from abroad,” Tebboune stressed.
Elected in December 2019 after mass protests demanding political and economic reforms and the removal of the ruling elite, Tebboune has vowed to open up the economy and amend the constitution to give a greater role to parliament.
“A political change will take place and strong institutions will be created,” Tebboune said, referring to demands by the protest movement known as Hirak.
The government has decided to postpone loan payments for state and private firms financially hit by the coronavirus, and Tebboune said more measures would be taken to benefit companies and the self-employed.
“Losses of firms are being assessed. We are ready to provide financial support. Even self-employed people such as taxi drivers and hairdressers will be helped,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Painful steps ahead to fight economic downturn — Al Jadaan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Ismaeel Naar, Joanne Serrieh and Omar ElkatouriDUBAI — Saudi Arabia is committed to protecting itself from the economic fallout of the coronavirus through any necessary financial measures despite plunging oil revenues, Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan told Al Arabiya on Saturday.Earlier this week, the Kingdom reported that its budget had fallen into a $9 billion deficit after oil revenue plunged amid a global oversupply of crude due to the coronavirus pandemic.Despite oil being Saudi Arabia’s largest revenue, the Kingdom maintains significant reserves and has vast untapped borrowing potential.While Al-Jadaan acknowledged that the unprecedented global economic impact of the coronavirus would also hit the Kingdom, he said that it was committed to taking the necessary measure to mitigate the fallout — including reducing expenditure and regulating public finance more.“The Kingdom is committed to the task of sustaining public financing, and is committed to having enough financial strength to face this crisis even if it is prolonged. We have taken several steps both in relation to health, and in relation to financial measures in terms of reducing expenditure.“Right now, we are looking at what we can do to reduce the deficit level. Certainly, there has been a significant drop in revenues, and we will likely see its impact in the coming quarters,” Al-Jadaan said during an exclusive interview with Al Arabiya.'Studying several options'The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) said late on Tuesday foreign assets fell in March to $464 billion, the lowest in 19 years, as the Kingdom moves to combat the economic fallout of the virus.Al-Jadaan said that authorities in Saudi Arabia are currently studying several options aimed at mitigating the damage caused by the coronavirus. The minister added that the drop in both oil and non-oil revenues will be seen further in the coming quarters.“We began the year with oil prices higher than $60 per barrel, these days we’re seeing the numbers near $20. This huge drop leads to a more than 50 percent drop in oil revenues,” he said.Saudi Arabia has implemented various policies to control the spread of the virus, including implementing a lockdown on most of the Kingdom, imposing a curfew to limit public movement and shutting incoming international travel.While important, these measures have also had a negative impact on the non-oil economy, as businesses remain closed and people are told to stay at home.“With non-oil revenues, due to the precautionary measures, they will be dropping as there is a huge reduction in economic activity and as a result, the non-oil revenues will drop.“We must deal with this wisely and efficiently and with God’s will the Kingdom will be looking at several options to face a pandemic the world has never seen the likes of for more than 70 years, since nearly World War II. At a global level, this level of pandemic has never been seen before,” Al-Jadaan said.The minister said last week the Kingdom would limit the amount of money it would take from its reserves to a maximum of $32 billion. Instead, the Kingdom will take advantage of its mostly untapped ability to borrow, and issue $60 billion of debt.“We will continue to take loans, and we have seen a large demand on government debt securities, internally or externally. As per the plan we will take loans up to SR220 billion, as per the conditions in the market and the available liquidity,” he said.Al-Jadaan added that he does not believe the Kingdom, or the world, will return to pre-coronavirus economic conditions, mainly as a result of the pandemic’s impact on economic activities and supply chains globally.'Steps taken will be painful'Discussing Saudi Arabia’s economic challenges, Al-Jadaan said that the Kingdom’s economy still depends greatly on public spending and it will therefore continue to maintain public finance to support the economy in the near future. However, he added that his ministry believes more regulations are needed to sustain the measures.“Public finance needs to be regulated more. The government has worked over the last four to five years on big regulations to regulate public finance and lower the deficit, but we still have a long way to go.“We will reduce expenditure, if God wills, even if some of the steps taken will be painful, but they are for the benefit of everyone, for the benefit of the country and for the benefit of the citizens,” Al-Jadaan said.In order to maintain and sustain public financing, the minister said that the government plans on redirecting some public funds to support the health sector in the coming quarters.“The government must take different measures than it previously has. There must be a limit to spending, redirecting parts of it to providing health services for the nationals and residents, and facing the results of the major shock in returns, whether that’s the result of major limitations on people in terms of restricting movement and economic activities. Therefore, its repercussions on demand of raw materials including petrol and the major drop in prices,” he said.Projects delayedAl-Jadaan explained the Kingdom is currently considering delaying some projects as a result of the impact.“As a result of the precautionary measures, therefore, we will reduce spending on them. Projects, whether major ones or some programs for achieving the (Vision 2030), that are, in their nature, a result of the precautionary measures, require delaying its implementation, therefore reducing the spending,” Al-Jadaan said.The finance minister said the Kingdom is also considering other items to limit spending, provided they do not affect people’s basic services.“We’re also considering other items, as long as we don’t touch basic services for the people, all options are open. And, the government is currently studying the effect of these options and will therefore decide based on it and we will make recommendations soon,” he confirmed. — Al Arabiya English

Earlier this week he said Riyadh could borrow around $26 billion more this year and would draw down up to $32 billion from its reserves to finance the deficit.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Algeria rules out IMF borrowing to ease financial woes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has declared his country will not approach the IMF for loans, despite a financial crisis triggered by a collapse in global oil prices and coronavirus lockdowns.
“Accumulating debt harms national sovereignty,” said Tebboune, in a meeting with Algerian media broadcast late Friday.
The North African nation is heavily dependent on oil production, which generates over 90 percent of the country’s export receipts.
A collapse in hydrocarbon prices this year — caused by plunging demand due to societal lockdowns designed to combat the spread of coronavirus, and exacerbated by a brief price war between key players Russia and Saudi Arabia — is putting ever greater pressure on Algeria’s external accounts.
Even before this year’s crisis took hold, Algeria’s foreign exchange reserves had fallen to $62 billion at the end of 2019, from $180 billion in 2014.
But the president said Algeria would prefer “to borrow from its own citizens, rather than the International Monetary Fund or World Bank.”
Algeria fell into heavy debt with the IMF during the 1990s, an episode Tebboune referenced in his address.
He also expressed aversion to borrowing from foreign banks, saying that doing so prevented Algeria making its position clear on issues including the fate of the Palestinians and Western Sahara.
Morocco has controlled most of the Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, since the 1970s.
It fought a war with the Algeria-backed Polisario Front over the territory from 1975 to 1991, when a ceasefire deal was agreed.
Tebboune also said that certain “friendly” nations had offered loans, which had been declined for the time being.
He did not specify which countries had offered assistance.
The president ruled out relying on extra printing of domestic currency by the central bank, noting that this could cause an inflationary spiral.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett remains optimistic about future despite coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Billionaire investor Warren Buffett doesn't know how or when the economy will recover from the coronavirus outbreak shutdown, but he remains optimistic in the long-term future of the United States.
Buffett said Saturday at Berkshire Hathaway's online annual meeting that there's no way to predict the economic future right now because the possibilities are still too varied. Berkshire's meeting was held without any of the roughly 40,000 shareholders who typically attend because of the virus.
"We do not know exactly what happens when you voluntarily shut down a substantial portion of your society," Buffett said because it has never been done. He said it may take several years to understand all the economic implications of the coronavirus outbreak, but it hasn't changed his long-term view because the country has endured wars and depressions before.
“In the end, the answer is never bet against America,” Buffett said.
It's not clear how long the virus will continue to weigh on the economy, Buffett said. He said there could still be unpleasant surprises from the virus and the way people react to it.
“You're dealing with a huge unknown,” Buffett said, so businesses and investors can't be certain of what will happen in the near future.
Buffett said he doesn't expect major banks to have significant financial problems during the virus crisis because they are in much better shape than they were during the financial crisis of 2008.
All of the events surrounding the annual meeting, including a trade show where Berkshire companies sell their products, were cancelled this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, and Buffett had a different partner for the question session.
Instead of sitting next to business partner Charlie Munger in an arena filled with shareholders, Buffett was joined this year by Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel, who oversees all of the company's non-insurance businesses, to answer questions in front of a Yahoo Finance camera.
“It's certainly a break with years and years of tradition with Buffett and Munger,” said Andy Kilpatrick, a retired stockbroker who wrote a Buffett biography and has attended every annual meeting since 1985.
The fact that Abel appeared alongside Buffett will add to speculation that he could one day succeed the 89-year-old billionaire as CEO, but it likely also reflects the fact that Abel is based relatively close to Omaha, in Des Moines, Iowa. Abel and fellow longtime executive Ajit Jain, who oversees Berkshire's insurance businesses, are seen as the two most likely successor candidates although Buffett has no plans to retire.
Omaha missed out on the profits that comes from all the out-of-town visitors attending the meeting. Local economic development officials estimate that Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting normally provides a $21.3 million boost to the area.
Buffett and Abel discussed the nearly $50 billion loss that Berkshire reported Saturday morning and the huge pile of cash the company is holding.
Berkshire said it lost $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, during the first quarter. That's down from last year's profit of $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per Class A share.
The biggest factor in the loss was a $54.5 billion loss on the value of Berkshire's investment portfolio as the stock market declined sharply after the coronavirus outbreak began.
Berkshire’s revenue grew 1 percent to $61.27 billion. The company said revenue slowed considerably in April as the virus outbreak negatively affected most of its businesses. Berkshire closed several of its retail businesses, such as See’s Candy and the Nebraska Furniture Mart, this spring while BNSF railroad and its insurance and utility businesses continued operating while adjusting to reduced demand.
Berkshire is sitting on a pile of more than $137 billion cash because Buffett has struggled to find major acquisitions for the company recently and he wants to be prepared to endure any crisis. Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said it was striking that Buffett didn't find any bargains to invest in at the end of the first quarter.
“The lack of investment activity really sticks out,” Shanahan said.
Buffett said that Berkshire sold roughly $6.5 billion of stock in April when it unloaded his company's roughly 10% stakes in the four largest airlines. Buffett said he decided that he made a mistake in how he valued airlines, so he sold all of Berkshire's American, Delta, Southwest and United Continental airline stock.
Buffett said he hasn't made any big deals during the coronavirus crisis because he hasn't seen any on attractive terms. He said many companies have been able to borrow money in the market in the past two months because the Federal Reserve stepped in to keep markets moving, so they haven't turned to Berkshire for help.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns more than 90 companies, including the railroad and insurance, utility, furniture and jewelry businesses. The company also has major investments in such companies as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Bank of America.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OMAHA, Neb. >> Billionaire investor Warren Buffett doesn’t know how or when the economy will recover from the coronavirus outbreak shutdown, but he remains optimistic in the long-term future of the United States.

He said it may take several years to understand all the economic implications of the coronavirus outbreak, but it hasn’t changed his long-term view because the country has endured wars and depressions before.
“I remain convinced … that nothing can basically stop America,” Buffett said.
It’s not clear how long the virus will continue to weigh on the economy, Buffett said.
“You’re dealing with a huge unknown,” Buffett said, so businesses can’t be certain of what will happen in the next several months.
Buffett said he doesn’t expect major banks to have significant financial problems during the virus crisis because they are in much better shape than they were during the financial crisis of 2008.
He said there could still be unpleasant surprises from the virus and the way people react to it. Buffett said government programs to help people and businesses who are struggling during the virus outbreak make sense.
“I think it’s a very good idea to take care of people who are having trouble taking care of themselves during this period,” he said.
All of the events surrounding the annual meeting, including a trade show where Berkshire companies sell their products, were cancelled this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, and Buffett had a different partner for the question session.

The biggest factor in the loss was a $54.5 billion loss on the value of Berkshire’s investment portfolio as the stock market declined sharply after the coronavirus outbreak began. The year before, Berkshire’s investments added $15.5 billion to the company’s profits.
Buffett has long said Berkshire’s operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. By that measure, Berkshire’s operating earnings improved to $5.87 billion, or $3,617.62 per Class A share, from $5.56 billion, or $3,387.56 per Class A share.
Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected operating earnings per Class A share of $3,796.90 on average.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Indian industry need to undertake technological upgradation and import substitution to attract investments from global businesses that look to exit China due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Saturday. 
The minister has been exhorting the industry to capitalise on growing "hatred" against China amid coronavirus pandemic.

Interacting with members of the Ficci Ladies Organization in a webinar, the minister for MSME and Road Transport and Highways said recommendations for "another big package" have been shared with the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister, and said he was "hopeful of a declaration soon".
Gadkari also expressed confidence that 25 lakh MSMEs will be restructured by the end of the year. 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) extended the restructuring of debt schemes beyond the deadline of March 31, 2020, to December 31, 2020. 
Observing that big industries from nations including Japan, the US, Germany and other European nations do not want to deal with China anymore and want to shift their businesses out of the country, the minister termed it a "golden opportunity" for Indian industry and entrepreneurs.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Referring to the economic crisis across the world, Gadkari said that it is a golden opportunity for Indian industries and entrepreneurs to explore new businesses and attract investments from global businesses that look to exit China
The central government is likely to announce a relief package for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) that have been affected due to the coronavirus lockdown, Union MSME Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Saturday. He said that the financial package is expected to be announced in due course.
"We have sent recommendations for a relief package to the Finance Minister and Prime Minister, and I hope it will be announced soon," Gadkari said while addressing a webinar in New Delhi today.
He urged Indian industries to have a positive attitude and asked them to adopt an integrated approach to overcome the crisis while ensuring the lives and livelihood of people.
Referring to the economic crisis across the world, Gadkari said that it is a golden opportunity for Indian industries and entrepreneurs to explore new businesses. He suggested that Indian Inc must  adopt technological innovation and import substitution to attract investments from global businesses that look to exit China.
Interacting with members of the FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO) in a webinar, the minister expressed confidence that 25 lakh MSMEs will be restructured by the end of the year.

Last week, during an interaction with the representatives of Associated Chambers of Commerce of India (ASSOCHAM) on impact of COVID-19 on MSMEs, Gadkari had said that the government was working on a dedicated fund to address delayed payments of MSMEs.
"We have prepared a fund of Rs 1 lakh crore and government will pay for the insurance. We will fix a formula on how to coordinate between all 3 stakeholders - the one who has to receive money, the one who has to pay money, and bank," Gadkari had said. The fund will provide some relief to the MSME sector to tide over the negative impact of novel coronavirus-related disruption in their businesses and revenue losses. The corpus will be a mobile fund that will help increase liquidity in the market, he said.

MSMEs contribute to 29 per cent of GDP in the country and employ over 11 crore people.
On April 17, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did try to ease the liquidity crisis among MSMEs by announcing a targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO) of Rs 50,000 crore to help small and medium-sized non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and micro-finance institutions (MFIs).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">About 99.2% of the 132170 depositors of CKP Cooperative Bank will get their full deposits back as they are covered under the deposit insurance scheme, Reserve Bank of India said on Sunday.
The bank's license was cancelled by the RBI. It requested the registrar of cooperative societies (RCS) for the liquidation process.
"CKP Co-op Bank Ltd., Mumbai has been under All Inclusive Directions of @RBI since 2014. As there was no scope for revival of the bank, its licence has been cancelled. Out of 132170 depositors of the bank, about 99.2% will get full payment of their deposits from DICGC," a RBI spokesperson said in a social media post.
RBI has requested the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Pune, Maharashtra, to issue an order for winding up the affairs of the CKP Cooperative Bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.
Now RCS will appoint a liquidator for starting the process of giving back the deposits in consultation with Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC). The deposit insurance cover was increased to ₹5 lakh from ₹1 lakh earlier this year. The bank has a deposit base of ₹485.56 crore, as on November 2019.
RBI said CKP, which has 8 branches spread across Mumbai and Thane districts, did not satisfy the requirement of minimum capital and reserves and was not in a position to pay its present and future depositors.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">More than 99 per cent of the depositors in CKP Co-op Bank will get full payment of the deposits back from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), a senior official of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tweeted on Sunday.
The RBI cancelled the licence of CKP Co-op Bank on April 28, and notified the cancellation on its website on Saturday. It said deposits up to Rs 5 lakh are guaranteed by the DICGC. This portion is 99.2 per cent.

“CKP Co-op Bank, Mumbai, has been under the all-inclusive directions of the RBI since 2014. As there was no scope for revival of the bank, its licence has been cancelled. Out of 132,170 depositors of the bank, about 99.2 per cent will get full payment of their deposits from their DICGC,” tweeted Yogesh Dayal, chief general manager of RBI.
RBI, in a statement on Saturday, had said there was no concrete revival plan or proposal for merger with another bank and that credible commitment towards revival from the management was not visible.
The bank failed to meet the regulatory requirement of maintaining a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 9 per cent and reserves. The RBI said the lender was not in a position to pay its present and future depositors.
The affairs of the bank were being conducted in a manner detrimental to public interest and the interests of depositors, the RBI statement said. CKP Bank's NPA is more than 97 per cent as it lent to real estate players in and around Mumbai who did not pay back. The bank's total deposits was Rs 485 crore, but the net worth was a negative Rs 239 crore.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Saturday (2 May) announced the suspension of the operations of the Mumbai based CKP Co-operative Bank Limited (Ltd) and cancelled its banking licence, reports Economic Times.
The RBI said that all the depositors of the bank are entitled to repayment of their deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs five lakh under the DICGC Act, 1961 which provides the depositors with deposit insurance.
The strong decision to suspend operations and cancel the bank's license came as the RBI reasoned that the financial position of the bank was highly unsustainable and that there was no concrete revival plan or proposal for a merger with another bank.
RBI also underscored that there was no credible commitment from the management of the bank towards a course of revival. The central bank said, "The affairs of the bank were and are being conducted in a manner detrimental to the public interest and the interest of the depositors and that the general character of the management of the bank is prejudicial to the interest of depositors as also public interest."
The RBI will now go ahead with the liquidation proceedings against the bank post which the depositors would be paid with the insured sums on their deposits.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI cancels licence of CKP Cooperative Bank, cites its ‘adverse, unsustainable’ financial position</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India on Saturday said it cancelled the licence of Mumbai-based CKP Cooperative Bank, as the bank’s financial position is “highly adverse and unsustainable”. The central bank said that the affairs of the bank were being conducted in a manner detrimental to public interest. The order, passed on April 28, is effective from April 30.
“Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the CKP Co-operative Bank Limited, Mumbai, is prohibited from conducting the business of ‘banking’ which includes acceptance of deposits and repayment of deposits...” the RBI said. The central bank asked the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Pune, to issue an order for winding up the affairs of CKP Cooperative Bank. It also ordered the registrar to appoint a liquidator.
The RBI said CKP Cooperative Bank is not in a position to pay its depositors. Instead, they will be paid according to the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act, 1961. The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation can grant each depositor up to Rs 5,00,000 as repayment, the RBI said.
“The bank’s efforts for revival have been far from adequate though the bank has been given ample time and opportunity and dispensations,” the RBI said. “No merger proposal has been received in respect of the bank. Thus, in all likelihood, public interest would be adversely affected if the bank were allowed to carry on its business any further.”
As of November 2019, the total deposits of the bank amounted to Rs 485.56 crore and its loan book has Rs 161.17 crore, Mint reported.
In March, RBI had imposed a moratorium on cash-strapped Yes Bank, and restricted withdrawals at Rs 50,000 for each account. The board of directors of the bank was also superseded with immediate effect. The RBI said Yes Bank lacked a credible revival plan, and therefore it had to act in the interest of the public and depositors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">About 99.2% CKP Co-operative Bank depositors to get money back under deposit insurance: RBI</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">About 99.2 percent of the 1,32,170 depositors of CKP Co-op Bank, whose licence was cancelled on Saturday, will get their full deposits back under the deposit insurance and credit guarantee scheme (DICGC), a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) spokesperson said on May 3.
"CKP Co-op Bank Ltd, Mumbai has been under All Inclusive Directions of RBI since 2014. As there was no scope for a revival of the bank, its licence has been cancelled. Out of 1,32,170 depositors of the bank, about 99.2 percent will get full payment of their deposits from DICGC," said Yogesh Dayal, chief general manager, department of communication at RBI said in a tweet.
Under Deposit insurance scheme, on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to Rs5 lakh from DICGC. In other words, going by RBI communication, 99.2 percent of the depositors of CKP Bank are in the less than Rs 5 lakh deposit category.
As on April 30, the bank had a loan book of Rs 158 crore and deposits of Rs 486 crore. The bank had a negative net worth of Rs 239 crore, according to the latest figures available. Nearly, 97 percent of its loans had turned to NPAs, a lot of which are loans given to small and mid-sized real estate developers.
CKP Bank has its head office at Matunga, Mumbai and has eight branches spread across Mumbai and Thane districts. "The Bank has attained an important status in the co-operative banking sector, by crossing various milestones of quality and standards and by setting new standards of its own," its website says.
The lender is the latest cooperative bank to lose its licence on account of financial failure. Cancelling its licence, the RBI said that the financial position of the bank is highly adverse and unsustainable. The adverse financial position was only one of the many reasons behind the cancellation of the licence. The bank, as per RBI's observation, also did not have any concrete revival plan or proposal for a merger with another bank.Moneycontrol Ready ReckonerNow that payment deadlines have been relaxed due to COVID-19, the Moneycontrol Ready Reckoner will help keep your date with insurance premiums, tax-saving investments and EMIs, among others.Download a copy

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI cancels Mumbai-based CKP Co-op Bank's license</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Sunday said 99.2 per cent of the depositors of The CKP Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai, whose license has been cancelled, will get full payment of their deposits from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC)
As at November-end 2019, CKP Co-op Bank, as per its website, had deposits aggregating Rs 485.56 crore and loans aggregating Rs 161.17 crore. 
According to a tweet by RBI Chief General Manager Yogesh Dayal, “CKP Co-operative Bank has been under All Inclusive Directions of @RBI since 2014. As there was no scope for revival of the bank, its license has been cancelled.
“Out of 132170 depositors of the bank, about 99.2% will get full payment of their deposits from DICGC.”
The RBI, in a statement on Saturday, said the licence of The CKP Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai, has been cancelled with effect from the close of business on April 30, 2020.
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Bank is prohibited from conducting the business of ‘banking’ which includes acceptance of deposits and repayment of deposits as defined in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 with immediate effect, the central bank said in a statement.
The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Pune, Maharashtra, has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the affairs of The CKP Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai and appoint a liquidator for the bank, the central bank said in a statement.
Depositors eligible for higher deposit insurance claim
With the cancellation of licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of The CKP Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai, as per the DICGC Act, 1961 will be set in motion, it added.
On liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of ₹ 5 lakh from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) as per usual terms and conditions. 
DICGC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India, had raised the limit of insurance cover for depositors in insured banks from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh per depositor with effect from February 4, 2020 with the approval of Government of India.
The central bank said it canceled the Bank’s license as “The financial position of the bank is highly adverse and unsustainable. There is no concrete revival plan or proposal for merger with another bank. Credible commitment towards revival from the management is not visible.
“The bank is not satisfying the requirement of minimum capital and reserves…and capital adequacy and earning prospects…and also stipulated minimum regulatory capital requirement of 9 per cent.”
The central bank statement observed that the affairs of the bank were and are being conducted in a manner detrimental to the public interest and interest of the depositors and that the general character of the management of the bank is prejudicial to the interest of depositors as also public interest. Thus, the bank has not been complying with provisions of Section 22 (3)(b) and (c) Banking Regulation Act.
“The bank’s efforts for revival have been far from adequate though the bank has been given ample time and opportunity and dispensations. No merger proposal has been received in respect of the bank. Thus, in all likelihood, public interest would be adversely affected if the bank were allowed to carry on its business any further.
“No useful purpose would be served by allowing the bank to continue as envisaged in Section 22(3)(e) of the Act. Rather, Public interest would be adversely affected if the bank is allowed to carry on its banking business any further,” the RBI said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A mind-boggling 30 million people have filed for unemployment in 6 weeks. There are likely more without jobs., Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Job loss stemming from the coronavirus pandemic has been devastating. Economists think there are likely more without jobs that haven’t been captured by the data.
What has been reported so far paints a gloomy picture. In just six weeks, 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurance. Each weekly report since mid-March has been in the millions – multiple times higher than the worst week of the Great Recession, when 665,000 filed for unemployment insurance.
It took only four weeks of the coronavirus pandemic to erase all jobs created since the Great Recession. Now, there are millions more unemployed, signaling that the economic downturn from the coronavirus pandemic will be severe.
As terrible as the job loss numbers are, they are only part of the picture. There could be more Americans unemployed, according to economists, as not everyone who lost work has been able to file for benefits.

A survey conducted in mid-April by the Economic Policy Institute found that for every 10 people who successfully filed a claim for unemployment insurance, three to four tried to file but were unable to get through the system. In addition, two more didn’t try to apply for UI at all because it was too difficult.
“These findings imply the official count of unemployment insurance claims likely drastically understates the extent of employment reductions and the need for economic relief during the coronavirus crisis,” wrote Ben Zipperer and Elise Gould of the EPI.
Accounting for the workers who were unable to apply for unemployment, or tried but didn’t get through, the EPI survey found that only about half of potential UI applicants are actually receiving benefits.

Applying those findings to the five weeks of unemployment claims from March 15 to April 18, the EPI estimates an additional 8.9 million to 13.9 million could have filed for claims if the process had been easier.
To be sure, unemployment benefits have been expanded to include more Americans than ever before. The CARES Act signed into law by President Donald Trump at the end of March extended unemployment benefits to millions of Americans who would’ve been otherwise ineligible, including gig workers, freelancers, and those who are self-employed.
This is important, because these groups of non-traditional workers have expanded in the last decade. In 2019, 35% of the workforce freelanced, or 57 million people, up from 53 million in 2014, according to a survey by the Freelancers Union. The share of gig workers at US businesses has grown 15% since 2010, a study from the ADP Research Institute showed.
But, there have been problems implementing the new program established by the CARES Act, called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. At the end of April, only 21 states had started paying out benefits to self-employed and gig workers, according to the Labor Department.

And, states have been delayed in taking in claims filed for the program. Florida, for example, did not begin accepting applications under PUA until Tuesday, Politico reported.
In mid-April, the new system Pennsylvania put in place for PUA crashed due to a flood of new applications, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported Thursday. New York’s system crashed as well following a huge surge in claims, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a briefing April 21.
There are also quirks in the data calculation and collection that sometimes yield results that may not show the full picture. Next week, the April jobs report will be released, including nonfarm payroll information and an updated unemployment rate.
As of April 18, economists estimated that the unemployment rate likely spiked to about 20.2% given the surge in UI claims. The next week, however, economists forecast an unemployment rate of 16%, even though claims rose by 3.8 million.
This is not because the situation has gotten any better; it’s instead the way the data is calculated. To be included in the unemployment count, people have to say that they are actively looking for work. Under the expanded benefits from the CARES Act, people do not have to be actively looking for employment to receive a check, and because of the health crisis, many have put job searches on hold.
That technically lowers the unemployment rate, meaning what will be reported for April could be an underrepresentation of how many people are actually out of work in the US.

There could also be further issues with the survey, which depends on the people filling it out to accurately answer questions about employment. Sometimes, as with any survey, respondents don’t interpret or answer the questions as intended.
In March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that the unemployment rate would’ve been one percentage point higher – 5.4% instead of 4.4% – if those who marked themselves temporarily absent from work due to “other reasons” had said they were unemployed on temporary layoff.
The consequences of such widespread unemployment are dire. Current data shows about one in five American workers is without a job, and as UI claims continue to roll in in the millions, the share will increase.
If the alarming rate of layoffs continues, it’s likely that about half of American workers will be without a paycheck in May, according to ING international economist James Knightley.
It’s widely accepted that the US is in a recession, especially after first-quarter gross domestic product fell at a 4.8% annualized rate before the worst months of the coronavirus crisis.
Now, economists are weighing what type of recovery may take place. The sweeping unemployment is foreboding, given that US consumption is roughly 70% of GDP. The longer that workers go without paychecks, the longer it will take for the economy to recover.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A mind-boggling 30 million people have filed for unemployment in 6 weeks. There are likely more without jobs.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Job loss stemming from the coronavirus pandemic has been devastating. Economists think there are likely more without jobs that haven't been captured by the data. 
What has been reported so far paints a gloomy picture. In just six weeks, 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurance. Each weekly report since mid-March has been in the millions — multiple times higher than the worst week of the Great Recession, when 665,000 filed for unemployment insurance. 
It took only four weeks of the coronavirus pandemic to erase all jobs created since the Great Recession. Now, there are millions more unemployed, signaling that the economic downturn from the coronavirus pandemic will be severe. 
As terrible as the job loss numbers are, they are only part of the picture. There could be more Americans unemployed, according to economists, as not everyone who lost work has been able to file for benefits.

A survey conducted in mid-April by the Economic Policy Institute found that for every 10 people who successfully filed a claim for unemployment insurance, three to four tried to file but were unable to get through the system. In addition, two more didn't try to apply for UI at all because it was too difficult. 
"These findings imply the official count of unemployment insurance claims likely drastically understates the extent of employment reductions and the need for economic relief during the coronavirus crisis," wrote Ben Zipperer and Elise Gould of the EPI. 
Accounting for the workers who were unable to apply for unemployment, or tried but didn't get through, the EPI survey found that only about half of potential UI applicants are actually receiving benefits.

Applying those findings to the five weeks of unemployment claims from March 15 to April 18, the EPI estimates an additional 8.9 million to 13.9 million could have filed for claims if the process had been easier. 
To be sure, unemployment benefits have been expanded to include more Americans than ever before. The CARES Act signed into law by President Donald Trump at the end of March extended unemployment benefits to millions of Americans who would've been otherwise ineligible, including gig workers, freelancers, and those who are self-employed. 
This is important, because these groups of non-traditional workers have expanded in the last decade. In 2019, 35% of the workforce freelanced, or 57 million people, up from 53 million in 2014, according to a survey by the Freelancers Union. The share of gig workers at US businesses has grown 15% since 2010, a study from the ADP Research Institute showed.
But, there have been problems implementing the new program established by the CARES Act, called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. At the end of April, only 21 states had started paying out benefits to self-employed and gig workers, according to the Labor Department.

And, states have been delayed in taking in claims filed for the program. Florida, for example, did not begin accepting applications under PUA until Tuesday, Politico reported.
In mid-April, the new system Pennsylvania put in place for PUA crashed due to a flood of new applications, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported Thursday. New York's system crashed as well following a huge surge in claims, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a briefing April 21. 
There are also quirks in the data calculation and collection that sometimes yield results that may not show the full picture. Next week, the April jobs report will be released, including nonfarm payroll information and an updated unemployment rate. 
As of April 18, economists estimated that the unemployment rate likely spiked to about 20.2% given the surge in UI claims. The next week, however, economists forecast an unemployment rate of 16%, even though claims rose by 3.8 million.
This is not because the situation has gotten any better; it's instead the way the data is calculated. To be included in the unemployment count, people have to say that they are actively looking for work. Under the expanded benefits from the CARES Act, people do not have to be actively looking for employment to receive a check, and because of the health crisis, many have put job searches on hold.   
That technically lowers the unemployment rate, meaning what will be reported for April could be an underrepresentation of how many people are actually out of work in the US.

There could also be further issues with the survey, which depends on the people filling it out to accurately answer questions about employment. Sometimes, as with any survey, respondents don't interpret or answer the questions as intended. 
In March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that the unemployment rate would've been one percentage point higher — 5.4% instead of 4.4% — if those who marked themselves temporarily absent from work due to "other reasons" had said they were unemployed on temporary layoff. 
The consequences of such widespread unemployment are dire. Current data shows about one in five American workers is without a job, and as UI claims continue to roll in in the millions, the share will increase.
If the alarming rate of layoffs continues, it's likely that about half of American workers will be without a paycheck in May, according to ING international economist James Knightley. 
It's widely accepted that the US is in a recession, especially after first-quarter gross domestic product fell at a 4.8% annualized rate before the worst months of the coronavirus crisis.
Now, economists are weighing what type of recovery may take place. The sweeping unemployment is foreboding, given that US consumption is roughly 70% of GDP. The longer that workers go without paychecks, the longer it will take for the economy to recover.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wine businesses and smaller restaurants are getting creative to stay afloat, according to a master sommelier — but even as alcohol purchases boom the industry needs our support</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With a substantial amount of lockdown time under our belts, people around the world have found creative ways to remain social, active, and entertained. Virtual cocktail hours and dinner parties, live educational tastings, and all-around beverage discourse are filling social media airwaves.
There is no way to replace genuine human interactions: a necessity for a healthy life. However, this crisis has reminded many of us that at the center of human contact often lies a great drink.
And continuing to drink well, learn well, and do well by the wine industry in this time is not only possible, but imperative. 
Over the past decade, wine has seen a growth in consumer demand for information and validation. With the rise in popularity of the sommelier profession, access to expert advice has grown, such as on SommTV. Winemakers, retail buyers, trained sommeliers, wine journalists, and enthusiast influencers have all become more prominent, widening a previously narrow field of critics whose scores focused on retail shelves and an endless sea of Yelp-like reviews on wine apps like Vivino.
Consumers seek greater interactivity and down-to-earth advice (try Crunchy Red Fruit or SommSelect). Restaurants remain the treasure trove, attracting enthusiasts of all levels looking to quench their thirst for wine experiences at restaurants.  
Enter COVID-19. Since the novel coronavirus took hold, alcohol sales in the US have actually boomed. So much so that the first 30 days of quarantine resembled the alcohol-fuelled holiday mania of December.
But almost all that business is being funnelled through established retail supply chains; a small percentage of restaurants and bars are attempting to create in-home experiences to stay afloat. This all goes beyond the sudden deluge of social media hashtags like #quarantinecocktail — this is about supporting an industry that is at risk of faltering.
For restaurants without an already-established retail arm, creativity and agility have been the only ways to survive. Robust social media marketing supported by rich online content is the key for these businesses to tap into the current retail boom. 
Master Sommelier Laura Fiorvanti — one of 35 women in the world with this prestigious title — leads Corkbuzz group. Based in New York and North Carolina, she is taking their offerings online. With streamed versions of her in-house tastings matched with wine packs that can be purchased and shipped from the Corkbuzz cellar, she's turning what was once thought of as an in-person-only event into something that's not only more affordable, but also can be done in your own home.  
National retailer and Vermont wine bar Dedalus has also curated a wide variety of online entertainment that traverses everything from one-on-one happy hours with notable sommeliers to foundational lessons on cheese and its best pairings to fun-loving wine and DJ sets.   
The New York branch of La Compagnie de Vins Surnaturels, with managing partner Caleb Ganzer, has taken to YouTube with their in-house "Wine Boot Camp," popular with the millennial drinker given that they have over 1,000 people log on at a time, and are able to deliver featured wines to the local area thanks to temporary retail licenses being made available to restaurants. (States have banned the on-premise sale and consumption of food and alcohol, they authorized take-away and delivery retail sales for all current liquor license holders.)
For other restaurants looking for ways to thrive through the pandemic, focusing on the in-home experience is key. Whether it's a ready-to cook dinner paired with beverages, individually bottled cocktails, or working with sommeliers and winemakers to create video wine tastings, there needs to be an effort to engage with people in their homes.
Though it may be too soon to tell what combination of virtual content will allow some to surge forward, what is clear is the need to help preserve the restaurant world. Stark numbers overshadow the hope that some restaurants have. According to the Independent Restaurant Coalition and the James Beard Foundation, over 500,000 restaurants have closed temporarily, causing the loss of over 11 million jobs. Only 20% of those closed restaurants believe they'll be able to afford to come back once the new normal sets in.
While a few economic thinkers believe this will just result in a great re-shuffling, others fear that it will expedite the homogenization of American restaurants: a patchwork of individual small businesses that represents the largest private industry employer in the US. 
Large, online-only retailers have seen the largest spike in their revenue during the novel coronavirus era, jumping three-figure percentage points in just days. They represent big discounts on large-production wines and a low-risk comfort zone — purchasing that arrives at your door with zero human interaction. It's these inherent pillars that big businesses are built on, and it's working.  
If there was ever a moment to support small business, now is the time.
All restaurants were deemed as essential businesses. If they haven't shuttered, takeout food and beverage is the only way they are surviving. If someone wants to buy a bottle of wine, check out what is available at a local restaurant first, then a local wine shop.
Some restaurants have turned into grocers that support local farms and butchers. Anything bought here will be fresher and of better quality than what would be found at a supermarket. Lastly, if looking to donate, Frontline Foods and the Independent Restaurant Coalition are the most secure and effective avenues.
If you can think of a restaurant or small retail shop where you thoroughly enjoyed their hospitality, then seek out that place and patronize them. Chances are, they're scrambling to pack wine and food to-go orders so they can one day reopen their doors and welcome you home.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wine businesses and smaller restaurants are getting creative to stay afloat, according to a master sommelier — but even as alcohol purchases boom the industry needs our support</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With a substantial amount of lockdown time under our belts, people around the world have found creative ways to remain social, active, and entertained. Virtual cocktail hours and dinner parties, live educational tastings, and all-around beverage discourse are filling social media airwaves.
There is no way to replace genuine human interactions: a necessity for a healthy life. However, this crisis has reminded many of us that at the center of human contact often lies a great drink.
And continuing to drink well, learn well, and do well by the wine industry in this time is not only possible, but imperative.
Over the past decade, wine has seen a growth in consumer demand for information and validation. With the rise in popularity of the sommelier profession, access to expert advice has grown, such as on SommTV. Winemakers, retail buyers, trained sommeliers, wine journalists, and enthusiast influencers have all become more prominent, widening a previously narrow field of critics whose scores focused on retail shelves and an endless sea of Yelp-like reviews on wine apps like Vivino.
Consumers seek greater interactivity and down-to-earth advice (try Crunchy Red Fruit or SommSelect). Restaurants remain the treasure trove, attracting enthusiasts of all levels looking to quench their thirst for wine experiences at restaurants.
Enter COVID-19. Since the novel coronavirus took hold, alcohol sales in the US have actually boomed. So much so that the first 30 days of quarantine resembled the alcohol-fuelled holiday mania of December.
But almost all that business is being funnelled through established retail supply chains; a small percentage of restaurants and bars are attempting to create in-home experiences to stay afloat. This all goes beyond the sudden deluge of social media hashtags like #quarantinecocktail – this is about supporting an industry that is at risk of faltering.
For restaurants without an already-established retail arm, creativity and agility have been the only ways to survive. Robust social media marketing supported by rich online content is the key for these businesses to tap into the current retail boom.
Master Sommelier Laura Fiorvanti – one of 35 women in the world with this prestigious title – leads Corkbuzz group. Based in New York and North Carolina, she is taking their offerings online. With streamed versions of her in-house tastings matched with wine packs that can be purchased and shipped from the Corkbuzz cellar, she’s turning what was once thought of as an in-person-only event into something that’s not only more affordable, but also can be done in your own home.
National retailer and Vermont wine bar Dedalus has also curated a wide variety of online entertainment that traverses everything from one-on-one happy hours with notable sommeliers to foundational lessons on cheese and its best pairings to fun-loving wine and DJ sets.
The New York branch of La Compagnie de Vins Surnaturels, with managing partner Caleb Ganzer, has taken to YouTube with their in-house “Wine Boot Camp,” popular with the millennial drinker given that they have over 1,000 people log on at a time, and are able to deliver featured wines to the local area thanks to temporary retail licenses being made available to restaurants. (States have banned the on-premise sale and consumption of food and alcohol, they authorized take-away and delivery retail sales for all current liquor license holders.)
For other restaurants looking for ways to thrive through the pandemic, focusing on the in-home experience is key. Whether it’s a ready-to cook dinner paired with beverages, individually bottled cocktails, or working with sommeliers and winemakers to create video wine tastings, there needs to be an effort to engage with people in their homes.
Though it may be too soon to tell what combination of virtual content will allow some to surge forward, what is clear is the need to help preserve the restaurant world. Stark numbers overshadow the hope that some restaurants have. According to the Independent Restaurant Coalition and the James Beard Foundation, over 500,000 restaurants have closed temporarily, causing the loss of over 11 million jobs. Only 20% of those closed restaurants believe they’ll be able to afford to come back once the new normal sets in.
While a few economic thinkers believe this will just result in a great re-shuffling, others fear that it will expedite the homogenization of American restaurants: a patchwork of individual small businesses that represents the largest private industry employer in the US.
Large, online-only retailers have seen the largest spike in their revenue during the novel coronavirus era, jumping three-figure percentage points in just days. They represent big discounts on large-production wines and a low-risk comfort zone – purchasing that arrives at your door with zero human interaction. It’s these inherent pillars that big businesses are built on, and it’s working.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON — A government-backed loan scheme to help Britain’s small businesses survive the coronavirus lockdown comes into effect on Monday, allowing firms such as hairdressing salons, coffee shops and florists to receive emergency cash.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak, who previously opposed 100% state backing for commercial loans, announced the new facility on April 27, bowing to pressure to do more for the smallest companies after a previous scheme got off to a slow start.
The new “Bounce Back Loans” allow businesses including sole traders to borrow between 2,000 and 50,000 pounds ($2,500-$62,500) at a flat interest rate of 2.5%. Banks handling the loans will not be required to run credit checks or assess the long-term viability of applicants.
“Small businesses will play a key role creating jobs and securing economic growth as we recover from the coronavirus pandemic,” Sunak said in a statement to mark the first day when the Bounce Back scheme goes into operation.
“The Bounce Back loan scheme will make sure they get the finance they need – helping them bounce back and protect jobs,” he said.
Most British businesses have been shut to the public since March 23, when the government imposed social distancing measures to slow the spread of the virus. Government forecasters have said the economy could contract by 35% in the second quarter.
Britain last month announced an emergency 330 billion-pound credit scheme including loans of up to 5 million pounds for small and medium-sized companies, with state guarantees of 80%.
But many companies said they struggled to secure bank approvals, putting pressure on Sunak to provide full state guarantees for commercial loans to the smallest businesses.
From Monday, any firm that has already taken out a loan of 50,000 pounds or less under the 80%-state-backed scheme can apply to have it switched over to the Bounce Back scheme.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: Government to outline further measures to help businesses</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Government is to outline further measures to support businesses impacted by COVID-19.
The Ministers for Finance, Business and Housing - Paschal Donohoe, Heather Humphreys and Eoghan Murphy - are to give further details on Saturday.
It follows on from the publication by the Government of theroadmap for easing restrictions and re-opening the economy.
Chambers Ireland chief executive Ian Talbot said: "The past several weeks have been tremendously challenging for communities, so indications that some restrictions will be eased in the coming days will be warmly received."
"Chambers Ireland reiterates its call for liquidity funds and grant aid for business to cover overheads such as rent, utilities and working capital.
"The deferral announced in March was found to be insufficient by three-quarters of business who responded to our earlier survey published on May 9th.
"If action on commercial rates is to have any meaningful impact, they will need to be waived for impacted businesses for at least six months, if not a full year."
He added: "Without additional aid to support working capital, liquidity and cash flow, the chance of businesses successfully re-opening and maintaining employment is significantly reduced. We await Government clarity on these matters over the weekend."
Earlier this week, Minister Donohoe told Newstalk that COVID-19 payments and wage subsidy schemes could not continue indefinitely.
He said: "We cannot sustain this indefinitely - these are interventions that are costing between €200m and €400m per week.
"And what I will do now in the coming weeks... is will explain the future of a scheme like that.
"The two principles I have is number one: we cannot sustain this indefinitely - but I also know turning it off abruptly will undo much of the good work that we've put in place.
"And then secondly, to try and change it in a way that ties in with income and jobs recovering in our country".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Commercial rates waiver and €10k restart grants: Government outlines supports to try help businesses recover</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THE GOVERNMENT HAS agreed a series of measures at a special Cabinet meeting today to support small, medium and large businesses recover after the impact of Covid-19.
After the announcement of the phased reopening of the Irish economy, the government said today it “recognises that businesses require significant additional supports”. 
Businesses who were forced to cease trading and others affected adversely from Covid-19 had been calling on the government to provide supports to help them deal with the unprecedented crisis. 
The measures to support business announced today include:
Speaking today, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said that he appreciates “the massive economic and social challenges” for those out of work and said these measures today would help to rebuild “our jobs, our incomes and our economic health”. 
He added: “We believe these are significant measures that will make a difference to the retention of jobs, and the creation of new jobs.”
On the specific call from pubs, restaurants and tourism sectors to reduce the VAT rate on the hospitality industry, Minister Donohoe said a decision had not been taken on that measure yet as – according to the roadmap - it’ll be some time before they reopen. 
The measures will cost around €6.5 billion in all.
The government has also committed to local authorities to make up the shortfall on rates, so that these local authorities can still provide services to the public.
Minister for Business Heather Humphreys said: “We now have a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst our SMEs.”
Humphreys said advice from Health and Safety Authority is available to those businesses looking to ensure they can enforce health guidelines when they go back to work.
SME credit supports
The credit guarantee scheme for SMEs will cost €2 billion. 
Under this scheme, it’ll provide an 80% guarantee on leding to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between three months to six years. 
SMEs will be able to go directly to the banks in the Scheme, and the guarantee can be used for a wide range of lending products between €10,000 and €1 million.
The loans will have interest rates below current market rates, and the government said this is a “major component” of its strategy to support SMEs.
It will require legislation, and the drafting of this has already been approved. However, for legislation to pass, a new government must be formed as the Seanad cannot sit until the new Taoiseach nominates new members to the upper house.
Minister Donohoe acknowledged this was the case, and said a number of decisions had been made and would be made that would have to be ratified by the Dáil and the Seanad. 
Reaction
Business group IBEC said it welcomed the measures announced by government today.
Its CEO Danny McCoy said: “The scale of business collapse in recent weeks has been spectacular and unprecedented and the significant low interest loan guarantee; other liquidity and investment measures; grants; and tax deferral and waiver supports; are an important further step in addressing the cashflow crisis which so many businesses are dealing with.
Dublin Chamber and the Small Firms Association were among others who welcomed the measures.
However, the Family Business Network however said the measures are a “missed opportunity to maximise jobs and accelerate re-employment”.
Its executive director John McGrane said: “Neither more loans nor unworkable state equity investment are what businesses need to reopen and re-hire. What will get the recovery moving fastest is the extension of the Covid-19 Temporary Wage Supplement Scheme until a reasonable period after the State’s current restrictions on businesses are ended.”
Fianna Fáil’s Business spokesperson said while the measures unveiled today will provide some relief for businesses, they do not tackle the very urgent need to address the high interest rate being charged on government loans, business interruption insurance and rent payments.  
“I have been listening to and working with business owners since these restrictions were implemented and three of the main issues that came up time and again was access to low interest loans, insurance and rent.  And unfortunately, today’s government announcement does little to address any of these.
“Today’s measures do not address the high interest rate that the government is charging on its microfinance and loan guarantee schemes.  These offer rates of around 4%; despite the fact that government can borrow at rates of less than 0.25%.  Small and medium businesses are paying the price at a time when they cannot afford to,” he said. 
When put to the Minster Humphreys that some government loans in the UK have interest rates as low as 2.5% she said the full suite of measures on offer must be viewed together before comparisons can be made. She said they would continue to monitor the supports put forward by other countries.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Commercial rates are to be waived for three months for business impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The shortfall of €260m on local authorities is to be funded by the Government.
The Government had already brought forward a series of measures to support those impacted by the pandemic - including emergency income support such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.
They have now introduced a number of additional measures to aid the economy as the Covid-19 restrictions start to be lifted.
A €6bn support package for farmers, small, medium and larger businesses has been agreed by Cabinet.
It includes allowing companies to get a low-interest rate loan to re-open their business.

Finance minister Paschal Donohoe said the measures are designed to “minimise the damage” of the pandemic.
Minister Donohoe said: “Covid-19 has created a world that none of us could have imagined just a few short weeks ago. Our collective public health has been targeted; our businesses, and our economy, have been shouldered with an unimaginable burden; and our society is grappling with this new reality.
.
"But, by working together, we are minimising the damage. The hard work of the Irish people has ensured that we are getting to grips with this disease, our people are united in caring for one another under the most extreme of circumstances and our businesses are attempting to adapt to this new and most challenging environment.
“On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.

"We will continue to seek the best ways of supporting our people, and wider society, and rebuilding our economy so that we can get people back to work safely. We will do this by being cognisant of official public health advice and doing what is in the best interests of all our people.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Irish government announces measures to support business struggling with pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Irish Government has announced a suite of measures to help businesses struggling in the coronavirus emergency.
Multi-euro recovery funds were agreed in a special cabinet meeting the morning after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced a five-stage road map to reopening society.
The measures include a two billion euro pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund and a two billion euro Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from three months to six years.
A 10,000 euro restart grant for micro and small businesses, a three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses, the “warehousing” of tax liabilities for 12 months after recommencement of trading and a commitment to local authorities to make up the rates shortfall were also announced.
Finance minister Paschal Donohoe said the measures are designed to “minimise the damage” of the pandemic.
“Our collective public health has been targeted; our businesses and our economy have been shouldered with an unimaginable burden; and our society is grappling with this new reality. But, by working together, we are minimising the damage,” he said.
“On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.”
The Government has already rolled out a multibillion-euro package of assistance for employers and workers during the crisis.
Around 450,000 workers are receiving state payments through a temporary wage subsidy scheme, while around another 600,000 have applied for a special Covid-19 unemployment benefit.
The Government has also significantly expanded financial support for small and medium sized-businesses.
On Friday, Mr Varadkar announced the current lockdown has been extended until May 18, at which point phase one of the “journey to a new normal” will commence.
Each stage is three weeks apart, but the country will only move from one to the other when medical experts confirm it is safe to do so.
The fifth phase is scheduled to commence on August 10 if everything goes to plan.
While the majority of restrictions remain in place for another fortnight, two will ease in the coming days.
From next Tuesday, a travel limit that has forced people to stay within 2km of home when exercising will be extended to 5km, and self-isolating over-70s will be advised they can leave home for a walk or drive.
On May 18, outdoor work, like construction and landscaping, will resume.
Some retail outlets – like garden centres, hardware stores and repair shops – will also reopen.
Mr Varadkar said some outdoor sporting and fitness activities in small groups would also be allowed from that date.
Cafes and restaurants are set to reopen in phase three, which will start on June 29, but pubs are not due to reopen until phase five.
Phase four, which will start on July 20, will see hotels and hairdressers opening for business.
In terms of sport, golf and tennis will be permitted in phase one while close-contact sports such as rugby will have to wait until phase five on August 10.
Mr Varadkar has expressed hope that the show-piece All-Ireland GAA finals could go ahead this autumn, albeit behind closed doors.
In phase one, people outside of the same family unit can meet in groups of no more than four in an outdoor setting.
In phase two, starting June 8, visits to the homes of over-70s and other vulnerable groups will be permitted with strict social distancing and hygiene steps.
The plan does not include any timescale for lifting the cocooning advice.
Mr Varadkar said advice on wearing face masks or coverings in shops and public transport would be issued when the plan begins to roll out on May 18.
Mr Varadkar said schools and colleges will reopen in September/October at the start of the new academic year.
Education authorities are to assess whether Leaving Cert exams for final-year students could go ahead in July in the absence of the wider school population.
Mr Varadkar said it was still the plan for sixth year students to spend two weeks in class ahead of the exams starting.
But he said other options, such as using predictive marking to allocate results, may be needed if sitting the Leaving Certs could not be held safely.
The five phase plan was agreed by Cabinet on the back of advice from experts on the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).
The current lockdown period had been due to expire on Monday.
The Taoiseach has stressed the blueprint is a “living document” and steps outlined in later phases could potentially be implemented sooner.
He also predicted that the two-metre social distancing guidelines could be reduced, potentially by half.
The total number of people who have died from Covid-19 in Ireland rose to 1,265 on Friday, after another 34 deaths were announced.
As of Friday, there had been 20,833 confirmed cases of the disease.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New €6bn package of measures to help firms post-COVID</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Commercial rates are to be waived for three months for business impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
A shortfall of €260m on local authorities is to be funded by the Government.
It is part of a new package of supports worth over €6bn agreed by Cabinet.
It includes allowing companies to get a low-interest rate loan to re-open their business.
The measures were agreed at a special Saturday Cabinet meeting, following the publication on Friday of a roadmap for re-opening business.
The Government has already brought forward a series of measures - such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment - but says it is now necessary to introduce a number of additional measures.
Those include a €10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates/waiver rebate from 2019.
A €2bn Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund will also be available within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF).
This will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms.
While a €2bn COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme will also support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from three months to six years with below market interest rates.
It will also see the ‘warehousing’ of tax liabilities for a period of 12 months after trading recommences.
During this time, the Government says there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue, and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.
The Revenue Commissioners confirmed that COVID-19 related VAT and payroll tax debts - due March 1st to the date when sectoral restrictions are lifted - will be parked for a period of 12 months.
It also said no interest will accrue on the tax debts during this 12 month period.
And after that period, the related tax debts will carry a reduced interest rate of 3%  - down from 10% - until the debt is paid.
Revenue added: "The timeframe allowed to pay the ‘warehoused’ debt will be flexible and determined by the ability of the business to pay both COVID-19 related debts as well meeting its ongoing tax liabilities as they arise in the normal course".
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said: "On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.
"We will do this by being cognisant of official public health advice and doing what is in the best interests of all our people."
Business Minister Heather Humphreys said: "We now have a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst our SMEs.
“The new €250m Restart Fund in particular will be a critically important tool to support small businesses in our towns and villages to re-open their doors and get back on their feet with supports of up to €10,000 available."
And Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy added: "The commercial rates waiver is an important response from Government.
"This will provide relief to impacted businesses as well as certainty to local authorities as to their funding.
"Rates alleviation will be complemented by the establishment of a Restart Fund for micro and small businesses which would provide a further €250m to support ratepayers."

The measures include a €2 billion pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund and a €2 billion Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from three months to six years.
A €10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses, a three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses, the “warehousing” of tax liabilities for 12 months after recommencement of trading and a commitment to local authorities to make up the rates shortfall were also announced.
The Republic's finance minister Paschal Donohoe said the measures are designed to “minimise the damage” of the pandemic.
“Our collective public health has been targeted; our businesses and our economy have been shouldered with an unimaginable burden; and our society is grappling with this new reality. But, by working together, we are minimising the damage,” he said.
“On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.”
The Irish government has already rolled out a multibillion-euro package of assistance for employers and workers during the crisis.
Around 450,000 workers are receiving state payments through a temporary wage subsidy scheme, while around another 600,000 have applied for a special Covid-19 unemployment benefit.
The Government has also significantly expanded financial support for small and medium sized-businesses.
On Friday, Mr Varadkar announced the current lockdown has been extended until May 18, at which point phase one of the “journey to a new normal” will commence.
Each stage is three weeks apart, but the country will only move from one to the other when medical experts confirm it is safe to do so.
The fifth phase is scheduled to commence on August 10 if everything goes to plan.
While the majority of restrictions remain in place for another fortnight, two will ease in the coming days.
From next Tuesday, a travel limit that has forced people to stay within 2km of home when exercising will be extended to 5km, and self-isolating over-70s will be advised they can leave home for a walk or drive.
On May 18, outdoor work, like construction and landscaping, will resume.
Some retail outlets – like garden centres, hardware stores and repair shops – will also reopen.
Mr Varadkar said some outdoor sporting and fitness activities in small groups would also be allowed from that date.
Cafes and restaurants are set to reopen in phase three, which will start on June 29, but pubs are not due to reopen until phase five.
Phase four, which will start on July 20, will see hotels and hairdressers opening for business.
In terms of sport, golf and tennis will be permitted in phase one while close-contact sports such as rugby will have to wait until phase five on August 10.
Mr Varadkar has expressed hope that the show-piece All-Ireland GAA finals could go ahead this autumn, albeit behind closed doors.
In phase one, people outside of the same family unit can meet in groups of no more than four in an outdoor setting.
In phase two, starting June 8, visits to the homes of over-70s and other vulnerable groups will be permitted with strict social distancing and hygiene steps.
The plan does not include any timescale for lifting the cocooning advice.
Mr Varadkar said advice on wearing face masks or coverings in shops and public transport would be issued when the plan begins to roll out on May 18.
Mr Varadkar said schools and colleges will reopen in September/October at the start of the new academic year.
Education authorities are to assess whether Leaving Cert exams for final-year students could go ahead in July in the absence of the wider school population.
Mr Varadkar said it was still the plan for sixth year students to spend two weeks in class ahead of the exams starting.

    <h5 class="mb-1">State goes big in effort to help businesses struggling through shutdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Many businesses will have been taken aback by the long timetable for reopening set out by the Government on Friday. However, the programme of new supports announced on Saturday is significant and tries to address the needs of different types of businesses, many now facing a longer closure period than expected and an unprecedented cash squeeze.
Some of this, including a new credit guarantee scheme and further Revenue forbearance on taxes, requires new legislation and will therefore not be finalised until a new Government is in place.
The cost of Covid-19 in terms of additional Government spending is rising sharply. The latest package commits another €6.5 billion in supports to business. Add another €8 billion already committed through wage and income subsidies and higher health spending, and the total is now between €14 billion and €15 billion, or about 7 per cent of national income. An unprecedented crisis has required an unprecedented support programme.
That said, the final exchequer cost of the latest measures will be much less in the long term; a lot of the warehoused taxes will be repaid, not all credit guarantees will be called in and some investments will generate a return.
Still, it will push State borrowing higher and we will be reliant on the European Central Bank’s presence in the markets to help us raise funds at rock-bottom interest rates. This is a vital part of the economic calculation for Ireland in the months ahead.

The financial supports for business announced on Saturday follow the significant wage subsidy scheme, which is helping cover payroll costs. With ongoing fixed costs, many firms are facing a cash crisis and, if not addressed, it will turn into a solvency crisis and threaten their future.
The new schemes announced attempt to address this. A key part of the plan – a credit guarantee scheme committing more than €2 billion – requires new legislation, and it appears this is not possible until a new government is formed and a new taoiseach puts their nominees into the Seanad. With doubts over whether talk to form a government will succeed, this threatens to leave key parts of the plan hanging in mid-air for a prolonged period. It further ups the pressure to form a new government.Decisions on how to respond to demands for VAT cuts for restaurants and hospitality will also fall to a new government.
The schemes fall into a few different headings. The credit guarantee scheme is a vital element, assisting companies to get access to bank loans. This adds to existing credit supports, which have had slow enough draw-downs. Some details remain to be outlined, including the cost – which we are told will be below market rates. This is an important part of the plan to help SMEs, and banks need to be prepared to lend on the basis of the 80 per cent guarantee. Some tweaks in the rules will help.
The other big ticket item is a €2 billion fund to be run by the Irish Strategic Investment Fund to invest in medium and larger businesses, defined as those with more than €50 million in turnover or more than 250 employees. These are designed to be investments on commercial terms to help bigger firms through the crisis. The Government is conscious, according to Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, of controversy in other countries over big business taking state support and then paying out money to shareholders or management. Steps are promised to avoid this happening here. As we know from past history, this is a tricky area for Government and managing this will be challenging and potentially controversial.
The other actions involve an extension of measures already in place, including a significant extension of Revenue forbearance (legislation will also be necessary here) and a sensible move to waive rates for three months for firms which have had to shut.
A €250 million restart fund for micro and small businesses will be launched and designed to give them cash support to help restart, based on a refund and waiver of rates from 2019. This will be essential for many of the smallest firms, though the limit of €10,000 may need to be lifted a bit given the pressure many firms are under and the costs of restarting. In time, more cash may be needed here.
Businesses generally welcomed the proposals, although they will look for quick clarification on detail. Given the extended nature of the reopening announced on Friday, the new measures were even more essential as many firms will remain shut for well beyond the 12 weeks initially envisaged. The Government also faces vital decisions on how to extend wage supports beyond this initial 12-week timeline . The business support programme may be amended or added to, but a significant amount of cash is now committed to try to save business and jobs. The next challenge is to get all this operational and get the restart going.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK pledges extra funds for businesses that share office space</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The government has pledged a further £617m in grants to small businesses, seeking to plug gaps in a scheme that has left thousands of companies unable to access much-needed finance. 
The additional funds will go to “businesses in shared spaces, regular market traders, small charity properties that would meet the criteria for Small Business Rates Relief, and bed and breakfasts that pay council tax rather than business rates,” the government said. 
The funds add to a £12.33bn pot that has already been made available through the small business grants fund and the retail, hospitality and leisure grants fund. 
Many small businesses were excluded from the original scheme, which based eligibility on whether companies paid business rates. 
Before Saturday’s announcement, a payout of £10,000 was available to businesses operating out of premises that have a ratable value — a measure of the rental value of the property — of up to £15,000. Companies in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors with a ratable value of between £15,000 and £51,000 can apply for a £25,000 grant.
Many small businesses do not pay business rates. More than 10,000 companies based in shared offices originally missed out on the grant because their premises had not been assigned a ratable value by the Valuation Office Agency, according to research from property firm Colliers.
In shared offices, such as those operated by WeWork and IWG, regular reconfigurations mean the VOA has not always assessed individual units.

The original design of the scheme meant money could be delivered quickly, but it came at the expense of comprehensive cover for companies in need, according to John Webber, head of business rates at Colliers. 
“The easiest way to get to 95 per cent of businesses was using the criteria from the business rates system that was in place. But there are 5 per cent missing out,” he said.
The additional funding should address those “anomalies” said Robert Hayton, head of UK business rates at the real estate adviser Altus Group.
The additional £617m raises the total funds available by 5 per cent.
The grants will be a lifeline for the million or so small businesses in the UK that have been forced to shut as a result of coronavirus, many of which are paying rent on office premises they cannot access. But they need to be delivered swiftly, said Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce.
As of April 27, local authorities had allocated 61 per cent of the funds earmarked for small businesses which were eligible, leaving almost 345,000 businesses waiting for the grant.
“Many of the companies that have been unable to use existing government support schemes are already on borrowed time — and will need these grants paid out swiftly if they are to survive,” said Mr Marshall.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Solar, wind energy struggle as coronavirus takes toll</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK (AP) — The US renewable energy industry is reeling from the new coronavirus pandemic, which has delayed construction, put thousands of skilled labourers out of work and sowed doubts about solar and wind projects on the drawing board.
In locked-down California, some local agencies that issue permits for new work closed temporarily, and some solar companies furloughed installers.
In New York and New Jersey, SunPower CEO Thomas Werner halted installation of more than 400 residential solar systems, fearing for his workers' safety.
As many as 120,000 jobs in solar and 35,000 in wind could be lost, trade groups say.
“There are many smaller companies going out of business as we speak,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “Up to half our jobs are at risk.”
Leaders are confident the future is bright. But the worldwide slowdown is delaying a transition to cleaner energy that scientists say is not happening quickly enough to curtail climate change.
Even as some states move toward reopening, executives fear diminished incomes and work disrupted by lay-offs and social distancing will do lasting damage.
The wind industry is plagued by slowdowns in obtaining parts from overseas, getting them to job sites and constructing new turbines.
“The industry was on a tremendous roll right up until the last month or two,” said Tom Kiernan, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association. “That reversal is stunning and problematic.”
Residential solar business has been hit especially hard, Hopper said, with door-to-door sales no longer feasible and potential customers watching their wallets. Deals with commercial buyers also have slumped.
New solar installations could be 17 per cent lower worldwide than expected this year, and wind turbine manufacturing could fall up to 20 per cent, according to consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.
“Pre-pandemic, there were great dreams and aspirations for a record-setting year,” said Paul Gaynor, CEO of Longroad Energy, a utility-scale wind and solar developer. “I'm sure we're not going to have that.”
Fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal remain the leading providers of the nation's electricity, with nuclear power another key contributor, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).
But renewable sources — wind, solar, hydroelectric, biomass and geothermal — have jumped in the last decade as production costs have fallen and many states have ordered utilities to make greater use of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Renewables produced nearly one-fifth of the country's energy last year.
The EIA predicts renewable energy, despite recent setbacks, will grow 11 per cent this year — an indication of the sector's strong surge before the economy tanked. Meanwhile, coal-fired power is expected to decline 20 per cent and gas generation to grow just one per cent.
The setback for renewable energy still has been painful — even in California, where residential solar demand took off due to frequent blackouts and state laws requiring to new homes to produce as much energy as they consume.
“A lot of companies are just trying everything they can to just limp along and keep their workforce,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association.
All 20 employees were temporarily furloughed at Cinnamon Energy Systems, which sells residential and commercial solar systems in Northern California.
“I'm sure we'll bounce back, just smaller,” CEO Barry Cinnamon said, adding that people might not spend as much as they once did, because their income will likely be down. “Whether that's months or years, nobody knows.”
Luminalt, a San Francisco solar company, furloughed most of its 40 employees. And when work resumes, CEO Jeanine Cotter expects that projects will take longer and cost more to keep installers safe.
“Think about working on a roof with a mask,” Cotter said. “And think about not being able to pass a power tool to somebody unless you disinfect it before you pass it on.”
Since his furlough in mid-March, Luminalt solar technician Tom Hicks has been collecting benefits but no salary — and he's worried about mortgage payments.
“My 401k got crushed by 30 per cent just like everyone else,” said Hicks, 55. “How much time do I have to recover?”
Still, there are hopeful signs. The Boston-based developer Longroad recently began a utility-scale solar project in California and secured new financing for another in Texas.
Sunnova Energy International, a Houston-based residential solar and energy storage service provider, is doing more videoconferencing and fewer in-person dealings with customers. But CEO John Berger said, “Our installations are still moving ahead, service is still moving ahead, we still see customers paying us.”
In eastern Kansas, construction has continued at Southern Power's 200-megawatt Reading Wind Facility despite delayed parts shipments, company spokeswoman Helen Northcutt White said. Sixty-two turbines are planned for the facility, scheduled to go online in mid-May.
The wind and solar industries have asked lawmakers and federal agencies for help, including an extension of their four-year deadlines for completing projects without losing tax benefits. Similar assistance was granted during the 2008-09 recession.
The renewable energy industry's health is crucial to improving the climate and to a strong economic recovery, said Matthew Davis, legislative director for the League of Conservation Voters.
“These businesses, these workers deserve immediate relief,” Davis said.
It's important to push for more responsible energy use as the economy reopens worldwide, said Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer with Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, Maine, which studies climate change and oceans.
“My hope is that we would use this as an opportunity to build toward an economy that doesn't depend on burning coal and oil and that is more resilient to the climate impacts that are heading our way,” Pershing said.

In locked-down California, some local agencies that issue permits for new work closed temporarily, and some solar companies furloughed installers.
In New York and New Jersey, SunPower CEO Thomas Werner halted installation of more than 400 residential solar systems, fearing for his workers’ safety.
As many as 120,000 jobs in solar and 35,000 in wind could be lost, trade groups say.
“There are many smaller companies going out of business as we speak,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “Up to half our jobs are at risk.”
Leaders are confident the future is bright. But the worldwide slowdown is delaying a transition to cleaner energy that scientists say is not happening quickly enough to curtail climate change.
Even as some states move toward reopening, executives fear diminished incomes and work disrupted by layoffs and social distancing will do lasting damage.
The wind industry is plagued by slowdowns in obtaining parts from overseas, getting them to job sites and constructing new turbines.
“The industry was on a tremendous roll right up until the last month or two,” said Tom Kiernan, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association. “That reversal is stunning and problematic.”
Residential solar business has been hit especially hard, Hopper said, with door-to-door sales no longer feasible and potential customers watching their wallets. Deals with commercial buyers also have slumped.
New solar installations could be 17% lower worldwide than expected this year, and wind turbine manufacturing could fall up to 20%, according to consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.
“Pre-pandemic, there were great dreams and aspirations for a record-setting year,” said Paul Gaynor, CEO of Longroad Energy, a utility-scale wind and solar developer. “I’m sure we’re not going to have that.”
Fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal remain the leading providers of the nation’s electricity, with nuclear power another key contributor, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
But renewable sources — wind, solar, hydroelectric, biomass and geothermal — have jumped in the last decade as production costs have fallen and many states have ordered utilities to make greater use of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Renewables produced nearly one-fifth of the country’s energy last year.
The EIA predicts renewable energy, despite recent setbacks, will grow 11% this year — an indication of the sector’s strong surge before the economy tanked. Meanwhile, coal-fired power is expected to decline 20% and gas generation to grow just 1%.
The setback for renewable energy still has been painful — even in California, where residential solar demand took off due to frequent blackouts and state laws requiring to new homes to produce as much energy as they consume.
“A lot of companies are just trying everything they can to just limp along and keep their workforce,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association.
All 20 employees were temporarily furloughed at Cinnamon Energy Systems, which sells residential and commercial solar systems in Northern California.
“I’m sure we’ll bounce back, just smaller,” CEO Barry Cinnamon said, adding that people might not spend as much as they once did, because their income will likely be down. “Whether that’s months or years, nobody knows.”
Luminalt, a San Francisco solar company, furloughed most of its 40 employees. And when work resumes, CEO Jeanine Cotter expects that projects will take longer and cost more to keep installers safe.
“Think about working on a roof with a mask,” Cotter said. “And think about not being able to pass a power tool to somebody unless you disinfect it before you pass it on.”
Since his furlough in mid-March, Luminalt solar technician Tom Hicks has been collecting benefits but no salary — and he’s worried about mortgage payments.
“My 401k got crushed by 30% just like everyone else,” said Hicks, 55. “How much time do I have to recover?”
Still, there are hopeful signs. The Boston-based developer Longroad recently began a utility-scale solar project in California and secured new financing for another in Texas.
Sunnova Energy International, a Houston-based residential solar and energy storage service provider, is doing more videoconferencing and fewer in-person dealings with customers. But CEO John Berger said, “Our installations are still moving ahead, service is still moving ahead, we still see customers paying us.”
In eastern Kansas, construction has continued at Southern Power’s 200-megawatt Reading Wind Facility despite delayed parts shipments, company spokeswoman Helen Northcutt White said. Sixty-two turbines are planned for the facility, scheduled to go online in mid-May.
The wind and solar industries have asked lawmakers and federal agencies for help, including an extension of their four-year deadlines for completing projects without losing tax benefits. Similar assistance was granted during the 2008-09 recession.
The renewable energy industry’s health is crucial to improving the climate and to a strong economic recovery, said Matthew Davis, legislative director for the League of Conservation Voters.
“These businesses, these workers deserve immediate relief,” Davis said.
It’s important to push for more responsible energy use as the economy reopens worldwide, said Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer with Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, Maine, which studies climate change and oceans.
“My hope is that we would use this as an opportunity to build toward an economy that doesn’t depend on burning coal and oil and that is more resilient to the climate impacts that are heading our way,” Pershing said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A time for 'Team Australia': ME Bank panned for blindsiding customers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Members Equity Bank has been accused of "pulling the rug" from underneath its customers in a time of national and personal crises, as more cases emerge of the boutique lender shifting personal funds without permission.
The Age and The Sydney Morning Heraldrevealed yesterday the bank, which is owned by 26 industry super funds and linked to big unions, had blindsided customers by removing access to money in redraw facilities and instead placing it to their loans.
This meant large portions of customers' over-and-above loan repayments, supposed to be available for them to withdraw "at any time, for free", according the marketing, had been shifted out of reach within the bank's books.
An irate small business owner contacted The Sunday Age and The Sun-Herald to say she had been using the draw down from her ME Bank home loan to pay her staff wages until Jobkeeper payments came through.
"I had $80,000 in my draw down and now there is zero," she said. "I am also still awaiting a call from their management so I can voice my complaint (and) absolute outrage."
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the banking and financial services royal commission reminded banks of the importance of complying with both the law and community expectations.
"Now more than ever is a time to put customers first," he said. "Every bank needs to play their part in Team Australia.”
Marcus Strom, who is the president of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance union, checked his own account after reading the article and discovered funds had been moved on Monday last week from "money available, to money not available in a loan."
Mr Strom, speaking in his personal capacity, said he had neither been given warning nor asked permission.
"I just thought it was a bit tricky," he said.
A letter received by customers on Friday, seen by The Sunday Age and The Sun-Herald, said the change was only to "the amount of funds available to redraw".
"The current design of the (redraw facility) allows people to 'over-dip' to a point where they could fall behind their original repayment schedule. When this happens a customer's repayments may increase in the future ... (and) this could create financial stress for some customers."
Mr Strom didn't believe the explanation was credible. "I'm not someone, I don't think, at risk of overdrawing," he said. "It looks like they've just done some accounting to me."
One customer reported $24,000 had been removed from her redraw facility and transferred to her loan. Another household, whose hours of work have been dramatically reduced in the coronavirus crisis, found $10,000 had been moved.
Liberal Senator Andrew Bragg, chair of Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology, said the coronavirus pandemic was a time for institutions to step up.
"I'm surprised that any institution would pull the rug from underneath a customer in this environment," he said. "Not just because of the pandemic, but because we've just had a banking royal commission."
The move by ME Bank to shift money away from customers prompted speculation that it wanted to shrink its loan book and reduce the risk of defaults.
ME Bank said the changes were designed to halt "over-dipping" and therefore reduce financial hardship down the road.
"No money has been removed from customer accounts. The adjustment made is to the amount available for redraw," a spokesman said.
"We understand that the change has caused concern to some customers, particularly in the current environment.
"We are reviewing the personal circumstances of each customer affected and are committed to working with them to determine how we can help with their individual financial needs."
Mr Bragg said Parliament, once it returned, needed to "push through all Ken Hayne's changes that he's recommended [from the royal commission]."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">American business tycoon Warren Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc has reported a net loss of nearly $50 billion in the first quarter amid the Covid-19 pandemic, while it also sold off all its airline stocks
Washington: American business tycoon Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc has reported a net loss of nearly $50 billion in the first quarter amid the Covid-19 pandemic, while it also sold off all its airline stocks.
The net loss totalled to $49.75 billion in the first quarter, or $30,653 dollars, per Class A share and $20.44 per Class B share, compared with a net earnings of $21.66 billion a year ago, Xinhua news agency quoted Berkshire as saying in a statement on Saturday.
The first-quarter operating earnings rose to $5.87 billion from $5.55 billion dollars, it added.
"As efforts to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated in the second half of March and continued through April, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe.
Berkshire has taken 'necessary' actions to mitigate the economic losses due to lower consumer demand for products and services," the statement said, adding that the company could not 'reliably predict' when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
At a virtual shareholder meeting also on Saturday, Buffett announced that his conglomerate has sold all its airline stocks, sending an alarming signal to industry devastated by the global pandemic.
"The world has changed for the airlines," he said. "And I don't know how it's changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way. It turned out I was wrong about that business,"
The Berkshire Hathaway previously held shares of United Airlines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Delta Airlines, worth over $4 billion last December, but stocks were down this year by 69.7 per cent, 62.9 per cent, 45.8 per cent, and 58.7 per cent, respectively, according to a report from CNBC. Berkshire, a US multinational conglomerate holding company, is based in Omaha, Nebraska.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire Hathaway lost $49.7 billion in first quarter stung by coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Not even Warren Buffett was spared financially from the coronavirus, as his conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, reported a $49.7 billion loss in the first quarter Saturday, reflecting the outbreak’s toll on an investment portfolio that includes big stakes in major airlines and financial firms.
The loss was Berkshire’s biggest ever and a sharp swing from a $21.7 billion profit in the same quarter a year earlier. The conglomerate’s vast array of investments exposed it — and Buffett, long considered one of the world’s top investors — to huge swaths of the battered US economy.
Its total investment loss for the quarter, without accounting for operating earnings, was $54.5 billion. By comparison, its investment gain in all of 2019 was $56.3 billion.
Berkshire said it continued to sell stock in April, totaling $6.5 billion, ploughing that money primarily into supersafe Treasury bills. Later Saturday, at his annual shareholders meeting, Buffett suggested that some of those sales involved Berkshire’s reversing its roughly 10% in the four largest US airlines.
Berkshire’s investment loss tracked the overall slide in stock markets: The S&P 500 dropped 20% in the first quarter. (The company’s biggest holdings are also mainstays of the S&P 500: American Express, Apple, Bank of America, Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo, with those stakes amounting to nearly $125 billion.)
The loss overshadowed a 6% rise in Berkshire’s operating earnings, which track the performance of the company’s owned-and-operated businesses like insurer Geico. Buffett regards that as a better measure of the company’s overall performance and has long argued that quarterly paper gains or losses on its investments “are often meaningless” in understanding its overall health.
But it is hard to ignore the damage to a portfolio that includes stakes in financial firms like Bank of America and American Express, both of which reported steep drops in earnings for the first quarter, and four of the biggest US airlines. (Berkshire also disclosed that the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz on its books exceeds the market value of that holding by about 40%, and warned that it might have to take a write-down on the investment in the future.)
Even some of the conglomerate’s wholly owned businesses, like the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and retailers like See’s Candy, were hurt by the lockdowns that have shaken the US economy. Still, Geico reported a 28% gain for the quarter, to $984 million, while Berkshire’s overall insurance investment profits rose modestly because of increased dividend income for the company.
The first-quarter results, in which Berkshire reported having $137.3 billion in cash, were released before its first online-only shareholder meeting. Sometimes described as a kind of Woodstock for capitalists, the meeting is usually a weekendlong Omaha, Nebraska, extravaganza celebrating all things Buffett and Berkshire.
This year, it was a decidedly more subdued affair, reflecting the limits on mass gatherings and travel of the COVID-crisis era. Buffett’s longtime business partner, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not attend, staying at home in Los Angeles.
“It just didn’t seem like a good idea to have him make the trip to Omaha,” Buffett said, adding, “Charlie is in fine shape, and he’ll be back next year.”
Buffett was joined instead by Greg Abel, Berkshire’s vice chairman overseeing all of the company’s non-insurance companies, who sat at a separate desk some distance from Buffett.
Instead of facing thousands of adoring and affluent shareholders, Buffett, noting that he hadn’t had a haircut in seven weeks, held forth in an almost completely vacant Omaha arena that seats more than 17,000, as his comments were livestreamed.
Discussing the breakdown in the financial markets that prompted the Federal Reserve to drastically ramp up efforts to pump in fresh cash, he said, “We came very close to having a total freeze of credit.”
When it came to Berkshire’s stake in the airlines, Buffett said, “I just decided that I’d made a mistake.”
He added that because of the pandemic’s impact on travel, “the airline business — and I may be wrong, and I hope I’m wrong — but I think it, it changed in a very major way.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">REUTERS: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway posted a higher operating profit on Saturday (May 2), but the coronavirus pandemic pummeled its common stock investments and led to a record net loss.
Berkshire's first-quarter net loss totalled US$49.75 billion, or US$30,653 per Class A share, reflecting US$54.52 billion of losses from investments, mainly common stocks. A year earlier, net earnings totalled US$21.66 billion, or US$13,209 per share.
Quarterly operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 6per cent to US$5.87 billion from US$5.56 billion.
An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealised stock losses and gains with earnings. This causes huge swings in Berkshire's net results that Buffett considers meaningless.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Says Lost $50 Bln in Q1 Due to COVID-19 Pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MOSCOW (Sputnik) - US business tycoon Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holding has reported a loss of $55 billion in Q1 amid COVID-19 pandemic, compared to $21 billion in profits over the same period last year, the company said in a press release on Saturday.
The published financial statements say the conglomerate lost $49.7 billion in the first quarter. The holding's revenue in 2019 amounted to $254.6 billion.
Meanwhile, the company's operating profits were 6 percent higher than those of 2019, amounting to $5.87 billion, or about $3,388 per share.
Berkshire owns railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, insurer Geico and chocolate maker See's Candies.
The businesses were rocked in mid-April due to numerous restrictive measures and lockdowns, which halted many industries across the world.
According to the Johns Hopkins University count, the new coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 3,402,400 people and has claimed the lives of at least 242,000 worldwide. In the United Kingdom, the COVID-19 tally has surpassed 183,400, with over 28,200 fatalities, the university says.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire Hathaway Lost $50 Billion Last Quarter As Warren Buffett’s Investments Took A Hit From Coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire Warren Buffett’s famed investing conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, reported a massive net loss of nearly $50 billion in the first quarter, as the coronavirus-driven market sell-off took a significant toll on the company's stock holdings.
Berkshire posted a record net loss of $49.75 billion in the first quarter—down from $21.7 billion in profit last year.
That amounts to a loss of $30,653 per share, compared to profits of $13,209 per share in the first quarter of 2019.
Even as the coronavirus hurt the company’s business, Berkshire’s operating profit rose 6% to $5.87 billion, up from $5.56 billion a year ago.
Berkshire’s quarterly filing makes 31 references to coronavirus, showing the pandemic’s substantial impact on the company so far in 2020.
The first quarter saw many of Buffett’s largest stock holdings—including big banks and airlines, plummet even further than the benchmark S&P 500, which fell 20% during that period.
Buffett’s cash pile is up from $125 billion to $137.3 billion, as the Oracle of Omaha continues to look for an elephant-sized acquisition.
Buffett emerged as a key player who helped restore confidence in the markets during the 2008 financial crisis, but he’s remained relatively quiet during the 2020 coronavirus downturn. Charlie Munger, vice chairman at Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B , told the Wall Street Journal recently that the Oracle of Omaha is being “fairly conservative” with his investments in the current market. He also admitted that a few of Berkshire’s smaller businesses might altogether. Companies are reportedly not calling Berkshire for capital like they were in 2008: “The phone is not ringing off the hook,” Munger confirmed, adding that airlines are “all negotiating with the government, but they’re not calling Warren.”
Berkshire Hathaway’s stock is down 20% so far this year, compared to a 13% decline for the S&P 500.
Warren Buffett is the world’s fourth-richest person, with a net worth of $72 billion, according to Forbes’ estimates.
Berkshire’s first-ever online annual shareholders meeting will take place later today, at 4:45 p.m. ET.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire Hathaway Q1 results: Buffett's company posts record net loss on coronavirus, operating profit rises</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday posted a record net loss of nearly $50 billion as the coronavirus pandemic pummeled its common stock investments, but operating profit rose even as COVID-19 hurt its businesses.
Berkshire's first-quarter net loss totaled $49.75 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, reflecting $54.52 billion of losses from investments, mainly common stocks. A year earlier, net earnings totaled $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per share.
Quarterly operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 6% to $5.87 billion, or about $3,624 per Class A share $5.56 billion, or about $3,388 per share.
An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized stock losses and gains with earnings. This causes huge swings in Berkshire's net results that Buffett considers meaningless.
Nonetheless, Berkshire has loaded up on stocks in part because of Buffett's inability to find large companies to buy outright, a drought that has lasted more than four years and left Berkshire with about $137.3 billion of cash.
The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 20% in the first quarter but there were steeper falls in several large Berkshire holdings including American Express, Bank of America , Wells Fargo and four airlines -- American , Delta, Southwest and United.
Berkshire's operating businesses, like much of corporate America, were not unscathed by COVID-19, which hurt volumes at the BNSF railroad and forced retail businesses such as See's Candies to temporarily close stores.
Most of Berkshire's businesses have been hurt by the pandemic, with effects so far ranging from "relatively minor to severe," and revenues of businesses deemed "essential" have slowed "considerably" in April, the company said.
Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told The Wall Street Journal last month that a few small Berkshire businesses might close altogether.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire Hathaway reports record quarterly loss thanks to pandemic, but Warren Buffett likely isn't too worried</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway took a hit during the coronavirus pandemic, reporting a record net loss of $49.75 billion in the first quarter. But CEO Warren Buffett likely isn't too concerned, CNBC reports.
That's because Buffett considers the company's operating profit, which actually rose 6 percent in the first quarter, to be a better performance measure. Berkshire's losses mainly reflect losses from investments in common stocks, which the company had loaded up on recently because Buffett hasn't been able to settle on any large companies to buy outright over the last four years. Some of those stocks include four major airlines — American, Delta, Southwest, and United — which have plummeted due to the decline in travel.
While the net loss was record-setting for Berkshire, Buffett is never immune to swings like this since an accounting rule requires the company to report unrealized stock losses and gains with earnings. That leads to booms and busts that the CEO considers meaningless, per CNBC.
Still, many of Berkshire's operating businesses were indeed hurt by the pandemic, and revenues deemed "essential" slowed "considerably" in April. Read more at CNBC.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett's firm reports nearly $50B loss as investments drop</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OMAHA, Neb. — Warren Buffett’s company reported a nearly $50 billion loss on Saturday because of a huge drop in the paper value of its investments, though the company is still sitting on a huge pile of cash.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said it lost $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, during the first quarter. That’s down from last year’s profit of $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per Class A share.
The biggest factor in the loss was a $54.5 billion loss on the value of Berkshire’s investment portfolio as the stock market declined sharply after the coronavirus outbreak began. The year before, Berkshire’s investments added $15.5 billion to the company’s profits.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - Warren Buffett’s company reported a nearly $50 billion loss on Saturday because of a huge drop in the paper value of its investments, though the company is still sitting on a huge pile of cash.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said it lost $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, during the first quarter. That’s down from last year’s profit of $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per Class A share.
The biggest factor in the loss was a $54.5 billion loss on the value of Berkshire’s investment portfolio as the stock market declined sharply after the coronavirus outbreak began. The year before, Berkshire’s investments added $15.5 billion to the company’s profits.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway slumps to $50bn loss in first quarter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway swung to a $49.7 billion (€44.8 billion) loss in the first three months of the year, as the sharp sell-off in global stock markets hammered its investment portfolio.
The sprawling industrial conglomerate disclosed on Saturday that its stock portfolio, which includes shares in blue-chip groups such as Apple and Bank of America, declined by $55.5 billion in value in the quarter alongside the 20 per cent drop in the S&P 500.
That decline more than offset the improvement in underlying earnings at Berkshire, which owns railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, insurer Geico and chocolate maker See’s Candies. Operating profits rose 5.7 per cent from a year earlier to $5.9 billion, as investment gains from its insurance business climbed.
“The amount of investment gains [AND]losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,” the company said in a statement.
Berkshire’s cash pile swelled to a record $137 billion and the group shifted a large portion of that into US Treasuries in the first quarter, a filing with US regulators showed.
Mr Buffett has for more than four years struggled to invest that cash in one of the major acquisitions for which the company is known. The so-called Oracle of Omaha has blamed high equity valuations in previous letters to investors as one of the main reasons the company has remained on the sidelines, as other large publicly traded groups went on acquisition sprees in recent years.
Shares of Berkshire have fallen 19 per cent this year to $273,975.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19 impact: Buffett’s Berkshire posts nearly $50b loss</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday posted a record net loss of nearly $50 billion as the coronavirus pandemic pummeled its common stock investments, but operating profit rose even as COVID-19 hurt its businesses.
Berkshire’s first-quarter net loss totaled $49.75 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, reflecting $54.52 billion of losses from investments, mainly common stocks. A year earlier, net earnings totaled $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per share.
Quarterly operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 6% to $5.87 billion, or about $3,624 per Class A share $5.56 billion, or about $3,388 per share.
An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized stock losses and gains with earnings. This causes huge swings in Berkshire’s net results that Buffett considers meaningless.
Nonetheless, Berkshire has loaded up on stocks in part because of Buffett’s inability to find large companies to buy outright, a drought that has lasted more than four years and left Berkshire with about $137.3 billion of cash.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 slid 20% in the first quarter but there were steeper falls in several large Berkshire holdings including American Express, Bank of America , Wells Fargo and four airlines -- American , Delta, Southwest and United.
Berkshire’s operating businesses, like much of corporate America, were not unscathed by COVID-19, which hurt volumes at the BNSF railroad and forced retail businesses such as See’s Candies to temporarily close stores.
Most of Berkshire’s businesses have been hurt by the pandemic, with effects so far ranging from “relatively minor to severe,” and revenues of businesses deemed “essential” have slowed “considerably” in April, the company said.
Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told The Wall Street Journal last month that a few small Berkshire businesses might close altogether.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Did Warren Buffett Buy Stocks in the Coronavirus Crash? The Answer Might Surprise You</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) just released its first-quarter earnings report, and most of the numbers weren't too surprising. Its operating businesses performed rather well, while its stock portfolio declined in value along with the rest of the market. 
However, many investors had been waiting to see if Berkshire was able to deploy some of its massive $128 billion cash stockpile during the COVID-19 market crash. While we don't know exactly what stocks Warren Buffett and his team might have bought and sold, we just learned how much cash Berkshire has, as well as how much it may have spent on stocks during the first quarter.
Berkshire Hathaway reported a pretty large net loss for the first quarter: $49.7 billion, which translates to $20.44 per share.
Here's why investors shouldn't care about this "loss." We all know that Berkshire has a massive stock portfolio -- worth nearly $200 billion considering positions we currently know about. Well, due to accounting rules, Berkshire's unrealized stock gains and losses are included in its quarterly earnings. And we all know what happened in the stock market in March. Berkshire's $49.7 billion loss included $70.3 billion in investment "losses," but this just reflects the market value of the stock portfolio as of March 31, when the market was near its lows.
In contrast to what the stock portfolio might indicate, Berkshire's operating businesses are doing quite well. Just to run down a few key numbers:
Any shareholders who were expecting Buffett and his team to go on a stock-buying spree in the first quarter are likely to be disappointed.
Berkshire ended 2019 with about $128 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet, a figure that's grown significantly in recent years as the company has struggled to find attractive opportunities. So, when the stock market started to plunge in March, investors were hopeful that Berkshire might finally start to put significant amounts of its capital to work.
Well, you might be in for a surprise. Berkshire had more than $137 billion in cash, equivalents, and Treasury securities on its balance sheet at the end of the first quarter. To be fair, Berkshire does generate billions per quarter from its operating businesses, and the company has an $8.6 billion liability listed on its balance sheet for Treasury securities it recently purchased (which are included in the $137 billion figure). So, it's likely Berkshire was a net buyer of stocks -- just not nearly to the extent investors had hoped.
Another clue is the cost basis of the stocks Berkshire currently owned -- in other words, what Berkshire paid for the stocks currently in its portfolio. At the end of 2019, the cost basis of Berkshire's equity securities was $110.3 billion. As of March 31, it had increased to $113.2 billion. Obviously, there's a lot this doesn't tell us, such as how much stock Berkshire sold during the period, but it does indicate that Berkshire put a few billion to work in the market by the end of March.
Berkshire's buyback program allows the company to repurchase as many shares as it wants, as long as two conditions are met:
Obviously, the first condition isn't a problem. So, the main question is whether the pair thought the stock was a good value in the first quarter.
In all, Berkshire spent about $1.7 billion in buybacks in the first quarter. This is a fairly large total compared with recent quarters, but there are two big caveats. While this may sound like a lot of buyback activity, it represents less than 0.4% of Berkshire's market cap. And the buybacks took place before the bulk of the market crash occurred, which is a bit of a disappointment.
Even so, this shows that Buffett and Munger thought shares were trading at enough of a discount to intrinsic value in these three time windows to pull the trigger on some repurchases.
On one hand, many investors were hoping Buffett and his stock-picking team would do far more stock buying in the coronavirus market crash than they actually did. And, many were hoping Berkshire had spent billions on buybacks when the stock reached its lowest price-to-book valuation in recent history (Berkshire's share price actually dipped below book value in late March). We now know that these things didn't happen.
With that in mind, there are some positives to keep in mind.
First, a 6% increase in operating profit is an encouraging sign.
Second, it's important to emphasize that this only covers through March 31. Stocks were still fairly cheap (in a recent historical context) in April -- and still are -- so it's entirely possible Berkshire did some buying after the quarter ended.
Finally, while Buffett and his team are known for making savvy investments during tough times, they typically aren't in a rush to put their capital to work at the beginning of a crash. For example, Berkshire's highly profitable Bank of America investment was actually made in 2011, a couple years after the financial crisis ended.
In a nutshell, the best way to label Berkshire's first-quarter earnings report is "a mixed bag." We'll get a little more color on Berkshire's investment strategy and general outlook during its annual meeting, and then later in May when its 13-F filing reveals its latest stock market activity, so stay tuned.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stock market slide pushes Berkshire Hathaway to $50bn loss</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway recorded a $49.7bn loss in the first three months of the year, as the sharp sell-off in global stock markets hammered its investment portfolio.
The sprawling conglomerate disclosed on Saturday that the decline in value of its stock and derivative portfolio, which includes shares in blue-chip groups such as Apple and Bank of America, generated a $55.6bn loss in the quarter. Multibillion-dollar mark-to-market losses in the quarter accompanied a 20 per cent drop in the S&P 500.
That decline more than offset the improvement in underlying earnings at Berkshire, which owns railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, insurer Geico and chocolate maker See’s Candies. Operating profits rose 5.7 per cent from a year earlier to $5.9bn, as investment gains from its insurance business climbed.
“The amount of investment gains [and] losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,” the company said in a statement.
Berkshire’s cash pile swelled to a record $137bn and the group shifted a large portion of that into US Treasuries in the first quarter, a filing with US regulators showed.
Mr Buffett has for more than four years struggled to invest that cash in one of the major acquisitions for which the company is known. The so-called Oracle of Omaha has blamed high equity valuations in previous letters to investors as one of the main reasons the company has remained on the sidelines, as other large publicly traded groups went on acquisition sprees in recent years.
Berkshire instead purchased $1.7bn of its own common stock during the quarter, with much of that buying occurring in late-February and early-March as the price of its own shares were sliding alongside the broader market. But those purchases did not continue into the start of April, according to James Shanahan, an analyst who follows Berkshire at Edward Jones.
“If Buffett is not seeing opportunities in his own stock should we conclude the recent market sell-off isn’t a buying opportunity,” Mr Shanahan asked. “I don’t know what if anything is more important to ask Buffett today.”
The quarterly disclosure on Berkshire’s many subsidiaries showed only the early impact from the coronavirus outbreak, which is known to have killed more than 200,000 people and has sparked a severe economic downturn.
“As efforts to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated in the second half of March and continued through April, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe,” Berkshire said.

The group’s BNSF railroad reported a 6 per cent decline in revenues in the period, led by a drop-off in shipments of consumer products. Sales at aerospace-parts manufacturer Precision Castparts slid as Boeing suspended the manufacturing of its 737-Max jet and shipments to covid-affected businesses declined. NetJets suffered from lower demand while Clayton Homes, which makes and sells mobile homes, increased its provisions for loan losses related to the virus.
Insurer Geico was one of the bright spots for the company, as shelter-in-place guidelines across the US led to a drop in auto-related claims.
Berkshire said it was taking measures to cut costs and that some of its business lines had furloughed employees and reduced staff salaries. Shares of Berkshire have fallen 19 per cent this year to $273,975.
Investors will get a fuller update from Mr Buffett later on Saturday through a live video-cast. The company, which remains among the most highly valued publicly traded groups in the world, cancelled the festivities that normally surround its annual meeting due to the health crisis.
The tens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders who traditionally descend on downtown Omaha for the company’s annual meeting will instead hear his missives and those from Berkshire vice-chairman Greg Abel this year from their own homes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold more than $6 billion in stock in April, its first-quarter earnings show</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold more than $US6 billion worth of stocks in April,according to first-quarter earnings released on Saturday ahead of its annual meeting.
The famed investor’s conglomerate holds stakes in Apple, Amazon, Coca-Cola, and other companies. It was widely expected to capitalise on the coronavirus sell-off and buy stocks on the cheap, but instead netted about $US6.1 billion from stock sales last month.
Berkshire’s cash pile swelled from $US128 billion on December 31 to $US137 billion at the end of March, despite it spending $US1.7 billion on share buybacks in the period.
The group’s first-quarter figures fell short of the consensus estimates of Wall Street analysts polled by Bloomberg.

Here are the key numbers:
Berkshire posted a net loss of $US49.7 billion last quarter, a sharp swing from its net earnings of $US21.6 billion in the first quarter of 2019. The shift reflected $US54.5 billion in investment losses, compared to a $US15.5 billion gain in the same period last year.
However, Berkshire warned investors against reading too much into its earnings.
“The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,” the company said in its earnings release.
Berkshire’s operating earnings grew 6% to $US5.9 billion as insurance investment income and “other” earnings rose, offsetting lower insurance underwriting profits due to expected pandemic payouts and less income from its railroad, utilities and energy segment.
The conglomerate had $US113 billion invested in equity securities at the end of March, a slight increase from $US110 billion at the end of December. It raked in $US965 million in after-tax gains from sales of investments last quarter, a sharp increase from $US392 million in the comparable period.

Like many other companies, Berkshire warned that the coronavirus outbreak has “negatively affected” most of its businesses, with the effects ranging from “relatively minor to severe.”
Several of its businesses including railroads, utilities, and insurance have been deemed essential and allowed to continue operating, but their revenues “slowed considerably” in April. Other Berkshire companies including retailers, and some manufacturing and service businesses are being “severely impacted” by closures.
Berkshire added that the fallout will likely continue in the current quarter.
“The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March and will likely adversely affect nearly all of our operations in the second quarter, although such effects may vary significantly,” the company said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold more than $6 billion in stock in April, its first-quarter earnings show</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold more than $6 billion worth of stocks in April, according to first-quarter earnings released on Saturday ahead of its annual meeting.
The famed investor's conglomerate holds stakes in Apple, Amazon, Coca-Cola, and other companies. It was widely expected to capitalize on the coronavirus sell-off and buy stocks on the cheap, but instead netted about $6.1 billion from stock sales last month.
Berkshire's cash pile swelled from $128 billion on December 31 to $137 billion at the end of March, despite $1.8 billion in net stock purchases and $1.7 billion in share buybacks in the period.
The group's first-quarter figures fell short of the consensus estimates of Wall Street analysts polled by Bloomberg.

Here are the key numbers:
Berkshire posted a net loss of $49.7 billion last quarter, its biggest-ever quarterly loss and a sharp swing from its net earnings of $21.6 billion in the first quarter of 2019. The shift reflected $54.5 billion in investment losses, compared to a $15.5 billion gain in the same period last year.
However, Berkshire warned investors against reading too much into its earnings.
"The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules," the company said in its earnings release.
Berkshire's operating earnings grew 6% to $5.9 billion as insurance investment income and "other" earnings rose, offsetting lower insurance underwriting profits due to expected pandemic payouts and less income from its railroad, utilities and energy segment.
The conglomerate had $113 billion invested in equity securities at the end of March, a slight increase from $110 billion at the end of December. It raked in $965 million in after-tax gains from sales of investments last quarter, a sharp increase from $392 million in the comparable period.

With original programming and user-generated content that reaches more than two billion people each month, YouTube rivals streaming giants including Netflix and Amazon.
It pulled in $15 billion in advertising revenue in 2019, more than TV networks ABC, NBC, and Fox combined. Another $3 billion came from non-ad revenue in products like YouTube Music and YouTube TV, though YouTube pays a portion of that money back to networks and publishers in distribution rights.

The platform has turned content creators, from MrBeast to Emma Chamberlain, into stars with multi-platform businesses and major brand partnerships. With the help of partner managers, top YouTube creators are establishing new business models for Hollywood.
YouTube has also drawn regulators' antitrust and privacy questions. In September, YouTube got hit with a $170 million fee for reportedly violating the Child Online Privacy Protection Act. The company has struggled to keep out extremist content and ads that break its rules against misinformation.
Business Insider identified the top people behind YouTube's growing ad business.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The novel coronavirus has put a lot of stress on state economies.
Because of stay-at-home orders and temporary closures of nonessential businesses, many workers have been laid off or furloughed and demand in some industries has declined, such as in travel and hospitality.
The response to the coronavirus has already put a strain on state budgets as states have to find money to cover the unprecedented number of people filing for unemployment benefits after major layoffs across industries. Sales and income taxes, which make up a large percentage of a state’s tax revenue, are also affected by more people facing layoffs, staying at home, and spending less.
According to the Brookings Institution, states also have to spend more to meet the demand for Medicaid and other healthcare spending during the pandemic, and some states have enacted or have pending money transfers from their general funds to help with different needs in their state.
“When expenses go up, policymakers have to either cut spending or find revenue from raising taxes or withdrawing from their rainy day funds,” Justin Theal, research officer at Pew Charitable Trusts, told Business Insider. “That’s why having robust savings is so important….Whether a state cuts spending or increases taxes to balance their budget – that ultimately takes money out of the economy and makes it harder for a nation as a whole to recover.”
During the last recession, Theal said states had to make cuts to their budgets in areas like higher education, infrastructure, or state aid to local governments. Some states have caught up in these areas since the recession, but others have not.
“The areas of the budget that the policy makers would typically look to cut, to help balance their budgets during economic downturns, like higher education, in many states there’s not that much flexibility in that area because they hadn’t caught up on the cuts that they had made during the Great Recession,” Theal said.
States can also get aid from federal funding to help budget shortfalls and expenses.
The recent CARES Act has provided some economic relief to help states, businesses, and individuals around the country during the pandemic, but some economists believe that state and local governments will still fall short in their budgets, even with up to $150 billion relief from the CARES Act.
The latest approved federal aid will provide more assistance to small businesses but not state and local governments who need it to cover budget shortfalls. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently said he would rather have states go bankrupt than give them federal funding.
According to a recent blog post from the Economic Policy Institute, based on already existing predicted budget shortfalls and recent data projections, state and local governments will need another stimulus package of $500 billion.
Amid closures, layoffs, and the need for more federal aid, one positive is that many states have money reserved in rainy day funds, or budget stabilization accounts, to help with economic downfalls. Rainy day funds help states cover budget shortfalls, as most states must balance their budgets each year, so that they can reduce the need for budget cuts or tax increases, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.
Rainy day funds are so important because they could be used to help shortfalls during and after the coronavirus. According to the Associated Press, financial experts said without this financial “cushion” states would have been “in much worse shape” for handling the economic impacts from the pandemic.
“The present crisis should just be another reminder of how important it is to fund these reserve accounts when times are good so that they can help states in difficult times in the future,” Janelle Cammenga, policy analyst at Tax Foundation, told Business Insider.
Although the current situation is an example of the perfect time to dip into reserves, rainy day funds are not unlimited. If a state uses all their money in this account “then they just can’t take anymore money out of it and they have to find another way to balance their budget,” Cammenga said.
The total in rainy day funds across all 50 states was $74.9 billion for fiscal year 2019, using figures from Pew Charitable Trusts. The median number of days a state could run on rainy day funds was 27.9 days, which was 10.6 more days than the median during the Great Recession, according to Pew.
However, the current conditions of those funds vary widely from state to state.
According to Pew Charitable Trusts, 34 states have built up their rainy day funds to be better equipped for economic crises than they were going into the last recession. Four states – New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Illinois – have less than a week’s worth of rainy day funds. Kansas cannot operate at all on just rainy day funds because although it opened up its rainy day fund in 2016, the state hasn’t put any money in the account yet. It was planning to start adding money in its account in fiscal year 2020, according to Tax Foundation.
It is important to note that 12 states have limits on how much can be withdrawn in a year. For instance, North Carolina can only take out 7.5% of last year’s general fund, which works out to around $1.25 billion, and Idaho can use 50% of its rainy day balance in a year, or about $373 million.
Every state has legal limitations on how they can spend rainy day funds, except for six states that can use the money for any reason.
There are also differences in who authorizes the withdrawals. The Tax Foundation wrote in a recent report on rainy day funds that it might be easier to use rainy day funds in states that require approval from executive agencies or governors than in those who need approval from legislators. This is because stay-at-home orders and other responses amid the pandemic might make it harder for legislators to come together.
The Tax Foundation compiled a full list of how much of a rainy day fund a state can use, what purposes those funds can be used for, and who authorizes it. Some state governors have already planned on using money from their reserves amid the coronavirus, such as in Washington and Maryland.
Theal said when looking at the rainy day funds, it is important to look at a state’s sources of revenue and the diversity of its economy. According to an article from Vox, 70% of state tax revenue is from sales and income taxes, which have been collapsing as businesses shutter and workers are laid off or furloughed.
Theal said because tax day was delayed this year to July 15, after most states’ budget years finish at the end of June, “you’re shifting this huge influx of personal income tax collections from the current fiscal year to the next one” which will create more stress on balancing budgets.
“The pandemic and its fiscal impacts will linger for months if not years within states,” Theal said. “And so a lot of states are convening emergency sessions to bring the legislators back and have to adjust their 2021 budgets based on the new forecast of how revenue will be impacted and the additional strains on spending and what they ultimately mean to each state’s budget.”
To get a sense of where states and their rainy day funds stand, we looked at Pew’s estimates for how many days they could pay their bills using those funds alone. The following six states represent examples of where places with different financial situations and impact from the coronavirus all sit today.
New Jersey has been hit especially hard by the coronavirus, and its finances were already in dire condition before the crisis.
New Jersey used up all of its funds during the last recession and had a hard time rebuilding this reserve, according to NJ Spotlight.
According to Pew Trusts, New Jersey had 3.9 days to operate alone on its rainy day funds in fiscal year 2019. The state had $401 million, or 1.1% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
Although the amount is small compared to other states, it is significant because 2019 was the first time in over a decade that money was added to the emergency fund account, according to Politico.
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities using Moody’s analytics on budget stress tests, New Jersey is one of the states “least prepared” for an economic downturn.
“While their economies are not so volatile, they have exceptionally small reserves, partly because they failed for many years to adequately fund their public employee pension systems and now are struggling to restore those systems’ long-term health,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote.
New York is the epicenter of the coronavirus in the US, with over 156,000 cases in New York City alone, as of April 27, and its major sources of revenue have taken a hit as the tourism industry and businesses temporarily close.
According to data from Pew Trusts, New York had 10.3 days to operate just on its rainy day funds in fiscal year 2019. The state had $2 billion, or 2.8% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
The state already had a budget gap of $6 billion before the pandemic. One reason for this was due to Medicaid costs and demand. Six million New Yorkers are enrolled in the program and spending for this healthcare program was about $75 billion in fiscal year 2018 in New York, according to The New York Times.
In 2012, “the state froze Medicaid contributions paid by county governments” to help local New York governments, meaning the state then had to help with any Medicaid cost increases, according to Syracuse News. To help with the high costs of the healthcare program and to address the budget gap, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York recently proposed that counties control increases in the cost of Medicaid locally to no more than 3%, according to The New York Times article.
Theal said with unemployment numbers rising, more people will be looking to “draw upon Medicaid health benefits.” The state’s unemployment rate in March 2020 was at 4.5%, which is most likely lower than the actual rate as this is a preliminary reported figure from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics that does not include the subsequent weeks of layoffs and furloughs.
In contrast to New Jersey and New York, Wyoming is better prepared for an economic emergency.
According to figures from Pew, Wyoming can operate for over a year on just their rainy day funds, with 397.7 days worth of funding.
One reason their rainy day fund account of $1.7 billion, or 109.0% of its annual spending, was so high is because the state does a good job of saving money when times are good since its main revenue source of oil and fossil fuels fluctuates, Theal said.
Although Wyoming has a robust rainy day fund, it is one of the states that requires repayment quickly and has to repay the full amount the following fiscal year, according to Tax Foundation.
“I think that when given the choice between cutting more costs and dipping into rainy day funds, I think a lot of states are going to end up relying on their rainy day funds for some relief there,” Cammenga said. “But I think it will be largely the states that don’t have those really stringent requirements.”
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities using Moody’s analytics on budget stress tests, Wyoming is “best prepared” for an economic downturn.
However, its reliance on one source of revenue could be an issue, especially during recent declines in oil prices.
According to Rob Godby, an economist at the University of Wyoming, interviewed by Sierra Magazine, he said “Wyoming has to make fundamental changes to move beyond its dependence on falling energy revenues. That could mean hiking property or other taxes or introducing an income tax.”
Nevada has a large tourism industry that has been impacted by the state lockdown and is projected to have the most job losses by this summer among states and DC.
According to Pew Trusts, Nevada can run for 27.3 days on just its rainy day fund, which is close to the median across the states in fiscal year 2019. The state had $332 million, or 7.5% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
The amount in its account has gone up and down over the years, including during and after the Great Recession.
The state had $268 million in fiscal year 2007, which decreased to $72.6 million in fiscal year 2008. In fiscal year 2009, the state only had $600,000, enough for less than a day.
According to a Brookings Institution report in 2017, “Nevada policymakers, assuming that the gaming and tourism industry was less vulnerable to swings in the business cycle, did not build up reserves during the early 2000s when revenue was soaring.” As a result, Nevada’s revenue was negatively affected by the Great Recession as its main sources of revenue fell.
But dipping into its reserves, “did not offset the deep spending cuts, tax increases, borrowing, and one-time federal stimulus money,” according to Brookings.
Although Michigan has enough in its rainy day funds to run for over a month, it might not be prepared for serve economic impacts from the pandemic.
According to Pew, Michigan has enough money in its rainy day account to operate for 40.2 days based on its $1.1 billion in reserves, or 11.0% of its spending. Their budget stabilization fund has been rising since fiscal year 2014.
However, these reserves might not be enough to cover expenses and shortfalls during and after the coronavirus.
According to a report by, Citizen’s Research Council of Michigan in 2017, Michigan is only prepared for a “mild economic downturn.”
The state holds a better financial cushion than it did during the Great Recession, when the state had no money saved in its rainy day funds after using them to cover budget shortfalls from Michigan’s “single-state recession”, a term used in Michigan after the state spent almost a decade in a recession even after other states started to recover from a national recession in 2001, according to Citizen’s Research Council of Michigan.
Pew notes that Michigan is one of the states that spends “considerable amounts” outside of their rainy day funds that also might add to aid the state in economic downfalls.
Although California has been building up its rainy day funds since it depleted its account in the Great Recession, the state is already predicting budget shortfalls.
According to Pew, California can run on rainy day funds for 52.8 days, more than double the median among states and among the top 10 states with the highest number of operating days.
Since 2014, the state requires 1.5% of its General Fund be put into its rainy day funds, according to California Legislative Analyst Office. The state had $20.6 billion in fiscal year 2019, or 14.5% of its spending, in its budget stabilization account.
But because of the nation’s response to the pandemic, such as businesses temporarily closing and layoffs, that can affect the state’s major sources of revenue. Experts covered by the LA Times believe their rainy day funds could be depleted to cover the state’s economic shortfalls.
The state heavily relies on personal income taxes for revenue, where 67% of the proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 comes from personal income taxes, according to The Sacramento Bee. A good portion of income taxes comes from upper-income Californians, which The Sacramento Bee points out their source of income can vary. This makes it an unreliable source of revenue.

But because of the nation's response to the pandemic, such as businesses temporarily closing and layoffs, that can affect the state's major sources of revenue. Experts covered by the LA Times believe their rainy day funds could be depleted to cover the state's economic shortfalls.
The state heavily relies on personal income taxes for revenue, where 67% of the proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 comes from personal income taxes, according to The Sacramento Bee. A good portion of income taxes comes from upper-income Californians, which The Sacramento Bee points out their source of income can vary. This makes it an unreliable source of revenue.

    <h5 class="mb-1">We surveyed the ‘rainy day’ funds of 6 states to see how prepared they were for a major emergency. The results paint a grim picture for the country’s economic recovery.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The novel coronavirus has put a lot of stress on state economies.
Because of stay-at-home orders and temporary closures of nonessential businesses, many workers have been laid off or furloughed and demand in some industries has declined, such as in travel and hospitality.
The response to the coronavirus has already put a strain on state budgets as states have to find money to cover the unprecedented number of people filing for unemployment benefits after major layoffs across industries. Sales and income taxes, which make up a large percentage of a state’s tax revenue, are also affected by more people facing layoffs, staying at home, and spending less.
According to the Brookings Institution, states also have to spend more to meet the demand for Medicaid and other healthcare spending during the pandemic, and some states have enacted or have pending money transfers from their general funds to help with different needs in their state.
“When expenses go up, policymakers have to either cut spending or find revenue from raising taxes or withdrawing from their rainy day funds,” Justin Theal, research officer at Pew Charitable Trusts, told Business Insider. “That’s why having robust savings is so important….Whether a state cuts spending or increases taxes to balance their budget – that ultimately takes money out of the economy and makes it harder for a nation as a whole to recover.”
During the last recession, Theal said states had to make cuts to their budgets in areas like higher education, infrastructure, or state aid to local governments. Some states have caught up in these areas since the recession, but others have not.
“The areas of the budget that the policy makers would typically look to cut, to help balance their budgets during economic downturns, like higher education, in many states there’s not that much flexibility in that area because they hadn’t caught up on the cuts that they had made during the Great Recession,” Theal said.
States can also get aid from federal funding to help budget shortfalls and expenses.
The recent CARES Act has provided some economic relief to help states, businesses, and individuals around the country during the pandemic, but some economists believe that state and local governments will still fall short in their budgets, even with up to $150 billion relief from the CARES Act.
The latest approved federal aid will provide more assistance to small businesses but not state and local governments who need it to cover budget shortfalls. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently said he would rather have states go bankrupt than give them federal funding.
According to a recent blog post from the Economic Policy Institute, based on already existing predicted budget shortfalls and recent data projections, state and local governments will need another stimulus package of $500 billion.
Amid closures, layoffs, and the need for more federal aid, one positive is that many states have money reserved in rainy day funds, or budget stabilization accounts, to help with economic downfalls. Rainy day funds help states cover budget shortfalls, as most states must balance their budgets each year, so that they can reduce the need for budget cuts or tax increases, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.
Rainy day funds are so important because they could be used to help shortfalls during and after the coronavirus. According to the Associated Press, financial experts said without this financial “cushion” states would have been “in much worse shape” for handling the economic impacts from the pandemic.
“The present crisis should just be another reminder of how important it is to fund these reserve accounts when times are good so that they can help states in difficult times in the future,” Janelle Cammenga, policy analyst at Tax Foundation, told Business Insider.
Although the current situation is an example of the perfect time to dip into reserves, rainy day funds are not unlimited. If a state uses all their money in this account “then they just can’t take anymore money out of it and they have to find another way to balance their budget,” Cammenga said.
The total in rainy day funds across all 50 states was $74.9 billion for fiscal year 2019, using figures from Pew Charitable Trusts. The median number of days a state could run on rainy day funds was 27.9 days, which was 10.6 more days than the median during the Great Recession, according to Pew.
However, the current conditions of those funds vary widely from state to state.
According to Pew Charitable Trusts, 34 states have built up their rainy day funds to be better equipped for economic crises than they were going into the last recession. Four states – New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Illinois – have less than a week’s worth of rainy day funds. Kansas cannot operate at all on just rainy day funds because although it opened up its rainy day fund in 2016, the state hasn’t put any money in the account yet. It was planning to start adding money in its account in fiscal year 2020, according to Tax Foundation.
It is important to note that 12 states have limits on how much can be withdrawn in a year. For instance, North Carolina can only take out 7.5% of last year’s general fund, which works out to around $1.25 billion, and Idaho can use 50% of its rainy day balance in a year, or about $373 million.
Every state has legal limitations on how they can spend rainy day funds, except for six states that can use the money for any reason.
There are also differences in who authorizes the withdrawals. The Tax Foundation wrote in a recent report on rainy day funds that it might be easier to use rainy day funds in states that require approval from executive agencies or governors than in those who need approval from legislators. This is because stay-at-home orders and other responses amid the pandemic might make it harder for legislators to come together.
The Tax Foundation compiled a full list of how much of a rainy day fund a state can use, what purposes those funds can be used for, and who authorizes it. Some state governors have already planned on using money from their reserves amid the coronavirus, such as in Washington and Maryland.
Theal said when looking at the rainy day funds, it is important to look at a state’s sources of revenue and the diversity of its economy. According to an article from Vox, 70% of state tax revenue is from sales and income taxes, which have been collapsing as businesses shutter and workers are laid off or furloughed.
Theal said because tax day was delayed this year to July 15, after most states’ budget years finish at the end of June, “you’re shifting this huge influx of personal income tax collections from the current fiscal year to the next one” which will create more stress on balancing budgets.
“The pandemic and its fiscal impacts will linger for months if not years within states,” Theal said. “And so a lot of states are convening emergency sessions to bring the legislators back and have to adjust their 2021 budgets based on the new forecast of how revenue will be impacted and the additional strains on spending and what they ultimately mean to each state’s budget.”
To get a sense of where states and their rainy day funds stand, we looked at Pew’s estimates for how many days they could pay their bills using those funds alone. The following six states represent examples of where places with different financial situations and impact from the coronavirus all sit today.
New Jersey has been hit especially hard by the coronavirus, and its finances were already in dire condition before the crisis.
New Jersey used up all of its funds during the last recession and had a hard time rebuilding this reserve, according to NJ Spotlight.
According to Pew Trusts, New Jersey had 3.9 days to operate alone on its rainy day funds in fiscal year 2019. The state had $401 million, or 1.1% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
Although the amount is small compared to other states, it is significant because 2019 was the first time in over a decade that money was added to the emergency fund account, according to Politico.
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities using Moody’s analytics on budget stress tests, New Jersey is one of the states “least prepared” for an economic downturn.
“While their economies are not so volatile, they have exceptionally small reserves, partly because they failed for many years to adequately fund their public employee pension systems and now are struggling to restore those systems’ long-term health,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote.
New York is the epicenter of the coronavirus in the US, with over 156,000 cases in New York City alone, as of April 27, and its major sources of revenue have taken a hit as the tourism industry and businesses temporarily close.
According to data from Pew Trusts, New York had 10.3 days to operate just on its rainy day funds in fiscal year 2019. The state had $2 billion, or 2.8% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
The state already had a budget gap of $6 billion before the pandemic. One reason for this was due to Medicaid costs and demand. Six million New Yorkers are enrolled in the program and spending for this healthcare program was about $75 billion in fiscal year 2018 in New York, according to The New York Times.
In 2012, “the state froze Medicaid contributions paid by county governments” to help local New York governments, meaning the state then had to help with any Medicaid cost increases, according to Syracuse News. To help with the high costs of the healthcare program and to address the budget gap, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York recently proposed that counties control increases in the cost of Medicaid locally to no more than 3%, according to The New York Times article.
Theal said with unemployment numbers rising, more people will be looking to “draw upon Medicaid health benefits.” The state’s unemployment rate in March 2020 was at 4.5%, which is most likely lower than the actual rate as this is a preliminary reported figure from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics that does not include the subsequent weeks of layoffs and furloughs.
In contrast to New Jersey and New York, Wyoming is better prepared for an economic emergency.
According to figures from Pew, Wyoming can operate for over a year on just their rainy day funds, with 397.7 days worth of funding.
One reason their rainy day fund account of $1.7 billion, or 109.0% of its annual spending, was so high is because the state does a good job of saving money when times are good since its main revenue source of oil and fossil fuels fluctuates, Theal said.
Although Wyoming has a robust rainy day fund, it is one of the states that requires repayment quickly and has to repay the full amount the following fiscal year, according to Tax Foundation.
“I think that when given the choice between cutting more costs and dipping into rainy day funds, I think a lot of states are going to end up relying on their rainy day funds for some relief there,” Cammenga said. “But I think it will be largely the states that don’t have those really stringent requirements.”
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities using Moody’s analytics on budget stress tests, Wyoming is “best prepared” for an economic downturn.
However, its reliance on one source of revenue could be an issue, especially during recent declines in oil prices.
According to Rob Godby, an economist at the University of Wyoming, interviewed by Sierra Magazine, he said “Wyoming has to make fundamental changes to move beyond its dependence on falling energy revenues. That could mean hiking property or other taxes or introducing an income tax.”
Nevada has a large tourism industry that has been impacted by the state lockdown and is projected to have the most job losses by this summer among states and DC.
According to Pew Trusts, Nevada can run for 27.3 days on just its rainy day fund, which is close to the median across the states in fiscal year 2019. The state had $332 million, or 7.5% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
The amount in its account has gone up and down over the years, including during and after the Great Recession.
The state had $268 million in fiscal year 2007, which decreased to $72.6 million in fiscal year 2008. In fiscal year 2009, the state only had $600,000, enough for less than a day.
According to a Brookings Institution report in 2017, “Nevada policymakers, assuming that the gaming and tourism industry was less vulnerable to swings in the business cycle, did not build up reserves during the early 2000s when revenue was soaring.” As a result, Nevada’s revenue was negatively affected by the Great Recession as its main sources of revenue fell.
But dipping into its reserves, “did not offset the deep spending cuts, tax increases, borrowing, and one-time federal stimulus money,” according to Brookings.
Although Michigan has enough in its rainy day funds to run for over a month, it might not be prepared for serve economic impacts from the pandemic.
According to Pew, Michigan has enough money in its rainy day account to operate for 40.2 days based on its $1.1 billion in reserves, or 11.0% of its spending. Their budget stabilization fund has been rising since fiscal year 2014.
However, these reserves might not be enough to cover expenses and shortfalls during and after the coronavirus.
According to a report by, Citizen’s Research Council of Michigan in 2017, Michigan is only prepared for a “mild economic downturn.”
The state holds a better financial cushion than it did during the Great Recession, when the state had no money saved in its rainy day funds after using them to cover budget shortfalls from Michigan’s “single-state recession”, a term used in Michigan after the state spent almost a decade in a recession even after other states started to recover from a national recession in 2001, according to Citizen’s Research Council of Michigan.
Pew notes that Michigan is one of the states that spends “considerable amounts” outside of their rainy day funds that also might add to aid the state in economic downfalls.
Although California has been building up its rainy day funds since it depleted its account in the Great Recession, the state is already predicting budget shortfalls.
According to Pew, California can run on rainy day funds for 52.8 days, more than double the median among states and among the top 10 states with the highest number of operating days.
Since 2014, the state requires 1.5% of its General Fund be put into its rainy day funds, according to California Legislative Analyst Office. The state had $20.6 billion in fiscal year 2019, or 14.5% of its spending, in its budget stabilization account.
But because of the nation’s response to the pandemic, such as businesses temporarily closing and layoffs, that can affect the state’s major sources of revenue. Experts covered by the LA Times believe their rainy day funds could be depleted to cover the state’s economic shortfalls.

A good portion of income taxes comes from upper-income Californians, which The Sacramento Bee points out their source of income can vary. This makes it an unreliable source of revenue.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coal India April shipments fall 25.5% as lockdown erodes demand</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Coal India’s shipments in April slumped 25.5 percent from a year earlier after more than a month-long nationwide lockdown halted economic activity, eroding demand for India’s most dominant energy source.
Shipments dropped to 39.1 million tons in the month, the Kolkata-based miner said in a filing late Friday. Output declined 10.9 percent to 40.4 million tons.
Global coal demand is heading for its biggest annual drop since World War II with burning the fuel to make electricity becoming unprofitable and socially untenable in several countries. The pandemic has only served to hasten its demise. The lockdown in India has shut factories and offices slashing electricity demand by about a quarter, affecting the use of coal and causing inventories to swell to record levels.z
India extended the stay-at-home restrictions for most parts of the country for another two weeks starting May 4.
“Coal India’s output is expected to remain muted until demand starts picking up,” Rupesh Sankhe, an analyst at Elara Capital India in Mumbai, said before the company reported the data. “It will probably look at new customers, especially those that depend on imported coal, to shore up shipments.”
Despite the demand for the fuel crashing, the miner has set a higher output and shipments target for the fiscal year that began April 1 on expectations of a revival after the lockdown is lifted, coal minister Pralhad Joshi said last week.

State-run PSU Coal India logged a 25.5% fall in shipments for April as a month-long nationwide lockdown hit economic activity, reducing demand for the country's most dominant energy source. Shipments declined to 39.1 million tonne in April, said the Kolkata-based firm on Friday. In April last year, shipments stood at 52.41 million tonne. 
Output fell 10.9% to 40.38 million tonne last month compared to 45.30 million tonne in April 2019.
Annual demand for coal is seen falling the most since World War II with burning the fuel to make electricity becoming unprofitable and socially untenable in several countries.
PM Modi discusses second economic stimulus package with FM Sitharaman, Home Minister Amit Shah
In India, nationwide lockdown has led to closing of factories and offices leading to a fall in electricity demand by 25%.
Modi government, on May 1, extended the lockdown by another two weeks in the wake of rising cases of novel coronavirus in the country. The third stage of lockdown will start on May 4 and end on May 17.
In January this year, Coal India reported the first decline in annual shipments in at least six years on falling demand from power producers. Shipments declined 3.8 per cent in 2019 from a year ago to 580.8 million tonnes, according to Bloomberg data. Production fell 2.2 per cent to 582.8 million tonne, the data showed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Malaysia defends easing of coronavirus curbs as new infections jump</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian authorities on Saturday defended plans to ease coronavirus lockdown measures next week even as the number of new infections jumped to a two-week high.
Most businesses will reopen on Monday after a six-week shutdown ordered to fight the COVID-19 outbreak, though schools, cinemas and nightclubs will remain closed, along with the country’s borders, and mass gatherings will still be banned.
The decision to allow businesses to resume trading has sparked criticism including from members of the ruling coalition that restrictions were being eased too soon.
The number of new infections with the novel coronavirus as reported by the health ministry rose by 105 on Saturday, the highest daily increase since April 16. The number of known infections totalled 6,176 and fatalities stood at 103.
Security minister Ismail Sabri said Malaysia was not being hasty in relaxing the curbs, stressing that businesses reopening will have to implement hygiene and social distancing measures.
Former Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose UMNO party is part of the ruling coalition, said the easing was “huge and sudden” and there was no rush to reopen the economy, local media reported.
A Change.org petition to stop the measures from being partially lifted had garnered over 250,000 signatures on Saturday.
Announcing the easing of curbs on Friday, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said the government had lost 63 billion ringgit ($14.7 billion) from the restrictions imposed since March 18.
The economy could shrink more than initially forecast due to the curbs, the finance minister said on Saturday. Malaysia’s central bank had in April forecast a change in gross domestic product (GDP) of between -2% and 0.5% this year.
“But that forecast was made after just two weeks of movement curbs. We’re now more than five weeks in ... so our GDP could shrink even more,” Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said in an interview with a local television channel.
Malaysia, which has announced a stimulus package worth 250 billion ringgit to help cushion the economic blow from the outbreak, will also announce an economic recovery plan later this month, the minister said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ICICI Lombard Q4 results: Net profit rises 23.8%, premium income drops</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mumbai: ICICI Lombard has posted a 23.8 percent rise in its March quarter profits at Rs 281.93 crore due to a reduction in underwriting losses even as the private insurer’s premium income dropped both for the quarter and full financial year.
The underwriting loss reduced to Rs 29.42 crore in Q4FY20 as compared to Rs 49.70 crore in the year-ago period. Gross premium income of the company for the quarter stood at Rs.3181 crore as against Rs.3485 crore in the same period last year mainly on account of loss of crop insurance business. Excluding crop insurance, GDPI rose by 2.9 percent YoY to Rs 3,244 crore.
Reduction in underwriting losses was due to a conscious call to not write crop business and also due to pricing improvements in segments like fire insurance, said Bhargav Dasgupta, CEO, ICICI Lombard.
The company’s MTM investment losses came at Rs.550 crore in the quarter mostly on account of financial market meltdown. The overall investment book at the end of the financial year 2019-20 stood at Rs.26300 crore, the company said. Lombard has subsequently made a provision of Rs.120 crore against diminution in the value of investments.
The general insurer's solvency ratio was 217 percent at FY20 as against the minimum regulatory requirement of 150 percent, down from 224% at the end of FY19. The company is not planning on raising any capital in near term even as it had “sufficient headroom” to raise tier 2 capital when required, Dasgupta told reporters at the earnings call.
“We are operating in unprecedented times with pandemic spreading across the world and impacting economies and lives,” said Dasgupta. “Over these weeks we have had to rearrange our processes – from claim settlement to channel operators,” adding that the pandemic would likely bring disruptions in the businesses of all general insurers in the ongoing quarter.
However, he stopped short of giving an assessment on the extent of losses expected given the uncertain nature of the pandemic. “It will require a brave person to predict that (losses to industry), given how things are changing every second day,” Dasgupta said.
The combined ratio – a measure of insurers’ profitability -- stood at 100.4% in FY2020 compared to 98.8% in FY2019 primarily on account of long-term motor policies, change in product-mix and “losses from catastrophic events.” For the reporting quarter it came at 100.1% as against 99% in the corresponding period last year.
The Return on Average Equity (ROAE) was 20.8 percent in FY20 compared to 21.3 percent in FY19. ROAE was 18.8 percent in Q4 compared to 17.5 percent in last year period.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ICICI Lombard's pre-tax profit up 7% in Q4 on improved loss ratio</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Private sector non-life insurer ICICI Lombard reported a 7.27 per cent growth in pre-tax profit for the quarter ending March 2020 (Q4FY20) at Rs 371 crore. This was largely on account of an improvement in loss ratio across corporate segments such as fire insurance, and the no-loss situation in the crop insurance business as it generally shied away from the segment.
The insurer reported a net profit of Rs 282 crore in Q4FY20 compared to Rs 228 crore, registering a growth of 23.8 per cent on account of lower tax outgo for the quarter at Rs 88.7 crore (Rs 118 crore in Q4FY19).
The company's underwriting losses narrowed down to Rs 29.42 crore in Q4FY20, from Rs 49.70 crore a year ago. ICICI Lombard also reported lower underwriting losses for the full year (FY20) at Rs 105.15 crore compared to Rs 169.65 crore in FY19.
The combined ratio of the company, a measure of profitability of non-life insurers, stood at 100.1 per cent in Q4FY20, compared to 99 per cent in Q4FY19. A combined ratio of below 100 indicates that insurer is making underwriting profits.
The gross premium earned by the company was down eight per cent, at Rs 3,181 crore in Q4FY20, mainly due to a decline in crop insurance business. The management said it will be cautious with crop insurance business in FY21 as well. In FY20, the premium earned by the company was down 8 per cent to Rs 13,313 crore from Rs 14, 488 crore in FY19.

ICICI Lombard made underwriting profits in segments like fire, marine, and group health, while it booked underwriting losses in the motor segment and retail health. Given that the third-party hikes for FY21 have been put on hold by the insurance regulator because of the covid-19 disruption, the loss ratios in the segment may shoot up in the future if insurers resort to heavy discounting in the own damage segment. Also, with social distancing being the new norm, the use of private vehicles may see rise and could result in a higher number of accidents and, therefore, more claims for insurers.
In the light of the covid-19 disruption, the company has assessed and provided for impairment of Rs 119 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and Rs 120 crore for the year ended March 31, 2020 on investment assets as per its policy.
The company has maintained a healthy solvency ratio at 2.17x as of March 31, 2020 as against 2.18x at December 31, 2019 and higher than the minimum regulatory requirement of 1.50x. Solvency ratio was 2.24x at March 31, 2019.
It did not declare any dividend at end of the March quarter as the insurance regulator had instructed the companies to take a conscious call on the dividend payment to conserve capital in light of the current situation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ICICI Lombard Q4 net rises 24%</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Private sector general insurance company ICICI Lombard reported 23.8% growth in net profit to ₹282 crore for the quarter ended March 31, as compared to ₹228 crore reported during the same period of the previous year, mainly due to lower underwriting losses.
The gross Direct Premium Income (GDPI) of the insurer was ₹3,181 crore in fourth quarter as compared to ₹3,485 crore in Q4 FY2019.
Excluding crop segment, GDPI of the company increased to ₹3,244 crore in Q4 FY2020 compared to ₹3,153 crore in Q4 FY2019, registering a growth of 2.9%. The industry growth (excluding crop segment) for Q4 FY2020 was 4.3%, the insurer said.
The underwriting loss reduced to ₹29.42 crore in Q4FY20 as compared to ₹49.70 crore in same period the previous year. The insurer said lower underwriting losses were due to the decision of not to write crop insurance business and also because of better pricing in fire insurance.
“Combined ratio stood at 100.1% in Q4 FY2020 compared to 99.0% in Q4 FY2019,” the insurer said. Combined ratio below 100% indicates that an insurer is posting underwriting profits.
“Combined ratio stood at 100.4% in FY2020 compared to 98.8% in FY2019 primarily on account of long-term motor policies, change in product-mix and losses from catastrophic events,” ICICI Lombard said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Private general insurer ICICI Lombard General Insurance posted a 23.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in its March quarter (Q4) net profit at Rs 281.93 crore due to a reduction in underwriting losses.
The underwriting loss reduced to Rs 29.42 crore in Q4FY20 as compared to Rs 49.70 crore in the year-ago period.
Bhargav Dasgupta, MD & CEO, ICICI Lombard General Insurance said that the reduction in underwriting losses was due to a conscious call to not write crop business and also due to pricing improvements in segments like fire insurance.
He added that the company will continue to stay conscious as far as the crop insurance segment is concerned.
As far as Coronavirus (COVID-19) is concerned, Dasgupta said that it is not a balance sheet risk right now since health insurance penetration is low.
"Losses could rise in unoccupied properties since there is nobody looking after the premises. When businesses restart, claims may come up," he added.
ICICI Lombard took an impairment hit of Rs 120 crore in Q4. The mark-to-market losses in the equity book is Rs 550 crore at end of March 31, 2020. However, the overall net investment income rose by 33.6 percent YoY to Rs 418.37 crore in Q4FY20.
Gross direct premium income (GDPI) of the company stood at Rs 3,181 crore for Q4 compared to Rs 3,485 crore a year ago. Excluding crop insurance, GDPI rose by 2.9 percent YoY to Rs 3,244 crore.
All business segments except retail health and motor insurance posted an underwriting profit for Q4.
Dasgupta said that motor insurance segment losses were higher due to the pricing competition in the own-damage segment. Underwriting loss in the motor segment stood at Rs 95.45 crore for Q4FY20 compared to loss of Rs 155.48 crore in the year-ago period.
The combined ratio stood at 100.1 percent in Q4FY20 compared to 99 percent in Q4. A combined ratio below 100 percent indicates that an insurer is posting underwriting profits.
The Return on Average Equity (ROAE) was 20.8 percent in FY20 compared to 21.3 percent in FY19. ROAE was 18.8 percent in Q4FY20 compared to 17.5 percent in Q4FY19.
ICICI Lombard's solvency ratio was 217 percent at March 31, 2020 as against the minimum regulatory requirement of 150 percent.
For the full year (FY20), the insurer's GDPI saw an 8.1 percent YoY decline to Rs 13,313 crore. Excluding the crop segment, ICICI Lombard's GDPI rose by 10.5 percent YoY to Rs 13,302 crore.Moneycontrol Ready ReckonerNow that payment deadlines have been relaxed due to COVID-19, the Moneycontrol Ready Reckoner will help keep your date with insurance premiums, tax-saving investments and EMIs, among others.Download a copy

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI reviews measures to ease financial stress</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das on Saturday held a meeting with the heads of banks and reviewed the economic situation and implementation of various measures announced by it to reduce stress in the financial system amid the COVID-19 crisis.
The meeting, which happened in two separate sessions through video conference, saw participation of managing directors and CEOs of major public and private sector banks, the RBI said in a statement after the meeting.
 
In his opening remarks, the governor appreciated the efforts of banks in ensuring normal to near normal operations during the lockdown period.
During the meeting, among other matters, review of the current economic situation and stability of the financial sector among other things were discussed.
Credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including liquidity to non-banking financial companies, microfinance institutions, housing finance companies, mutual funds, etc and post lockdown credit flows including provision of working capital, with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs were also deliberated.
Implementation of three months moratorium on repayment of loan instalments announced by the RBI was also reviewed during the meeting.
The Supreme Court earlier this week directed the RBI to ensure that its March 27 guidelines directing lending institutions to allow a three-month moratorium to all borrowers is implemented in letter and spirit.
Monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe was discussed, it added.
The Reserve Bank has announced several steps to ease the pressure being faced by borrowers, lenders and other entities including mutual funds and has promised to take more initiatives to deal with the developing situation.
The RBI has injected funds within the system towards lending. The reverse repo rate cut will discourage banks from parking cash with the RBI and encourage them to lend to the economy.
The Indian economy may be headed for a rare quarterly contraction during April-June as economic activities have come to a halt due to the coronavirus lockdown.
The government had earlier unveiled a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package of free foodgrains and cash doles to the poor to deal with the challenges posed by the outbreak  of COVID-19 pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI Governor stresses on need to step up credit flow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HYDERABAD:   Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Saturday reiterated the need to improve credit flow, particularly extending working capital to MSMEs besides implementing the 3-month moratorium in toto. Interacting with the chiefs of major public and private sector banks via a video conference on Saturday, Das acknowledged the banking officials’ contribution during the lockdown and discussed the current economic situation in the country.
Reviewing the current situation, he underscored the need to step up credit flow to different sectors including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), micro finance institutions, housing finance firms and mutual funds. Last week, the central bank even opened a Rs 50,000 crore special liquidity window to enable mutual fund houses to tide over the crisis.
However, the response has been lacklustre with banks borrowing a mere Rs 2,000 crore, implying that the crisis among mutual funds isn’t as severe. Despite RBI reducing the reverse repo rate to 3.25 per cent discouraging banks from sitting on cash, they continued to park suplus funds with the central bank, and as much as Rs 7 lakh crore is parked under the reverse repo window.
Some of the other topics discussed during the meeting included post lockdown credit flows including provision of working capital with special focus on credit flows to small businesses, implementation of three months moratorium on repayment of loan instalments announced by the RBI, monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe and stability of the financial sector, the central bank said in a statement.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI Governor takes up credit flow issue with public, private bank chiefs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Saturday took up the issue of improving credit flow to various sectors of the economy, including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with the chiefs of major private and public sector banks. However, banks said they were looking for a credit guarantee support from the government, while extending loans to NBFCs and also proposed that a decision on extending the three-month moratorium on loan repayments can be taken at the end of May.
The RBI review, called by Governor Shaktikanta Das, has come at a time when non-food credit has plummeted by Rs 33,872 crore to Rs 102.8 lakh crore during the fortnight ended April 10 and the government extended the lockdown by another two weeks to May 17.
The meeting reviewed the current economic situation and credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including liquidity to NBFCs, micro finance institutions, housing finance companies and mutual funds, the RBI said. The meeting, conducted through video conference, also took up post-lockdown credit flows including provision of working capital, with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs and implementation of three months’ moratorium on repayment of loan instalments announced by the RBI.
Explained
With many sectors in the doldrums due to the lockdown, banks are expecting bad loans to rise after June when the moratorium period ends. The extension of moratorium and a government guarantee scheme will give more comfort to the banks which have turned risk averse now.
While banks had extended the loan moratorium to their customers, they have not extended the same facility to NBFCs and MFIs, which borrow from banks. On extending government guarantees to loans to MSMEs and NBFCs, the CEO of a nationalised bank said, “In many countries, the government stepped in and they are giving guarantees particularly for the loans or the incremental credit even to the MSME sector.” This means the liability will be contingent in the books of the government and banks can leverage those guarantees. Banks say it can be a good model to help out borrowers, particularly MSMEs, it’s not clear whether the government is keen on such a proposal.
On the poor credit flow to various sectors, a bank official said, “Unless the economic activity picks up, the demand for credit isn’t likely to pick up and the lack of credit growth is not in my view currently because of any risk aversion.” Though many PSU banks have come out with Covid-19 loan schemes for MSMEs, credit flow has not picked up to the desired levels. The RBI has conducted long-term repo operations (LTRO) for banks at the repo rate of 4.40 per cent, but banks are preferring better rated corporates while ignoring the claims of small units and NBFCs. On extending the moratorium beyond May 31, he said, “Let’s wait till May 31 and then see that what is the demand or what is the situation and depending upon the situation on the ground, I think these are the things which the RBI can take a view and take a calibrated approach. I think the next view probably will be taken after May 31.”
As per the RBI, the Governor “appreciated the efforts of banks in ensuring normal to near normal” operations during the lockdown … Monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe and stability of the financial sector were discussed.
Bank deposits rise on outflows from debt mutual fund segment
While banks witnessed a contraction in credit outstandings, deposits increased during the fortnight ended April 10. Deposits rose by Rs 1,47,435 crore to Rs 137.1 lakh crore, largely due to the outflows from the debt mutual fund segment. However demand deposits (savings accounts) saw an outflow of Rs 1.35 lakh crore, while time deposits (FDs) surged by Rs 2.82 lakh crore. ENS

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Saturday held meetings with heads of domestic banks on the economic situation and credit flow to different sectors of the economy, among other issues, the central bank said in a release .
“The governor held meetings with MDs/CEOs of major public and private sector banks today in two separate sessions through video conference. The meetings were attended by Deputy Governors and other senior officers of RBI,” it said.
Das discussed credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including availability of liquidity to NBFCs, microfinance institutions (MFIs), housing finance companies (HFCs) and mutual funds.
NBFCs and MFIs have been demanding a moratorium on their bank obligations as they have been forced to give similar leeways to their lenders. They have been dealing with lack of liquidity, as banks and mutual funds have become wary of lending to them for fear of defaults.
Independent estimates peg the funding gap for NBFCs at Rs 60,000 crore despite RBI’s efforts to make funds available at cheaper rates. Das also reviewed the current economic situation, post-lockdown credit flow, including provisions for working capital, with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs and implementation of the three-month moratorium on repayment of loan installment announced by RBI.
Medium and small enterprises (MSMEs) have been the worst hit as the extended lockdown has left them starved of cash. Industries have been waiting for a stimulus package from the government, which is yet to see the day of the light.
The RBI Governor also deliberated on monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe and stability of the financial sector during the meetings.

The RBI has been prompting banks to push lending by cutting its key policy rate by 75 basis points to an 11-year low of 4.4%. Besides, it also slashed reverse repurchase rate, a tool to control the money supply, to 3.75% to encourage banks to deploy surplus funds within the system towards lending.
The reverse repo rate cut will discourage banks from parking cash with the RBI and encourage them to lend to the economy.
The Indian economy may be headed for a rare quarterly contraction during April-June as economic activities have come to a halt due to the coronavirus lockdown. The government had earlier unveiled a ₹1.7 lakh crore package of free foodgrains and cash doles to the poor to deal with the challenges posed by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI governor discusses NBFC liquidity, moratorium with bank chiefs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das separately met on Saturday chiefs of public and private sector banks to review India's economy, liquidity of non-bank financial companies (NBFC) and a moratorium for lenders during the coronavirus pandemic.
Deputy governors and other senior officers of the central bank attended the video meeting, too, said the RBI in a statement on its website.
Das took stock of “credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including liquidity to Non-Banking Financial Companies, Micro Finance Institutions, Housing Finance Companies, Mutual Funds, etc.”
He praised banks for their work during a national lockdown to contain the coronavirus, and stressed on ensuring credit “with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises),” the statement said.

Das enquired about the implementation of a three-month moratorium the central bank has announced for repayment of loan installments. The Supreme Court told the RBI on Friday to ensure that banks pass on the moratorium benefits to the customers properly.
The central bank told banks to monitor their overseas branches because of the slowdown in economies across the globe. The meeting also saw discussions around the stability of the financial sector, the RBI statement said.
Early this week, finance ministry reviewed support including emergency credit line extended by large public sector banks to units impacted by Covid-19 triggered lockdown. State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda have together sanctioned close to Rs 10,000 crore as an immediate credit assistance to affected units.
Banks have built internal capacities for assisting companies including MSMEs. The feedback from interactions is expected to act as input for policies that are in works. However, it was not clear when the package would be finalized, officials said.
Credit growth in almost every sector decelerated in March 2020 from a a year ago as the country went into a nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis, data released from the RBI showed.

Credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including liquidity to non-banking financial companies, microfinance institutions, housing finance companies, mutual funds, etc and post lockdown credit flows including provision of working capital, with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs were also deliberated.
Implementation of three months moratorium on repayment of loan instalments announced by the RBI was also reviewed during the meeting.
The Supreme Court earlier this week directed the RBI to ensure that its March 27 guidelines directing lending institutions to allow a three-month moratorium to all borrowers is implemented in letter and spirit.
Monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe was discussed, it added.
The Reserve Bank has announced several steps to ease the pressure being faced by borrowers, lenders and other entities including mutual funds and has promised to take more initiatives to deal with the developing situation.
The RBI has injected funds totalling 3.2 percent of GDP into the economy since the February 2020 monetary policy meeting to tackle the liquidity situation.
The RBI has been prompting banks to push lending by cutting its key policy rate by 75 basis points to an 11-year low of 4.4 percent. Besides, it also slashed reverse repurchase rate, a tool to control the money supply, to 3.75 percent to encourage banks to deploy surplus funds within the system towards lending.
The reverse repo rate cut will discourage banks from parking cash with the RBI and encourage them to lend to the economy.
The Indian economy may be headed for a rare quarterly contraction during April-June as economic activities have come to a halt due to the coronavirus lockdown.
The government had earlier unveiled a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package of free foodgrains and cash doles to the poor to deal with the challenges posed by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Americans without bank accounts must wait for federal checks</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK — As the coronavirus crisis took hold, Akeil Smith’s employer slashed her work as a home health aide to 25 hours per week. Her $15-an-hour salary no longer provided enough to pay her $700 monthly rent, and she had to visit food pantries for groceries.
While millions of U.S. workers have already received a quick relief payment from the federal treasury through direct deposit, Smith is among millions of others without traditional bank accounts who must wait weeks for paper checks. When the checks finally arrive, this disproportionately black and Hispanic population often has little choice but to use expensive check-cashing services to access the money.
“I live check to check, and right now I need more groceries,” Smith, 35, told The Associated Press as she stood inside Payomatic, a small check-cashing store in a predominantly black Brooklyn neighborhood.
In the six weeks since the pandemic shut down much of the U.S. economy, more than 30 million American workers have filed for unemployment insurance. Congress passed a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package.
The government in April began sending $1,200 for each individual, $2,400 for each married couple and another $500 for each dependent child to poor and middle-class families across the United States. Wealthier families get either a reduced payout or nothing depending on their income.
To help smooth the delivery of the payments, the government launched an online portal for people to provide their banking information for direct deposit. But that system offered nothing to people without savings or checking accounts.
A House Ways and Means Committee memo obtained by AP estimated about 5 million paper checks will be issued each week, meaning those most in need could wait many weeks for their payments.
In Houston, Ta’Mar Bethune, a 41-year-old mother of four grown children who is raising a grandchild, is likely to wait awhile. As a younger woman, she struggled for years with affording bank account fees until her account was closed. In the 1990s, she also was a victim of identity theft and never fully recovered.
More than 20 years later, Bethune still cannot pass a standard background check to open a checking account because the banking system views her as too risky, she said. To get by, she transfers the money she makes as a professional hairdresser and babysitter onto a non-bank debit card.
“They charge you an arm and a leg,” she said, citing a monthly fee and a charge for every swipe or withdrawal. “You never get your full money. It’s bad, but I have no other choice.”
Bethune receives financial coaching from the Houston Area Urban League, a nonprofit organization helping low- to moderate-income families examine their behaviors around spending and saving. The organization says many families are reluctant to open bank accounts, especially if they have been burned by the system.
“Nobody wants to be exploited,” said Carmela Walker, a financial coach for the group.
Approximately 8.4 million U.S. households were considered “unbanked” in 2017, meaning that no one in the household had an account, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Another 24.2 million households were “underbanked,” meaning they might have a bank account but members of the household also used an alternative financial service for money orders, check cashing, international remittances, payday loans and pawn shop loans, often at high costs.
Some of those services have been criticized for being predatory and marketing to black and Hispanic communities, which are disproportionately unbanked. Roughly 17 percent of black households and 14 percent of Hispanic households were without a bank account in 2017, compared with just 3 percent of white households and 2.5 percent of Asian American households, the FDIC said.
Banking is a social justice issue with the potential to widen America’s racial wealth gap, said Cy Richardson, vice president of the National Urban League.
“Black America’s economic destiny exists on a razor’s edge right now,” Richardson said.
Advocates say the federal government should use the pandemic payments as an opportunity to bring more people into the banking system via Bank On accounts, which are FDIC insured, cost $5 or less a month and do not allow overdrafts or charge insufficient-fund fees. The accounts can be used for direct deposit, purchases and paying bills.
Otherwise, long lines at check-cashing stores could stretch into the fall and pose dangers to public health.
“There’s now a health component to being unbanked — people are going to have to take literal risks with their health, in order to receive and then spend these dollars,” said Jonathan Mintz, CEO of the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, which aims to get underserved Americans set up with affordable bank accounts.
The opportunity to attract customers with relief payments is not lost on check cashing and payday loan businesses, an $11.2 billion network of storefront locations in cities big and small.
In Brooklyn, B&H Check Cashing, in the predominantly Hispanic neighborhood of Bushwick, posts its rates for cashing checks on a wall. A $1,200 check, for example, would cost $26.76 to cash.
Essence Gandy, 26, stood in a line of two dozen people that snaked outside a PLS Check Cashers in Brooklyn to cash in loose change at a Coinstar kiosk. Her checking account was closed months ago because she had insufficient funds and was unable to get back in good standing.
“I’ve got bills on top of bills,” said Gandy, who also has credit card debts and is behind on payments to a mattress store. She said she hopes to use the federal relief payment to catch up on bills and will likely cash the paper check at PLS.
A representative of PLS, which has 300 locations in 12 states, said it has been informing regular customers that stimulus checks can be cashed at their lowest rates.

As a younger woman, she struggled for years with affording bank account fees until her account was closed. In the 1990s, she also was a victim of identity theft and never fully recovered.
More than 20 years later, Bethune still cannot pass a standard background check to open a checking account because the banking system views her as too risky, she said. To get by, she transfers the money she makes as a professional hairdresser and babysitter onto a non-bank debit card.
“They charge you an arm and a leg," she said, citing a monthly fee and a charge for every swipe or withdrawal. “You never get your full money. It’s bad, but I have no other choice.”
Bethune receives financial coaching from the Houston Area Urban League, a nonprofit organization helping low- to moderate-income families examine their behaviors around spending and saving. The organization says many families are reluctant to open bank accounts, especially if they have been burned by the system.
“Nobody wants to be exploited," said Carmela Walker, a financial coach for the group.
Approximately 8.4 million U.S. households were considered “unbanked” in 2017, meaning that no one in the household had an account, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Another 24.2 million households were “underbanked,” meaning they might have a bank account but members of the household also used an alternative financial service for money orders, check cashing, international remittances, payday loans and pawn shop loans, often at high costs.
Some of those services have been criticized for being predatory and marketing to black and Hispanic communities, which are disproportionately unbanked. Roughly 17% of black households and 14% of Hispanic households were without a bank account in 2017, compared with just 3% of white households and 2.5% of Asian American households, the FDIC said.
Banking is a social justice issue with the potential to widen America’s racial wealth gap, said Cy Richardson, vice president of the National Urban League.
“Black America’s economic destiny exists on a razor’s edge right now,” Richardson said.
Advocates say the federal government should use the pandemic payments as an opportunity to bring more people into the banking system via Bank On accounts, which are FDIC insured, cost $5 or less a month and do not allow overdrafts or charge insufficient-fund fees. The accounts can be used for direct deposit, purchases and paying bills.
Otherwise, long lines at check-cashing stores could stretch into the fall and pose dangers to public health.
“There’s now a health component to being unbanked — people are going to have to take literal risks with their health, in order to receive and then spend these dollars,” said Jonathan Mintz, CEO of the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, which aims to get underserved Americans set up with affordable bank accounts.
The opportunity to attract customers with relief payments is not lost on check cashing and payday loan businesses, an $11.2 billion network of storefront locations in cities big and small.
In Brooklyn, B&H Check Cashing, in the predominantly Hispanic neighborhood of Bushwick, posts its rates for cashing checks on a wall. A $1,200 check, for example, costs $26.76 to cash.
Essence Gandy, 26, stood in a line of two dozen people that snaked outside a PLS Check Cashers in Brooklyn to cash in loose change at a Coinstar kiosk. Her checking account was closed months ago because she had insufficient funds and was unable to get back in good standing.
“I’ve got bills on top of bills,” said Gandy, who also has credit card debts and is behind on payments to a mattress store. She said she hopes to use the federal relief payment to catch up on bills and will likely cash the paper check at PLS.
A representative of PLS, which has 300 locations in 12 states, said it has been informing regular customers that stimulus checks can be cashed at their lowest rates.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Americans without bank accounts must wait for federal checks</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK (AP) — As the coronavirus crisis took hold, Akeil Smith’s employer slashed her work as a home health aide to 25 hours per week. Her $15-an-hour salary no longer provided enough to pay her $700 monthly rent, and she had to visit food pantries for groceries.
While millions of U.S. workers have already received a quick relief payment from the federal treasury through direct deposit, Smith is among millions of others without traditional bank accounts who must wait weeks for paper checks. When the checks finally arrive, this disproportionately black and Hispanic population often has little choice but to use expensive check-cashing services to access the money.
“I live check to check, and right now I need more groceries,” Smith, 35, told The Associated Press as she stood inside Payomatic, a small check-cashing store in a predominantly black Brooklyn neighborhood.
In the six weeks since the pandemic shut down much of the U.S. economy, more than 30 million American workers have filed for unemployment insurance. Congress passed a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package.
The government in April began sending $1,200 for each individual, $2,400 for each married couple and another $500 for each dependent child to poor and middle-class families across the United States. Wealthier families get either a reduced payout or nothing depending on their income.
To help smooth the delivery of the payments, the government launched an online portal for people to provide their banking information for direct deposit. But that system offered nothing to people without savings or checking accounts.

“I live check to check, and right now I need more groceries,” Smith, 35, told The Associated Press as she stood inside Payomatic, a small check-cashing store in a predominantly black Brooklyn neighborhood.
In the six weeks since the pandemic shut down much of the U.S. economy, more than 30 million American workers have filed for unemployment insurance. Congress passed a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package.
The government in April began sending $1,200 for each individual, $2,400 for each married couple and another $500 for each dependent child to poor and middle-class families across the United States. Wealthier families get either a reduced payout or nothing depending on their income.
To help smooth the delivery of the payments, the government launched an online portal for people to provide their banking information for direct deposit. But that system offered nothing to people without savings or checking accounts.
A House Ways and Means Committee memo obtained by the AP estimated about 5 million paper checks will be issued each week, meaning those most in need could wait many weeks for their payments.
In Houston, Ta’Mar Bethune, a 41-year-old mother of four grown children who is raising a grandchild, is likely to wait a while. As a younger woman, she struggled for years with affording bank account fees until her account was closed. In the 1990s, she also was a victim of identity theft and never fully recovered.
More than 20 years later, Bethune still cannot pass a standard background check to open a checking account because the banking system views her as too risky, she said. To get by, she transfers the money she makes as a professional hairdresser and babysitter onto a non-bank debit card.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Not all student loans qualify for forbearance under the CARES Act. Here are the ones that do and don't.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Personal Finance Insider writes about products, strategies, and tips to help you make smart decisions with your money. We may receive a small commission from our partners, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective.
You may have heard that federal student loan payments are in forbearance until September 30 through the CARES Act.
You don't have to contact your student loan servicer to pause payments — they're suspended automatically.
Note that if you've defaulted on your federal student loans, the government may have been taking up to 15% of your paychecks to pay back your loans. The government is pausing wage garnishment for defaulted loans held by the Department of Education until September 30.
This new rule may seem simple enough, but it can be tricky to figure out which loans qualify for forbearance and which do not qualify. You don't want to assume you're off the hook until September 30, only to find out your lender has reported a late payment to credit bureaus because your loan wasn't eligible for forbearance and you've been skipping payments.
If you have a federal loan owned by the Department of Education, your loan is eligible for forbearance under the CARES Act. This includes Direct subsidized loans, Direct unsubsidized loans, Direct PLUS loans, and Direct consolidation loans.
There are two basic types of student loans: federal loans and private loans. Private loans comes from private lenders, including banks, credit unions, colleges, and private companies.
Private student loans do not qualify for forbearance under the CARES Act, but many lenders are offering payment assistance during the coronavirus pandemic. If you find out your lender is providing help, you need to contact an agent to enroll in an assistance program — your loans won't be automatically enrolled in forbearance as your federal student loans would.
Maybe you originally took out federal student loans, but you later refinanced them into one new loan. Refinancing is done by private lenders, so when you refinance federal student loans, they become a private loan.
This means you lose out on any benefits that come with federal loans, including the forbearance program under the CARES Act.
You might have a Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) or a Perkins loan. Some FFEL or Perkins loans are held by the Department of Education, and those are eligible for forbearance.
However, some Perkins loans are funded through colleges, and some FFEL loans are funded through private companies. These do not qualify for forbearance under the CARES Act.
David Klein, CEO of private student loan lender CommonBond, said there is a general rule of thumb for figuring out whether your FFEL loan is held by the Department of Education.
"It generally works is that if you have a federal student loan from before July 1, 2010, then it's likely not held by the federal government," Klein said. "And if you have a federal student loan that was originated after July 1, 2010, it very likely is held by the federal government. The heuristic here is if you got a loan originated after July 1, 2010, then you get the federal relief that's the effective six-month moratorium through September 30."
If you aren't sure whether your FFEL or Perkins loan is held by the Department of Education, contact your student loan servicer to find out.
If you consolidated your federal loans into one Direct loan, the new consolidated loan does qualify for forbearance.
Consolidation and refinancing differ in a few important ways. First of all, you can refinance federal and private loans together, but you can only consolidate federal loans. Second, when you refinance, you take out one new private loan; when you consolidate, you combine your loan into one federal loan.
If you have FFEL or Perkins loans that don't qualify for forbearance right now, you may choose to consolidate them into a Direct loan so they could be eligible for forbearance.
There are a few things to take into consideration before you consolidate, though. The process can take months, so you will still have to make regular payments for a while. If you've been making payments toward forgiveness with the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, you would have to start your payment process from the beginning after you consolidated.

Frederic Oudea also said he expected the bank’s equity ratio to drop to between 11% and 11.5% percent, which would remain 200 to 250 basis points above minimum legal requirements, he said.
Shares in France’s third biggest listed bank fell sharply on Thursday after it surprised investors with a quarterly loss, hiking provisions for bad loans and suffering a revenue wipeout at its equity trading division.
“It is by far the most serious crisis we have had to face,” Oudea told Les Echos. But Oudea added that, unlike during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, banks had enough provisions to cope.
“During the previous crisis, banks were the problem. Today, they have a driving role to play and are taking part in the solution,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM Modi Holds Meeting With Key Ministers; Next Economic Package Targeting Most Affected Sectors Soon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held a series of meetings with key ministers, including Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and top officials of the government to finalise the second economic package targeted at sectors most affected by the lockdown to check Covid-19 spread.
The meetings involving Shah, Sitharaman and other officials of the key economic ministries are taking place for the last few days and the idea is to get inputs on the impact of the current lockdown on different segments of the economy and identify immediate measures that may be required as a relief and revival strategy, sources privy to the developments said.
As part of this effort, Modi had met Shah, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Puri on Friday (1May). The meeting was also attended by Cabinet Secretary Rajeev Gauba and the Principal Secretary to the PM.
Meetings were also held with commerce and MSME ministries on Thursday. On Saturday, the Prime Minister had a review meeting with the Agriculture Ministry to deliberate on the issues and reforms related to the farm sector.
With the government permitting various economic activities to start from May 4 by dividing the country into red, orange and green zones, the immediate concern is to support specific sectors through a package, so that businesses regain lost ground and economic activities gradually return back to normal. The government is also looking at giving a boost to the investment climate through a series of reform initiatives.
Sources said that the government may take a phased approach in this regard the next set of stimulus may have a clear focus on the concerns of the SME segments which have been hit hard due to the Covid-19 outbreak and resultant nationwide lockdown. Revival of small businesses is a key concern for the government.
The Finance Ministry has suggested to the PMO to set up a dedicated fund for micro, small and medium enterprises that could be used to provide both interest free loans to identified industries as well as capital support required to bring enterprises back in business after the lockdown. The size of the fund would be large to extend help to a large number of entities.
The MSME fund may also be used to provide interest subvention on loans taken by the sector to reduce their burden and allow some of these labour intensive segments to operate smoothly.
"The contours of the package are being finalised, and the actual timing of the announcement is still to be worked out. But it would be done soon," said an official source.
Though the next set of package from the government to fight the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to be much wider to cover the concerns of the India Inc., particularly the worst-hit travel and tourism, hospitality and aviation sectors, sources said that the government may adopt a phased approach to see that only such measures that immediately benefit a sector during the lockdown are announced first before looking at measures to bring the economy back on track after the lockdown.
While talks with the stakeholders have taken place in different sectors and their needs have been analysed by the Finance Ministry, it is felt that the MSMEs have been hit hard at different levels and need support immediately.
There is wide speculation that the next economic stimulus package could be bigger than the Rs 1,70,000 crore worth of schemes announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in late March, focusing on providing food security to the poor and giving money in their hands to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.
There is also a suggestion to involve five to six big corporate houses in the production of key items of consumption for the masses so that the country doesn't face shortages once demand picks up. This could be done by providing direct linkages of farmers with corporate entities so that key food produce reaches the factories for processing and production.
While announcing the last package, Sitharaman had indicated that concerns of the India Inc. and SME segments and other sectors of the economy impacted by the present lockdown may be looked at and the government would come up with a plan later.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM Modi chairs meet to discuss agriculture sector reforms</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the government prepares to rejuvenate the economy by easing the lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held a meeting to take stock of reforms in the agriculture sector and discussed various measures, including development of ‘e-NAM into a platform of platforms’ to enable e-commerce and creation of commodity-specific boards or councils to boost agricultural exports.
The high-level meeting, also attended by Home Minister Amit Shah, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, deliberated on the “pros and cons” of bio-technological developments in agriculture.
The meeting comes at a time when reforms in the agriculture sector remain stuck. In July last year, the government constituted a nine-member high-powered committee of Chief Ministers with then Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis being appointed as convenor. The committee was supposed to submit its report within two months but it managed to do so only much later — the recommendations are yet to be made public.
“PM Narendra Modi held a meeting today to deliberate on the issues and reforms required in the agriculture sector. Special emphasis was given on reforms in agriculture marketing, management of marketable surplus, access of farmers to institutional credit and freeing the agriculture sector of various restrictions with appropriate backing of statute,” the PMO said in a statement.
“The focus was on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco-system and bringing appropriate reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development,” said statement.
In a series of meetings this week, the Prime Minister has already reviewed several sectors such as power, education, civil aviation, defence, aerospace, coal and mining; and discussed strategies for boosting investment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM meets Shah, Sitharaman for second stimulus package as lockdown continues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday met two senior ministers and civil servants from the economic ministries to prepare a second stimulus package for the economy hit by a nationwide lockdown triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Modi, after his meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, will hold talks with key economic ministries such as Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME), PTI reported quoting unnamed sources. The finance ministry, which deferred on Friday releasing the monthly Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection numbers, will make a presentation to Modi later in the day on the state of economy and initiatives that it plans to undertake to help the economy.
Modi met with aviation, labour and power ministries on Friday. He had detailed deliberation with commerce and MSME ministries among others on Thursday with focus on attracting both domestic and overseas investment and revival of small businesses in the country so that the recovery process is hastened. Shah and Sitharaman were present in these meetings, reported PTI.
Small businesses, farmers, women, poor, migrant workers and other marginalised sections are likely to benefit from the second stimulus, Business Standard reported on April 28. Industries worst hit by the lockdown--aviation, hospitality, automobiles, real estate, and logistics to name a few—will have to wait. Any support for these sectors and big industry will only happen later down the line, once economic activity normalizes to some extent, officials said.

Sitharaman on March 25 announced a stimulus worth Rs 1.7 trillion or around 0.8 per cent of India’s GDP--much smaller compared to most other G-20 nations. The United States’ stimulus package was pegged at 11 per cent of GDP, that of Australia was at 9.7 per cent, Brazil was at 3.5 per cent, as per data portal Statista.
The government said on Friday it would extend its nationwide lockdown for another two weeks after May 4, but would allow “considerable relaxations” in lower-risk districts marked as green and orange zones under a plan to fight the coronavirus outbreak.
The home ministry issued new guidelines to regulate life and work in this period, based on districts divided into red ( coronavirus hotspot), green and orange zones. There will be considerable relaxations in the districts falling in the green and orange zones, the government said.
A number of activities will remain prohibited throughout the country, irrespective of the zone. Travel by air, rail, metro and inter-state movement by road will remain banned.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Australia's dependence on immigration faces its biggest economic test</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australia's dependence on immigration to grow the economy is about to be sorely tested.
One of the secret ingredients to Australia's unparalleled run of economic growth since the country's last recession has been strong population growth.
While local mums have played their part in swelling the number of locals, the heavy lifting has been done by people from nations such as China, India, Britain, New Zealand and the Philippines who have decided to call Australia home.
Over the past decade, the nation's permanent population has grown by 3.7 million to more than 25 million. Of that increase, 60 per cent was due to net migration.
That extra 2.2 million people have been an economic powerhouse, requiring homes, cars, food and every day goods and services while also contributing fresh skills to the jobs market.
But it has come at a price, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. Be it via higher house prices or over-crowded schools, all levels of government have struggled to keep up with the demands of a growing population while reaping the economic benefits of that population.
The Morrison government made much of its decision in last year's budget to cap permanent migration at 160,000 for four consecutive years as dealing with the congestion pressures on our big cities.
That cap didn't include the hundreds of thousands of temporary migrants – be it students or workers – who help run the economy and add to demand.
But with the borders shut, international students stuck in their home countries and immigration all-but impossible, the issues around migration and Australia's dependence on it cannot be ignored.
The government is now expecting net overseas migration – which was forecast to reach 271,000 in 2019-20 – to be 30 per cent lower. Next year, the drop is tipped to be 85 per cent.
Combined, that's close to 300,000 missing shoppers, students, family members and skilled workers from the economy.
With temporary workers leaving the country and others unable to get in, population growth is likely to stall. Sydney could shrink while Melbourne's stellar growth of recent years will be muted, with serious economic repercussions.
Australia will, post-virus, remain a desirable destination for permanent migrants, temporary ones and international students.
The Morrison government's economic rebuilding plan will have to include a discussion around the nation's dependence of immigration.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Donohoe: Government to 'consider' COVID-19 wage schemes in next few weeks</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe has said the Government is to consider the future of COVID-19 wage subsidy schemes.
He said they will look at both the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Wage Subsidy Scheme in the next few weeks.
It comes after the Cabinet approved supports worth over €6bn for firms to get back to business after the pandemic.
It includes allowing companies to get a low-interest rate loan, a €10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses and ‘warehousing’ of tax liabilities for a period of 12 months.
Minister Donohoe told On The Record that they will be considering changes to the subsidy schemes - since some businesses may still not be able to trade as the country re-opens in phases.
"What we will be looking to do is to change them in line with what is happening in our economy and with public health.
"You can appreciate that these are measures that are costing between €300m to €500m per week.
"And because of that, we need to get the balance right between them being affordable for our country overall, while of course appreciating they're making a massive difference to people who've either lost a job or are still in a job because of the Wage Subsidy Scheme".
He also responded to comments that while new supports have been outlined for businesses, these may not be implemented as they would require legislative changes.
Minister Donohoe said: "I know they are going to be needed soon.
"And even though we are not in position to implement them fully, because some laws have to be passed first, it's going to take us a number of weeks in any event to get the schemes up and running.
"And we can do all of that in advance then of the legislation passing".
He also said he would follow up on reports that some mortgage customers who were approved have since been refused, as they are now on the Wage Subsidy Scheme.
"The Wage Subsidy Scheme is being used by companies that, if we are successful is dealing with COVID - which I believe we will be - these are companies that we believe will be viable and will continue to be successful in the future", he explained.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Commercial rates waiver and €10,000 restart grant - Government's financial plan to reboot economy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Government ministers announced more financial measures today costing up to €6.5bn over the coming years to help “re-boot” the Irish economy.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said €2bn will be made available for loan guarantee schemes for small and medium businesses, a waiving of commercial rates for three months, and a deferral of tax obligations for a period.
The measures are:
“Today’s package of measures aims to help our businesses to restart, reconnect and rehire staff who have been laid off or furloughed,” said Minister Donohoe.
He said the Government has already brought forward a series of measures to support those impacted by this global pandemic.
They have included emergency income support such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. It is now necessary to introduce a number of additional measures to aid the economy as the Covid-19 restrictions start to be lifted.
Minister Donohoe said: “On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.
“We will continue to seek the best ways of supporting our people, and wider society, and rebuilding our economy so that we can get people back to work safely. We will do this by being cognisant of official public health advice and doing what is in the best interests of all our people.”
Finance minister Paschal Donohoe said the measures are designed to "minimise the damage" of the pandemic.
Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys said the economy had moved past the initial shock phase of the coronavirus crisis and was now in a stabilization phase.
The new measures announced today were to fund the third phase – “the re-boot phase.”
She said: “The roadmap announced by Government yesterday outlines a pathway to reopening our economy. This suite of supports represents the next phase in our ongoing response to support businesses through the pandemic and will assist them as they plan for the future’.
“We now have a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst our SMEs.
“The new €250 million Restart Fund in particular will be a critically important tool to support small businesses in our towns and villages to reopen their doors and get back on their feet with supports of up to €10,000 available.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paschal Donohoe: Oireachtas needs to 'come together' for Government business support</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Business supports announced today are reliant on a new Government being formed.
€6bn euro has been unveiled to help companies re-open following Covid-19 restrictions - including a three month waiver on rates to local authorities.
The Taoiseach says he is hopeful a Government could be formed in June.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe says parties need to come together to ensure stability for businesses.
He says: "There is much that can be done in relation to the set up for these funds before legislation is required.
"In order for all of this to be implemented that legislation will be needed [...] This will require the Oireachtas to come together."
Commercial rates are to be waived for three months for business impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The shortfall of €260m on local authorities is to be funded by the Government.
The Government had already brought forward a series of measures to support those impacted by the pandemic - including emergency income support such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.
They have now introduced a number of additional measures to aid the economy as the Covid-19 restrictions start to be lifted.
A €6bn support package for farmers, small, medium and larger businesses has been agreed by Cabinet.
It includes allowing companies to get a low-interest rate loan to re-open their business.
The measures are:
Finance minister Paschal Donohoe said the measures are designed to “minimise the damage” of the pandemic.
Minister Donohoe said: “Covid-19 has created a world that none of us could have imagined just a few short weeks ago. Our collective public health has been targeted; our businesses, and our economy, have been shouldered with an unimaginable burden; and our society is grappling with this new reality.
.
"But, by working together, we are minimising the damage. The hard work of the Irish people has ensured that we are getting to grips with this disease, our people are united in caring for one another under the most extreme of circumstances and our businesses are attempting to adapt to this new and most challenging environment.
“On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.
Group calls on Govt to implement five measures to help retailers recover from pandemic
"We will continue to seek the best ways of supporting our people, and wider society, and rebuilding our economy so that we can get people back to work safely. We will do this by being cognisant of official public health advice and doing what is in the best interests of all our people.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Flight Centre to stop charging cancellation fees amid criticism</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Flight Centre has decided to stop charging cancellation fees to customers whose travel has been impacted by COVID-19.
The travel agent had been charging a $300 per person cancellation fee for bookings from before the outbreak, with some law firms and customers considering a class action against the practice.
But in a letter sent to customers on Saturday, Flight Centre backed down from that position. The new policy applies retrospectively to cancellation fees already paid.
“The decision to waive [cancellation] fees will impact our business, nevertheless we have heard your feedback and we believe this step is the right one for the current economic conditions where stand downs and job losses are a daily occurrence for many Australians,” Flight Centre Travel Group executive general manager Allisa O’Connell wrote in the letter.
“The waiver follows ongoing discussions with customers and regulators, including the ACCC [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission], and will apply retrospectively to bookings cancelled as a result of COVID-19 on or after 13 March 2020 for which a Flight Centre Cancellation Fee was charged. Please note this waiver applies to our fees – we cannot waive fees or conditions that airlines and other third party suppliers impose.”
The ACCC welcomed Flight Centre's move and said it would have taken legal action if the travel group had not made the decision.
“This is a very welcome move made by Flight Centre today for thousands of customers impacted by COVID-19 travel cancellations,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.
“We are continuing to discuss issues in relation to refunds and cancellations with the travel sector, and encourage travel providers to treat consumers fairly in these exceptional circumstances.”
Ms O’Connell also confirmed Flight Centre staff would continue to perform the “time consuming task” of processing refunds. The travel agent has come under fire for delays in getting money back to its customers.
Flight Centre will also offer customers travel vouchers of up to $200 per person for those who do not request a refund and instead take credits for future travel.
The ACCC said it had received 6000 complaints related to travel companies refund policies.
“We ask consumers to remain patient and be mindful of the significant pressures on businesses at this time and, where possible, contact the business by email or website, rather than by phone,” Mr Sims said.
“These are very complex issues and may take smaller businesses more time to respond.”
Ms O’Connor also reiterated that Flight Centre was “well placed financially to weather a prolonged downturn” in the travel industry.
The company said those who accepted a credit voucher could get a refund, without having to pay fees, at the end of December 2021, if travel still isn't possible.
Flight Centre had defended the $300 fee – which was included in its terms and conditions – saying it covers lost commissions, as well as the time and cost involved in managing the refund process.
The embattled travel group is closing 428 Australian stores by the end of July in an attempt to radically slash costs while raising $900 million in fresh equity and debt to last it through the coronavirus pandemic.
The Agereported in April on Melbourne midwife Jacqueline Vella who lost thousands, including $1500 in fees, when she had to cancel a trip to Europe and the United States.
Flight Centre then decided to cap its cancellation fees about a week later, and a day after The Age reported a class action law suit was being planned.
This week, a mother suffering from muscular dystrophy pleaded with Flight Centre to refund the almost $20,000 she spent on a trip with her family.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Canadians may have to settle for travel vouchers, over refunds: BBB</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Canadians still dealing with cancelled travel plans may have to accept a travel voucher over a full refund, according to central Ontario's Better Business Bureau (BBB).
The consumer watchdog received 262 formal complaints over the past few weeks. Most stemming from customers looking for help receiving a refund for their cancelled trips.
On Friday, Patrick McKeen, President, BBB, appeared on Kitchener Today with Brian Bourke on 570 NEWS. He said there wasn't much the BBB can do in these situations.
As the pandemic grew to encompass the world, countries began recalling their citizens and closing their borders. While some travel agencies offered initial refunds early on, many started to fall back onto their terms and conditions.
"Although there's been lots of information in the news around getting full refunds, it's still within the terms and conditions of the ticket that were booked, for the travel operator to offer a voucher instead of a full refund," he said.
The travel and hospitality industries were heavily affected by the pandemic, making it even less likely for tickets to get fully refunded. McKeen said it was best to be flexible and reschedule your trip, or take the travel voucher for now.
He advises people to always read the terms and conditions, but he acknowledges that no one could have expected the pandemic, let alone have specific protections for it.
If the agency that booked the tickets falls under, McKeen said customers can be compensated. As long as that agency was registered with the Travel Industry Council of Ontario (TICO), they can take advantage of their compensation fund and be fully reimbursed.
You can contact the BBB and file complaints online at bbb.org, or by phone at 519-579-3080.

Discussions began this week regarding cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, according to the report.
Along with its industry peers, NBCUniversal is taking a financial hit from the coronavirus outbreak which has shuttered movie theaters and theme parks. The company has temporarily closed its theme parks and suspended its sports productions and most of its film and TV production.
Although all divisions are being looked at, some areas likely to be under a microscope at NBCUniversal are the theme-parks division and Universal Pictures, the WSJ reported.
NBCUniversal declined to comment on the report.
The company, which reported its results earlier this week, said its quarterly revenue at the filmed entertainment unit fell 22.5% this quarter from a year earlier, while revenue at theme parks fell 31.9%.
Last month, Walt Disney Co said it will start furloughs of non-essential US employees across the company.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM Modi discusses reforms in agriculture sector</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amid coronavirus-induced lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday deliberated on ways to reform the agriculture sector with emphasis on agriculture marketing, access of farmers to institutional credit and freeing the sector of various restrictions with appropriate backing of laws. Agriculture accounts for 15 per cent of India's gross domestic product and is a source of livelihood for more than half of the country's 1.3 billion population.
The government has maintained that the country's farm sector is functioning smoothly despite the Covid-19 lockdown and there will not be much impact on its growth in the current fiscal, unlike other sectors.
The pros and cons of bio-technological developments in crops or enhancement of productivity and reduction in input costs was also deliberated, an official statement said.
The meeting also focused on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco-system and bringing appropriate reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development.
Concessional credit flow to strengthen agriculture infrastructure, special Kisan Credit Card saturation drive for PM-Kisan beneficiaries and facilitating inter and intra-state trade of agriculture produce to ensure fairest return to farmers were some of the other important areas covered, the statement said.
Developing eNAM or the National Agriculture Market into a "platform of platforms" to enable e-commerce was one of the important topics of discussion on Saturday.
Discussion also emanated on the possibilities of a uniform statutory framework in the country to facilitate new ways for farming which will infuse capital and technology in the agrarian economy.
The challenges of the Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016 and how to protect the interest of small and marginal farmers was discussed in detail.
Ways to make the Essential Commodities Act compatible with present times so that large-scale private investment in post-production agriculture infrastructure is incentivised, and how it has a positive effect on commodity derivative markets, was also discussed.
Developing 'Brand India', creation of commodity specific boards/councils and promotion of agri-clusters or contract farming are some of the interventions that were deliberated to boost agriculture commodity export.
The use of technology in the agriculture sector is of paramount importance as it has the potential to unlock the entire value chain for the benefit of farmers.
PM Modi emphasised on the dissemination of technology till the last mile and making farmers more competitive in the global value chain.
It was decided to further strengthen the role of Farmers Producer Organisations (FPOs) to bring vibrancy in agrarian economy, transparency in agriculture trade and enable maximum benefits to the farmers.
Overall emphasis was on revisiting the existing laws governing market for better price realisation and freedom of choice to the farmers, the statement said. Agriculture and allied sector's growth stood at 3.7 per cent during the 2019-20 fiscal.

The pros and cons of biotechnological developments in crops or productivity enhancement and reduction in input costs were also deliberated, an official statement said.
The meeting discussed strategic interventions in the marketing ecosystem and reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development. Concessional credit flow to strengthen infrastructure, a special Kisan Credit Card saturation drive for the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) beneficiaries and facilitating inter- and intra-State trade of agriculture produce to ensure the fairest return to farmers were some of the other important areas covered, the statement said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Women Jan Dhan bank account holders will start getting the second installment of Rs. 500 from Monday in line with the announcement made by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in March.
To help the poor tide over the COVID-19 crisis, the government had on March 26 said ex-gratia payment of Rs. 500 would be credited to women Jan Dhan account holders for the next three months, starting from April.
“Installment of Rs.500 for the month of May has been sent to the bank A/cs of PMJDY women beneficiaries under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package. Beneficiaries are requested to follow the schedule shared below to visit banks & CSPs. Money can also be withdrawn via ATMs & BCs,” Financial Services Secretary Debasish Panda said in a tweet on Saturday.
The transfer has been staggered over a period of five days to avoid rush at the bank branches. This will help in ensuring social distancing and avoid overcrowding in banks, he said.
As per the schedule, women account holders under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) having account number with last digit as 0 and 1 will get the money in their account on May 4, while accounts ending with 2 or 3 can approach the bank on May 5. On May 6, beneficiaries with account numbers ending with 4 or 5 can collect their money, while accounts ending with 6 or 7 may withdraw on May 8. The last tranche would be remitted on May 11 for account numbers ending with 8 or 9, the tweet said.
In case of emergency, one can withdraw the money immediately. However, for orderly disbursal, one must follow the banks’ payment plan, it said. Beneficiaries may withdraw any day at their convenience after May 11, it added.
Beneficiaries are encouraged to use the neighbourhood ATMs with RuPay cards, Bank Mitras and customer service points (CSPs) as much as possible to avoid crowding at the branches, it said. “Please note that there will be no charges for withdrawing money from other bank ATMs, at present, as per the government directives,” it said.
During April as many as 20.05 crore women Jan Dhan account holders received Rs. 500 each in their accounts as the first installment. The total disbursement under the head was Rs. 10,025 crore as on April 22.
In a bid to mitigate hardship caused by the coronavirus crisis, the government in late March announced a Rs. 1.7 lakh crore stimulus package comprising free foodgrains and cooking gas to poor and cash doles to poor women and elderly.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bank transfer of second installment of ₹500 to women Jan Dhan account holders from Monday: FinMin</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Finance Ministry has begun crediting the second (May) instalment of ₹500 to the women account holders of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) as part of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyana Package ( PMGKP), a top official said.
“Instalment of ₹500 for the month of May has been sent to the bank A/Cs of PMJDY women beneficiaries under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package. Beneficiaries are requested to follow the schedule shared below to visit banks and CSPs. Money can also be withdrawn via ATMs and Business Correspondents”, the Department of Financial Services Secretary Debasish Panda tweeted on Saturday.
The money in the bank is safe, and there is no need to rush for withdrawal, the DFS has said. For bank accounts ending with 0 and 1, the date of disbursal will be May 4. It will be May 5 for those with bank accounts ending on 2 and 3; May 6 for those with bank accounts ending with 4 and 5. Those with bank accounts ending with 6 and 7 can get their monies on May 8, and the date of disbursal will be May 11 for those with bank accounts ending with 8 and 9. After May 11, beneficiaries may withdraw any day at their convenience. This will help in ensuring social distancing and avoiding overcrowding in banks.

It may be recalled that the Centre had in April disbursed through direct benefit transfer (DBT) the first instalment of ₹500 to 20.05 crore PMJDY women beneficiaries involving an aggregate amount of ₹10,025 crore as part of PMGKY. In all, the Government intends to transfer ₹1,500 to each PMJDY woman beneficiary over three instalments under the PMGKP. More than 38 crore accounts have been opened under PMJDY as on April 1, 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Three quarters of British truckers expect to go out of business within just 2 months due to the coronavirus outbreak</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">UK truckers are warning Boris Johnson's government that they could go out of business in weeks without more financial support for dealing with the impact of the coronavirus on their industry.
The truckers are playing a vital role in transporting essentials like food and PPE around Britain during the coronavirus pandemic, but their futures still look bleak. Three-quarters say they don't expect their jobs to survive beyond two months, a stark new survey, conducted in the latter part of April and published this weekend, has found.
The Road Haulage Association (RHA), the trade body representing the trucking industry in the UK,  asked its members a series of questions about how the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus had affected their trade.
When asked by the RHA how long they expect their livelihoods to survive at current volume, 75% said two months or less, while 52% said no more than a month. 13% said they expected to go out of business within two weeks.
Richard Burnett, the RHA's Chief Executive, this week, wrote to the government asking for five emergency measures to help the truckers whose cashflow has been torpedoed by the outbreak of the virus and subsequent nationwide lockdown.
They included a temporary suspension of business rates and fuel tax, plus a retention scheme to cover the cost of trucks not in action.
Industry figures have warned the UK government that most haulage operations in the UK are small-to-medium sized companies that will struggle to survive for much longer if their cashflow problems continue. Many already have small profit margins and are reluctant to apply for government loans, as they don't want to take on more debt.
The pain being inflicted on the industry is particularly acute for truckers moving loads, which aren't food and PPE.
Demand for other goods like clothing has plummeted amid the COVID-19 outbreak, while the UK government's strict social distancing measures have forced shops, restaurants, and factories across the country to close.
"If the economy is to recover from this, it is important that we can switch on the supply chain as individual sectors begin their recovery," Burnett said this week.
"No-one knows for sure when that will be, but we must make sure that the industry is up and ready to go at very short notice. We recognize that we need to play the fullest role possible in the UK's recovery and these measures would ensure we can do just that."
The RHA findings published this weekend illustrate the scale of the challenge facing the trucking sector.
LoadingSomething is loading.
73% of respondents said their cash flow had significantly reduced or worsened, with 13% saying they have no cash flow whatsoever. 56% have applied to the UK government's furlough scheme to cover the wages of out-of-work staff.
A figure in the logistics industry, who wished not to be named, told Business Insider: "The situation is dire.
"Ports are suffering, hauliers in non-food or PPE segments are really struggling and facing collapse really struggling, and even those carrying food are facing increasingly tough competition."
A UK government spokesperson told Business Insider:"Hauliers are vital to the nation's battle against Covid-19, and to help support the sector we have made changes to road transport operator licensing, vehicle testing, driver medical renewals, driver training and drivers hours.
"We continue to work with the sector and encourage all firms to make use of the unprecedented package of measures announced by the Chancellor, including £330bn of government backed loans, cash grants and support with tax bills, to help businesses through this difficult time."
However, opposition parties said ministers needed to give industry more support.
Responding to the RHA findings, Labour's Shadow Transport Secretary Jim McMahon said: "Our lorry drivers are essential workers who are keeping the supermarket shelves stocked and delivering other vital supplies.
"Much of this is imported but there are fewer goods going in the opposite direction, putting a big strain on the viability of road hauliers.
"There are real concerns that the furlough scheme needs to have greater flexibility in sectors like road transport. The government should listen to industry and the trade unions and give them the support that employers and workers need to survive the crisis."
Bill Esterson, Labour MP and shadow trade minister, said: "We have to keep this essential industry going to maintain our food supply and viable for us to restart international trade when we eventually emerge from the crisis."
Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat Transport and International Trade spokesperson, told Business Insider "the Government must do whatever is necessary to support haulage companies.
"This is about protecting vital supply lines for food and medicine as the coronavirus crisis continues."
She added: "Liberal Democrats are also calling on Ministers to listen to business and find an urgent fix to the business loans scheme, so that small businesses can access the finance they need. Otherwise, people's livelihoods are at risk."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Emirates SkyCargo set to connect New Zealand with key global markets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: Emirates SkyCargo has announced that that will be launching four weekly cargo services to New Zealand from May 3, 2020 to help connect businesses in the country to key trading partners across the globe.
The air cargo carrier is working with the Government of New Zealand as part of its International Airfreight Capacity (IAFC) scheme to help facilitate the exports of key commodities from New Zealand to the rest of the world while ensuring that essential cargo continues to be transported into the country.
Emirates SkyCargo will be operating 3 weekly Dubai-Auckland-Melbourne-Dubai flight rotations and a once a week Dubai-Sydney-Christchurch-Sydney-Dubai flight service operated by the carrier’s Boeing 777-300ER passenger freighters.
Emirates SkyCargo will be providing a vital cargo lane for the exports of high quality exports from New Zealand including food items such as chilled meat, honey, dairy products, and seafood to various destinations in the Middle East and Europe. The flight service is also expected to help transport pharmaceuticals and medical appliances to markets in the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
“Emirates SkyCargo is delighted to working with the Government of New Zealand to help connect fresh produce of the highest quality and other key exports from Auckland and Christchurch. We consider it our responsibility to ensure that we are able to facilitate adequate supply of food and other essential commodities to markets that we serve and also support exporters in New Zealand at the same time,” said Nabil Sultan, Emirates Divisional Senior Vice President, Cargo.
Emirates SkyCargo is operating dedicated cargo flights on its Boeing 777 freighters and Boeing 777-300ER passenger freighters to more than 60 destinations across six continents. Through a mix of scheduled flights and charter operations, the air cargo carrier has helped transport thousands of tonnes of vital protective equipment and food across the world during the Covid-19 pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">International Cargo Flights Ramp Up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Government support to help restore international air freight capacity has added 56 weekly cargo flights from New Zealand, with more to come, Transport Minister Phil Twyford announced today.
The International Air Freight Capacity scheme adds capacity for high-value export cargo and maintains trade links with key global markets. It also ensures there are essential imports such as medical supplies.
Phil Twyford says it is vital air freight capacity recovers as New Zealand responds to the COVID-19 global pandemic.
“At the beginning of the pandemic, we moved quickly to support charter flights to ensure New Zealand had the crucial supplies it needs and to back our exporters. However, these flights only allowed businesses to export to a limited number of markets.
“This scheme builds on that support, with a schedule of weekly flights to a greater number of global markets. This new schedule restores more export markets to more businesses and with greater frequency.
“There is a huge demand for air freight, at a time when capacity is limited. This scheme helps provide certainty for business, while airlines and carriers respond to a changing world.
“The $330 million scheme is short-term and market-led. Funding is provided to guarantee cargo on key routes under agreements with the carriers. Carriers then offer that capacity directly to freight customers on commercial terms.
“We invited commercial proposals to deliver air freight capacity with key markets. The first successful applicants are Air New Zealand, China Airlines, Emirates, Freightways Express, Qantas and Tasman Cargo. We are working with other carriers, and expect to make further announcements shortly.
“We are closely monitoring the international air freight market, and will respond based on how the COVID-19 situation evolves. As the market recovers, we will reassess the need for funding.
“The Government set aside $600 million for the aviation sector as part of its $12.1 billion COVID-19 support package. Acknowledging the impacts of the pandemic on the domestic aviation sector, the Government has also provided immediate funding for local air freight and lifeline air services.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Precision Air now ventures into cargo business to keep flying</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Precision Air is expecting to launch its first cargo-only flight next week as one amongst many innovative business strategies to navigate around the economic hurdles brought by the Covid-19.
Dar es Salaam. Precision Air is expecting to launch its first cargo-only flight next week as one amongst many innovative business strategies to navigate around the economic hurdles brought by the Covid-19.
The airline is currently targeting Comoros Islands and Nairobi destinations, with a plan of flying general cargo, except dangerous goods, an official said.
Precision Air would deploy one of its ATR 72 – 500, with a capacity of an average of 5.5 tonnes for a one hour flight, according to its chief executive officer Mr Patrick Mwanri.  
Last week, Precision Air secured the approval from the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA) to use passenger cabin for cargo.  
This suggests that they can now either remove the seats completely or use while they are there, provided that instructions by the aircraft’s manufacturer are adhered to.
The airline’s boss said using passenger cabin for cargo is a way to serve the rising demand of goods transportation especially now that most countries are on shutdown.

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, most countries were being served by big airlines that used to bring in passengers alongside with cargo.
However, restrictions on international passenger commercial flights, have created cargo space shortage.
“Cargo has now become the available options for airlines to continue operations as we wait for the market to open up to its normal situation,” Mr Mwanri told The Citizen via an email. 
Currently, revenue from passengers, he added, has severely been hit especially after suspension of international commercial passenger flights in different regional destinations.
Mr Mwanri said Precision Air had until late last month recorded a drop of over 81 percent of passenger number compared to the same period last year.
The public listed company continues its operations in the domestic market with reduced capacity caused by reduced demand of passengers.
Mr Mwanri added that their daily operation has dwindled from an average of 53 before the pandemic to less than 10 sectors per day.  
In response to the reduction in domestic operations, Precision Air, which has 400 staff, has been forced to cut salaries of its workers by up to more than 50 percent.
 “Since our sales team is somehow idle, we engage them to concentrate much with cargo sales to ensure we serve our clients better during this time,” said the Precision Air’s top leader.
To cope with the crisis, the company has also undergone significant reduction on third party services such as ground handling, security and causal labors under engineering section.
“Based on the nature of services, some activities have been replaced by the Precision Air’s own staff,” said Mr Mwanri.
 Other Measures taken in the response to the Covid-19 includes, suspension of onboard catering services to curb spread of the pandemic.
Also in the basket of measures is a review and adjustment of operating schedule to accommodate the current demand through rerouting, combination and cancellation of some routes.
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, last month TCAA announced suspension of all scheduled and non-scheduled international commercial passenger flights until further notice.  
However, a decision by the regulator came in when the agony is continuing as air transport has been shaken since February 2020 due to the pandemic.
Precision Air suspended its only Nairobi and Entebbe international flights in March and at the same, most of foreign airlines decided to suspend flights to Tanzania.

This includes a Crivit outdoor trampoline, Smoby garden slide, Gemini swingset and a wooden kitchen.
In a statement, the company says: "At Lidl, the safety of our colleagues and customers is our number one priority.
"We have implemented numerous measures across all of our stores over the past two months in order to ensure appropriate social distancing can be achieved.
"Due to unprecedented and exceptional demand on certain items in recent days, we have seen queues form outside our stores prior to opening.
"These queues have made social distancing externally more challenging".
It adds that the items, which were due to be sold on Monday May 4th, will go on sale at a later date.
It has apologised to customers - but says "the safety of our team and customers must take priority at this challenging time."

    <h5 class="mb-1">B&Q, Homebase and Wickes: All the shops open today with queues forming outside some stores</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The UK remains in lockdown but several stores have been begun slowly reopening across Bristol and the rest of the country.
Homebase is one the many chains which are now open to customers, with the Portishead store reopening earlier this morning (May 2) after rival DIY retailer  B&Q reopened some of its branches too.
Other big names, such as B&Q, KFC and Burger King, have also reopened in Bristol with social distancing measures in place.
Here are the shops open to customers today.
Homebase fully reopened 20 stores  across the UK last month as part of a trial run.
The retailer was classified as an essential retailer in March but temporarily closed to ensure the safety of staff and customers.
Following the trial run, a further 50 stores were then fully reopened - including the Portishead store.
The DIY chain reopened some of its stores last month, including the  Hartcliffe  and Longwell branches in Bristol, following closure at the start of lockdown.
The chain's store at Cribbs Causeway has also opened.
A long queue of customers was seen at the entrance to the Hartcliffe store after the reopening, standing on two-metre markers on the ground.
Six branches of Wickes, the nearest to Bristol being Cheltenham, are now open to the public with strict social distancing measures in place to protect colleagues and customers.
In addition to the new measures, the trial stores will operate shorter opening hours from Monday to Saturday, opening at 7am and closing at 6pm, with Sunday reverting to the trading hours of 10am to 4pm.
Initiatives that have been successfully deployed by other major retailers are being introduced to ensure customers can shop safely and colleagues remain protected, said a spokesperson.
The government has clarified garden centres and other retailers  are allowed to operate a click and collect service.
In Bristol and surrounding areas, many garden centres are operating a delivery service to ensure they can still serve customers.
Garden centres open for delivery service across Bristol include Henleaze Garden Shop, Almondsbury Garden Centre, Whitehall Garden Centre, Fonthill Garden Centre, Iron Acton Garden Centre, Brackenwood Garden Centre and Elmwood Nursery and Garden Centre.

Burger King reopened two restaurants for delivery in Bristol earlier this month.
The stores are in  Bristol  – the St Philips Causeway site in Arnos Vale and the one in Eastgate Retail Park, Eastville.
Hundreds of KFC restaurants have reopened across the UK for delivery service, including two here in Bristol.
The Bristol branches which have reopened are at Avonmeads Retail Park and Shield Retail Park.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lidl has cancelled the sale of a number of items which were due to go on sale Monday, May 4th.
In recent days, the company has seen queues forming outside its supermarkets before opening as people looked to purchase items which were anticipated to be in high demand.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New head of Alberta Energy Regulator wants to rebuild confidence in leadership</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CALGARY — Like a sports coach coming off a disappointing season, the new head of the agency that regulates Alberta's heavily challenged energy industry knows he's got some work to do.
"One (goal) is rebuilding confidence in the leadership internally," Laurie Pushor said in an interview.
"Confidence in the public and government and the industry that we are a good team of people and that we're doing our best and that we're open to continuing to improve."
Pushor, two weeks into the job, replaces Jim Ellis as boss of the Alberta Energy Regulator. Ellis left last November after investigators found serious mismanagement, misuse of about $2.3 million and a "culture of fear" among whistleblowers.
"Improvement will include continuing to strengthen transparency and continuing to strengthen accountability for our performance," Pushor promised.
That's not the only challenge he and the energy regulator face.
There's an enormous backlog of abandoned and orphaned wells that will cost someone billions to clean up. There are difficult relationships between the regulator, First Nations and landowners.
And there's the industry itself for which profits and reserves are declining.   
Don't count Alberta out yet, said Pushor. Notwithstanding the uncertainties of COVID-19 and international oil price wars, there's still money to be made, he said.
"If you look at recovery rates and the innovation that industry is applying to known reserves, not only might we not be presiding over an industry in decline, but you might see a bit of a renaissance in conventional production."
Rebuilding trust with First Nations is another priority for Pushor. In his previous job as Saskatchewan's deputy minister of energy and resources, he worked with a traditional knowledge-keeper, he said.
"He is relentless in reminding me that it's about relationships," said Pushor, who promises plenty of face-to-face time with Indigenous leaders.
"If you're not in a relationship, you're not going to be able to move things forward. We, as the regulator, need to be in a good relationship with First Nations."
Pushor wants the same kind of contact with landowner groups, who have often been critical of how industry uses their land and treats them.
"It'll start with three or four of the larger groups out there that have organized. I look forward to catching up and understanding their issues and seeing what can be done to move things ahead."
When it comes to cleaning up wells, Pushor acknowledges he's got some work to do to grasp the legal ins and outs. Critics have long pushed for a legislated timeline for dealing with old infrastructure and say that the province's calculations on whether a well owner has the wherewithal for cleanup are antiquated.
Pushor asks for a little time to dig into those issues.
"The government's the policymaker," he said. "They're going to give us the framework they want us to operate in."
There's an inevitable tension between business, environmental and public concerns, Pushor said.
"That tension is real and it should be. What makes a regulator effective is ensuring that tension is balanced."
He believes the public still has faith in the Alberta Energy Regulator, despite its internal and external problems.
"Confidence in the industry and the regulator, while they may have eroded somewhat, remains relatively stable. But we can always do better and we should."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Greats likes Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev have pledged their support to Indian Cricketers Association's (ICA) initiative to financially help around 30 needy players amid the nationwide lockdown, said its president Ashok Malhotra.
The ICA has so far raised Rs 39 lakh to help former cricketers who are in dire need of funds.
"Big names like Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Gautam Gambhir and Gundappa Viswanath have joined us and that is a major boost to our initiative. A corporate from Gujarat has also offered its support," Malhotra said.
It has been learnt that the likes of Gavaskar, Dev and Gambhir have also made financial contributions to the cause. Mohammad Azharuddin had pledged his financial support earlier this week.

The ICA will continue to accept donations until May 15, following which it will shortlist 5-6 cricketers from each zone (north, east, west, south and central).
"Cricketers who don't have jobs, who don't get pension from the BCCI or their respective state associations will be offered help," Malhotra had said earlier.
The ICA has contributed Rs 10 lakh to the initiative.
As many as 1750 former cricketers are registered with the ICA, India's first-ever players' association that came into being last year.
The ICA had received an initial grant of Rs 2 crore from the BCCI in February to kick-start its operations.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Greats likes Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev have pledged their support to the Indian Cricketers’ Association’s initiative to financially help around 30 players amid the nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, said ICA president Ashok Malhotra.
The ICA has so far raised Rs 39 lakh to help former cricketers who are in need of financial help.
“Big names like Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Gautam Gambhir and Gundappa Viswanath have joined us and that is a major boost to our initiative. A corporate from Gujarat has also offered its support,” Malhotra told PTI.
It has been learnt that likes of Gavaskar, Dev and Gambhir have also made financial contributions to the cause. Mohammad Azharuddin had pledged his financial support earlier this week.
The ICA will continue to accept donations till May 15, following which it will shortlist 5-6 cricketers from each zone (north, east, west, south and central).
“Cricketers who don’t have jobs, who don’t get pension from the BCCI or their respective state associations will be offered help,” Malhotra had said earlier.
The ICA has contributed Rs 10 lakh to the initiative.
As many as 1750 former cricketers are registered with the ICA, India’s first-ever players’ association which came into being last year.
The ICA had received an initial grant of Rs 2 crore from the BCCI in February to kick-start its operations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will US exchange trading floors still be relevant post-coronavirus?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK: The coronavirus pandemic has upended US equities trading with unprecedented market volatility and forced bourses like the New York Stock Exchange to close their trading floors, raising questions about the need for such spaces.
The NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc , closed its stock and options trading floors in New York and San Francisco in Mar 23 after traders and an ICE employee tested positive for the virus. Rivals CME Group , Cboe Global Markets Inc and Nasdaq Inc also closed their options and futures pits in Chicago and Philadelphia.
Despite the move to all-electronic trading, none of the exchange operators experienced any major technical glitches amid record volumes, and all of them reported first-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations.
Cboe aims to reopen its options trading floor on Jun 1 after acknowledging that some customers were frustrated by the exchange's electronic trading tools and were unable to get the most risky and complex types of orders completed, it said on Friday.
At the same time, Chief Executive Ed Tilly said Cboe will soon roll out new electronic solutions that will replicate benefits of the floor for those more complex orders, prompting analysts to question the need to reopen the spaces at all.
"Our position has always been that when our customers tell us that there's no utility in the trading crowd, when brokers provide no service to their customers, the electronic solution will close the trading floor, not Cboe and not its management team," Tilly said.
The NYSE is the only US exchange that still operates stock trading floors alongside electronic trading. It released a study on Thursday showing that floor traders dampen volatility by providing tighter bid-offer spreads, especially at the market close, saving investors millions of dollars a day.
While the floor distinguishes NYSE from its competitors, the closure has not led to a significant drop in market share, according to an analysis released Friday by industry trade group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.
"Only time will tell if investors feel the difference in execution of their trades with or without the human interaction on the floor," the study said.
The NYSE plans to reopen its San Francisco-based options floor on Monday. It has not given a date for the reopening of its iconic floors at 11 Wall Street.
CME, which runs the world's largest futures exchange, said on Wednesday it was unclear when it would reopen its trading floors, where about 10 per cent of its business was done.
"We will not do anything irrational either way until we know exactly where health officials and government officials are going to come down as far as multiple people getting together in a single location," CEO Terry Duffy told analysts on a call.
The closure had little effect on trading activity, CME said.
"Participants can trade any strategy today as easily as they could prior to the closure of the floor," said Sean Tully, a senior managing director at the exchange.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Explained: Why Elon Musk’s tweet on Tesla stock price is problematic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tesla lost $14 million in valuation hours after co-founder and CEO Elon Musk Friday tweeted, “Tesla stock price is too high imo”. Musk personal stake too went down by about $3 billion following the tweet.
This is not the first time that Musk has given statements about his company through social media. In 2018, Musk tweeted he was thinking about taking the company private, which cost him his role as chairman. “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,” he tweeted in August 2018. After his tweet, Tesla’s stock price increased by more than 6 per cent and closed up at 10.98 per cent from the previous day. Recently, a federal judge said Musk and Tesla must face a lawsuit filed by the shareholders regarding this tweet.
How significant are such tweets?
While they are just tweets, their consequences raise questions if it is legal for CEOs of companies to share such information through their social media accounts.
In its 2018 complaint against Musk, the US Securities Exchange and Commission (SEC) referred to his comments as “false” and “misleading” and referred to him as “reckless”. As per an agreement between SEC and Musk, his tweets regarding the company’s finances and sales, etc. need to be vetted by a company lawyer.
“Musk’s statements, disseminated via Twitter, falsely indicated that, should he so choose, it was virtually certain that he could take Tesla private at a purchase price that reflected a substantial premium over Tesla stock’s then-current share price, that funding for this multi-billion dollar transaction had been secured, and that the only contingency was a shareholder vote. In truth and in fact, Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source,” SEC noted in its complaint.
In 2012, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was investigated by the SEC after he announced on social media that Netflix subscribers had surpassed 1 billion hours of viewing time.
“Congrats to Ted Sarandos, and his amazing content licensing team. Netflix monthly viewing exceeded 1 billion hours for the first time ever in June. When House of Cards and Arrested Development debut, we’ll blow these records away. Keep going, Ted, we need even more!” Hastings said in July 2012.

So then, are CEOs allowed to make such announcements through social media?
Following their investigation of Hastings’s comments, the SEC came to the conclusion that companies could use social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter to announce key information as long as investors have been alerted about where to look for company-related updates and announcements.
In a report prepared by SEC into the investigation, the body noted that prior to Hastings’s comment, he had not received information from the company’s chief financial officer (CFO), the legal department or investor relations department. “Netflix’s stock continued a rise that began when the market opened on July 3, increasing from $70.45 at the time of Hastings’s Facebook post to $81.72 at the close of the following trading day,” the report said.
Essentially, the investigation into his post raised questions regarding the application of Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD) to his post and the applicability of the Commission’s August 2008 Guidance on the Use of Company Web Sites to emerging technologies including social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Regulation FD was adopted to check if issuers were selectively disclosing important non-public information to security analysts and selected institutional investors before making full disclosure of the same information.
Regulation FD and the Exchange Act prohibit public companies or persons acting on their behalf “from selectively disclosing material, nonpublic information to certain securities professionals, or shareholders where it is reasonably foreseeable that they will trade on that information, before it is made available to the general public”.
In conclusion, the SEC does not discourage the use of social media by companies or people who represent them to communicate information as long as investors know about these channels of communication.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk's bizarre tweet wipes $14 billion off Tesla market value in hours</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Elon Musk may lose his job as Tesla chief execuive as the carmaker's board, as well as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), must have taken into account his bizarre tweet that brought Tesla's market value down by $14 billion in hours.
The tweet saying that Tesla stock was "too high" also knocked $3 billion off Musk's own stake in the electric carmaker.
His earlier notorious tweet in August 2018 — when he posted about Tesla "going private, funding secured" at $420 a share — cost him his role as chairman.

The August 2018 tweet resulted in Musk and Tesla reaching a settlement of fraud charges with the SEC. The settlement included $40 million in penalties, split equally between the company and Musk, and the removal of Musk as chairman of the Tesla board.
"As a result of the settlement, Elon Musk will no longer be Chairman of Tesla, Tesla's board will adopt important reforms -- including an obligation to oversee Musk's communications with investors -- and both will pay financial penalties," Steven Peikin, Co-Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said in a statement.
According to the SEC's complaint, Musk's misleading tweets caused Tesla's stock price to jump by over six percent on August 7, and led to significant market disruption.

On Friday, Musk again stirred the controversy by tweeting that "Tesla stock price is too high imo (in my opinion)".
Tesla's market valuation was worth around $141 billion before the first tweet and it nosedived to nearly $127 billion. One user replied to Musk: "Are you doing it because you need the cash or is this to protest the world burning down?"
Musk replied: "Don't need the cash. Devoting myself to Mars and Earth. Possession just weigh you down".
Musk is supposed to seek pre-approval if his tweets include anything regarding the company's securities, including his acquisition or disposition of shares, nonpublic legal or regulatory findings or decisions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bizarre Elon Musk tweets wipe almost €12bn off Tesla's share price</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">About US$13bn (€11.7bn) was wiped off Tesla's shares after chief executive Elon Musk tweeted that the electric car company's "stock price is too high".
In a series of other tweets, Mr Musk (48) also said he was "selling almost all physical possessions" and "will own no house".
He added his girlfriend was "mad at me".
The subsequent 9% drop in Tesla share prices erased about US$3bn (€2.7bn) from Mr Musk's own stake.
Nevertheless, they remain almost 50% up from the start of April.
The Wall Street Journal said Mr Musk responded to an e-mail asking whether he was joking, or whether his tweet was vetted, by saying: "No."
It is not the first time Mr Musk has sent provocative tweets.
In April 2019, he posted: "My Twitter is pretty much complete nonsense at this point."
In August 2018, he tweeted that he had secured funding to possibly take Tesla private.
It led to a fraud case by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which Mr Musk settled by agreeing to pay US$20m (€18.1m) and have a Tesla lawyer pre-screen tweets with important information about the company.
The latest posts on social media are not the only controversy Mr Musk has found himself in this week.
He described coronavirus lockdowns as "forcibly imprisoning people in their homes" and "fascist".
Mr Musk said he did not know when Tesla could resume production in California - and called the state's stay-at-home order a "serious risk" to the business.
He added: "To say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist.
"This is not democratic, this is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom!"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla's Stock Drops Billions After Elon Musk's Tweetstorm Friday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Friday Techcrunch reported Elon Musk tweeted to his 33.4 million followers that Tesla's stock price "was 'too high' in his opinion, immediately sending shares into a free fall and in possible violation of an agreement reached with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last year." Tesla's shares plummetted nearly 12% over the next 30 minutes, which reduced Tesla's valuation by over $14 billion, the BBC reports, while reducing Musk's own stake by $3 billion, according to an article shared by long-time Slashdot reader UnresolvedExternal. "In other tweets, he said his girlfriend was mad at him, while another simply read: 'Rage, rage against the dying of the light of consciousness.'"Even at the end of the day Tesla's shares were still down 7.17%. But Techcrunch called Musk's stock-price tweet "just one of many sent out in rapid fire that covered everything from demands to 'give people back their freedom' and lines from the U.S. National Anthem to quotes from poet Dylan Thomas and a claim that he will sell all of his possessions."Rolling Stone has more on what they're calling Musk's "quarantine tantrum," noting that in a Wednesday earnings call, Musk had also complained about restrictions on non-essential businesses and ordinary people. "To say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist... give people back their goddamn freedom." The magazine notes this drew a scathing rebuttal on nationwide TV from The Daily Show's Trevor Noah: "Finally, someone has decided to call out this fascist American government that's asking people to please stay in their houses to try and save their own lives," Noah said sarcastically. "I mean, you're not even allowed to go to the grocery store anymore! Well, actually, you can go to the grocery store, but you can't even go for a walk! I mean, you can do that too, but what about the beach? You're not allowed to go to the beach, except for all the states where you're allowed to go to the beach. But you definitely can't go to H&M, and that is the definition of fascism."CNN Business writes that Musk, "heralded for years as a pioneer in space travel and transportation, has recently veered into disseminating coronavirus misinformation," adding that Musk's comments "also come in stark contrast to those made by some of his peers in Silicon Valley, who have urged caution on reopening." "I worry that reopening certain places too quickly, before infection rates have been reduced to very minimal levels, will almost guarantee future outbreaks and worsen longer-term health and economic outcomes," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during an earnings call Wednesday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk says Tesla’s stock price is too high, and now it has fallen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Friday that Tesla’s stock price is “too high imo,” and the stock fell immediately after. Tesla’s stock is down more than 10 percent.
Last year, Musk made an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to have a company lawyer pre-approve tweets about Tesla’s finances, sales, or deliveries last April. The settlement exists because Musk tweeted he was thinking of taking Tesla private, “funding secured.” The SEC sued him for securities fraud as a result.
Here is Musk’s entire tweet:
On February 19th of last year, Musk tweeted that Tesla would make “around” 500,000 Tesla Model 3s in 2019, which was not in line with the company’s guidance at that time. The SEC then asked Musk if he was complying with the order to have his tweets reviewed. It turned out that he wasn’t, which led to a weeks-long legal battle for a stricter settlement agreed upon in April 2019. Tesla and Musk are still defending themselves from shareholder lawsuits stemming from the go private tweets.
When asked by The Wall Street Journal if he was joking in today’s tweet about Tesla’s stock price or if the tweet had been vetted, Musk only replied “No” in an email.
Musk followed today’s tweet about the stock price being too high by tweeting the lyrics to “The Star-Spangled Banner,” America’s national anthem. This also has echoes of his response to the SEC: he’s called the agency’s response to his February 19th tweets “an unconstitutional power grab.”
Update May 1st, 1:57PM ET: Added comment from Musk obtained by The Wall Street Journal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">IMF approves emergency loan for Ecuador</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The International Monetary Fund has approved a $643 million emergency loan for Ecuador, as the coronavirus pandemic and low oil prices hit the South American nation.
The Ecuadorian Ministry of Economy and Finance said Friday the five-year loan came with "favorable conditions" at 1.05 percent interest.
The country faces a double crisis in the form of the virus and a fall in oil prices, with the IMF forecasting a drop of 6.3 percent in the country's GDP in 2020.
Ecuador has so far reported more than 25,000 COVID-19 infections and 1,000 deaths linked to the disease.
"This financing will provide the necessary liquidity to support the reactivation of production and the protection of jobs," the ministry said in a statement.
The credit offering joins a three-year economic assistance program signed by Lenin Moreno's government with the international body in 2019.
That $4.2 billion loan involved a raft of cuts and fiscal adjustments that led to a wave of protests in October 2019 when the government raised fuel prices.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The International Monetary Fund will provide Ecuador with a $643 million loan to combat the novel coronavirus outbreak, the nation's Ministry of Economy and Finance said on Friday.
According to the Ministry, the IMF loan has been granted for 5 years and has an interest rate of 1.05%. 
On 1 May, the International Monetary Fund approved a two-year $10.8 billion credit line for Colombia under the Flexible Credit Line.
In April, it approved $389 million in emergency funding for El-Salvador to help cushion the nation’s economy from the impact of nationwide restrictions on transportation and quarantine for citizens exposed to the coronavirus.
Previously, the IMF said it was providing some $100 billion as a short-term liquidity line to more than 100 countries requiring emergency financing due to hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NBCUniversal weighs layoffs at media, entertainment units: WSJ</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) owned NBCUniversal is evaluating a significant reduction of staff across its portfolio of media and entertainment properties as part of a cost-cutting effort, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Discussions began this week regarding cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, according to the report.
Along with its industry peers, NBCUniversal is taking a financial hit from the coronavirus outbreak which has shuttered movie theaters and theme parks. The company has temporarily closed its theme parks and suspended its sports productions and most of its film and TV production.
Although all divisions are being looked at, some areas likely to be under a microscope at NBCUniversal are the theme-parks division and Universal Pictures, the WSJ reported.
NBCUniversal declined to comment on the report.
The company, which reported its results earlier this week, said its quarterly revenue at the filmed entertainment unit fell 22.5% this quarter from a year earlier, while revenue at theme parks fell 31.9%.
Last month, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said it will start furloughs of non-essential U.S. employees across the company.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Climate activists claim win as JPMorgan sets timetable for new lead director</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - New York City’s pension fund leader claimed a win on Friday after JPMorgan Chase & Co set a timetable to replace its lead independent director, a former Exxon Mobil Corp CEO who had become the focus of criticism of the bank’s climate record.
The director, Lee Raymond, who is up for re-election at the bank’s annual meeting on May 19, had earlier asked the board to start a formal process to find a successor for the lead independent director role, JPMorgan said previously.
But in a securities filing on Thursday JPMorgan said it plans to name a new lead independent director “by end of summer 2020.” A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment beyond the language in the filings.
New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees the city’s pension fund and whose office last month began a campaign to vote out Raymond, in a statement sent by a spokeswoman called the change “a tremendous victory for shareholders and for the planet.”
Stringer’s office in its campaign against Raymond had cited JPMorgan’s lending to fossil fuel companies and Raymond’s long tenure on JPMorgan’s board.
Raymond has been on the board of JPMorgan and a predecessor since 1987.
Institutional Shareholder Services on Thursday had recommended investors back all JPMorgan directors, but called its support for Raymond “cautionary” in order “to convey that additional, new independent oversight is necessary as the process to find his successor unfolds.”[nL1N2CJ03L]

    <h5 class="mb-1">A decade after debt crisis, Greece on verge of virus recession</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ten years after sinking into its worst economic crisis in living memory, Greece once again faces the spectre of a grave recession in the midst of a global coronavirus lockdown.
Though the country has so far been spared the death toll of other European nations at fewer than 150 fatalities from COVID-19, it will not escape the resulting economic downturn, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis warned this week.
"The consequences of this coronavirus attack will undoubtedly be dramatic," he told parliament on Thursday.
"We know with certainty that (the recession) will be deep... we don't know how long the health crisis will last, we don't yet know if we'll have tourism."
Tourism is one of Greece's most important sources of revenue, along with shipping.
The Greek state alone could lose 8-10 billion euros ($8.8-11 billion) in income this year, the prime minister said.
- Where's the money? -
Greece has already adopted measures worth 17.5 billion euros, or 10 percent of national output, to support businesses and employees, Mitsotakis said.
Including EU funds, the package will reach 24 billion euros, he said.
But the opposition has questioned whether the money has actually reached the intended recipients.
"Where is this money? It's good for announcements but actual businesses and (employees) have not received a single euro," former leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras said Thursday, predicting that layoffs will soon be "out of control".
Greece this year had been counting on a growth spurt of 2.4 percent. After exiting the final debt crisis bailout in 2018, its borrowing rates were at historic lows -- in October Athens even sold treasury bills at a negative rate -- and it has cash reserves of more than 36 billion euros at hand.
But with most of its economy in virus quarantine since March and global lockdowns expected to wreak havoc on tourism, Greece is expected to sink into a 10 percent recession this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
- 'Irreparable' damage -
Panagiotis Petrakis, professor of finance at the University of Athens, argued that the economic blow will be less severe.
"The most likely scenario is a six percent contraction, provided there is no deterioration in the pandemic," he told AFP.
Petrakis also believes that the economic impact of this crisis will be less protracted. The IMF itself estimates a 5.5 percent Greek recovery in 2021.
The Greek finance ministry says the downturn could be limited to 4.7 percent through support measures, followed by a 5.1 percent rebound. The jobless rate will approach 20 percent, it said Friday.
The government will begin easing lockdown restrictions this month, with most shops opening by May 11 and restaurants and year-round hotels following on June 1.
But few expect any foreign visitors before July.
Many Greek businesses fear the damage will be irreparable, especially with minimum two-metre (6.5-feet) social distancing requirements squeezing out customers.
"Last summer I had 10 tables outside and 10 inside. Now, I will just have three tables outside and I'm supposed to make do," says Costas Gogos, owner of a tavern in the port of Rafina near Athens.
"Many will not even reopen, they won't manage with so few tables," added a neighbouring restaurant owner.
- Memories of 2010 -
It was on May 2, 2010, when the socialist government of George Papandreou signed the first of three eventual bailouts with the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF that would total 350 billion euros.
A week earlier, Papandreou had stunned the nation by announcing the call for international assistance. His televised address from the tiny island of Kastelorizo is indelibly etched in the nation's collective memory.
In the years that followed, a quarter of Greek national output would be wiped out in wave upon wave of wage and pension cuts and tax hikes demanded by the so-called troika of creditors.
Unemployment soared to a high of 27 percent before eventually falling to 16 percent in March, still the highest in the eurozone.
Dozens of general strikes and hundreds of street protests would follow, many of them violent. In one of the worst incidents on May 5, 2010, three people died in a bank set on fire during an anti-austerity protest, one of them a pregnant woman. The culprits were never caught.
The crisis was sparked by reckless state spending and misreporting of fiscal data to the EU. When revealed by Papandreou's government, it caused Greece's borrowing rates to spike beyond reach.

The government will begin easing lockdown restrictions this month, with most shops opening by May 11 and restaurants and year-round hotels following on June 1.
But few expect any foreign visitors before July.
Many Greek businesses fear the damage will be irreparable, especially with minimum two-metre (6.5-feet) social distancing requirements squeezing out customers.
"Last summer I had 10 tables outside and 10 inside. Now, I will just have three tables outside and I'm supposed to make do," says Costas Gogos, owner of a tavern in the port of Rafina near Athens.
"Many will not even reopen, they won't manage with so few tables," added a neighbouring restaurant owner.
It was on May 2, 2010, when the socialist government of George Papandreou signed the first of three eventual bailouts with the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF that would total 350 billion euros.
A week earlier, Papandreou had stunned the nation by announcing the call for international assistance. His televised address from the tiny island of Kastelorizo is indelibly etched in the nation's collective memory.
In the years that followed, a quarter of Greek national output would be wiped out in wave upon wave of wage and pension cuts and tax hikes demanded by the so-called troika of creditors.
Unemployment soared to a high of 27 percent before eventually falling to 16 percent in March, still the highest in the eurozone.
Dozens of general strikes and hundreds of street protests would follow, many of them violent. In one of the worst incidents on May 5, 2010, three people died in a bank set on fire during an anti-austerity protest, one of them a pregnant woman. The culprits were never caught.
The crisis was sparked by reckless state spending and misreporting of fiscal data to the EU. When revealed by Papandreou's government, it caused Greece's borrowing rates to spike beyond reach.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A decade after debt crisis, Greece on verge of virus recession</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ATHENS, May 2 — Ten years after sinking into its worst economic crisis in living memory, Greece once again faces the spectre of a grave recession in the midst of a global coronavirus lockdown.
Though the country has so far been spared the death toll of other European nations at fewer than 150 fatalities from Covid-19, it will not escape the resulting economic downturn, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis warned this week.
“The consequences of this coronavirus attack will undoubtedly be dramatic,” he told parliament on Thursday.
“We know with certainty that (the recession) will be deep... we don’t know how long the health crisis will last, we don’t yet know if we’ll have tourism.”
Tourism is one of Greece’s most important sources of revenue, along with shipping.
The Greek state alone could lose €8-10 billion (RM38.1-47.6 billion) in income this year, the prime minister said.
Where’s the money?
Greece has already adopted measures worth €17.5 billion, or 10 per cent of national output, to support businesses and employees, Mitsotakis said.
Including EU funds, the package will reach €24 billion, he said.
But the opposition has questioned whether the money has actually reached the intended recipients.
“Where is this money? It’s good for announcements but actual businesses and (employees) have not received a single euro,” former leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras said Thursday, predicting that layoffs will soon be “out of control”.
Greece this year had been counting on a growth spurt of 2.4 per cent. After exiting the final debt crisis bailout in 2018, its borrowing rates were at historic lows — in October Athens even sold treasury bills at a negative rate — and it has cash reserves of more than €36 billion at hand.
But with most of its economy in virus quarantine since March and global lockdowns expected to wreak havoc on tourism, Greece is expected to sink into a 10 per cent recession this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
‘Irreparable’ damage
Panagiotis Petrakis, professor of finance at the University of Athens, argued that the economic blow will be less severe.
“The most likely scenario is a six per cent contraction, provided there is no deterioration in the pandemic,” he told AFP.
Petrakis also believes that the economic impact of this crisis will be less protracted. The IMF itself estimates a 5.5 per cent Greek recovery in 2021.
The Greek finance ministry says the downturn could be limited to 4.7 per cent through support measures, followed by a 5.1 per cent rebound. The jobless rate will approach 20 per cent, it said yesterday.
The government will begin easing lockdown restrictions this month, with most shops opening by May 11 and restaurants and year-round hotels following on June 1.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Boeing went from appealing for government aid to snubbing it</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In just six weeks, Boeing Co (BA.N) went from seeking government aid to announcing it no longer needed it.
The company’s $25 billion bond issue this week made all the difference.
The upsized deal, this year’s largest investment-grade bond issue and the sixth largest on record, surpassed Boeing’s expectations. It underscores how the Chicago-based company capitalized on U.S. government support, even without having to accept taxpayer money as aid.
On March 24, Boeing’s Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told Reuters in an interview that the credit markets were “essentially closed” to the largest U.S. plane maker, and that the entire U.S. aerospace industry urgently needed capital to cope with the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.
A $2.3 trillion U.S. stimulus package, enacted into law at the end of March to provide relief to the U.S. economy which was hit hard by the pandemic, subsequently carved out $17 billion in aid for Boeing and other companies critical to national security.
Boeing itself had lobbied extensively for aid and had called for at least $60 billion in government loans for the entire aerospace manufacturing sector. “We can’t let anything happen to Boeing,” U.S. President Donald Trump said last month, in one of the many instances he expressed support for the company.
Several bond investors in interviews with Reuters cited the U.S. government’s backstopping of Boeing, as well as the Federal Reserve’s support of the credit markets in the aftermath of the pandemic, as reasons for the success of the capital raise.
“Boeing is pretty vital to, not just the U.S. economy, but to national security interests. Also, you can’t argue (with the fact that) the Fed support is what has been the primary driver of what is allowing risk assets to boom,” said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management.
Already saddled with $39 billion in debt as of the end of March, Boeing started the week searching for cash, to cope not just with impact of the coronavirus outbreak on air travel, but with the long grounding of its flagship 737 Max aircraft as well, following a string of accidents.
Smith and Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun had taken what they called a “balanced” approach, reiterating on Wednesday that they were exploring a mix of government aid and commercial funding.
One potential source of government aid, the $17 billion national security-related fund administered by the U.S. Treasury Department, came with significant strings, including the possibility of the U.S. government getting a stake in Boeing. That could have led to Boeing’s shareholders getting diluted.
Then Boeing had a breakthrough. Its plan was to gauge investor interest for a bond issue of between $10 billion and $15 billion, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Yet demand for the bonds on Thursday peaked at more than $70 billion from over 600 investor accounts, according to the sources.
Credit rating agencies told Boeing it could borrow as much as $25 billion through a bond issue and just about retain its investment-grade rating, according to the sources.
This was important for Boeing, to reign in its borrowing costs and attract more investors to the bond offering, the sources said. Investors that traditionally invest in junk-rated debt, such as hedge funds, also flocked to Boeing’s bond issue, because it was priced at premium to investment-grade deals, according to the sources.
Boeing priced different bond tranches spanning several maturities at between 450 basis points and 593 basis points, whereas the average spread for bonds of Boeing’s credit rating is 306 basis points, according to ICE BofA Data.
“Let’s face it, Boeing is not an investment-grade company by any stretch of the imagination,” said Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds at Janus Henderson Investors.
Boeing declined to comment on its internal planning for the capital raise.
But Boeing announced on Thursday that as a result of the strong response to its bond offering, it did “not plan to seek additional funding through the capital markets or the U.S. government options at this time.”
Boeing had to make concessions to cajole the credit rating agencies and bond investors. It agreed to increase interest payments by 25 basis points each time the two biggest credit rating agencies lowered its rating by one level into junk, according to the bond issue’s prospectus. It capped these concessions at 100 basis points per credit-rating agency and 200 basis points in total.
Boeing expects the money from the bond issue to cover its funding needs for the year, barring any unexpected event. Before announcing it would no longer seek government aid, it stress-tested its financial assumptions and considered numerous scenarios to ensure it has liquidity for the remainder of the year, according to the sources.
Boeing has also had to take several cost-cutting measures, including announcing plans to shed about 16,000 jobs this year, about 10% of its workforce, through early retirements and likely layoffs.
On Friday, Smith told Boeing employees in a message he wanted “to thank the administration for the actions they have taken to support our economy and the credit markets.”

Several bond investors in interviews with Reuters cited the U.S. government's backstopping of Boeing, as well as the Federal Reserve's support of the credit markets in the aftermath of the pandemic, as reasons for the success of the capital raise.
"Boeing is pretty vital to, not just the U.S. economy, but to national security interests. Also, you can't argue (with the fact that) the Fed support is what has been the primary driver of what is allowing risk assets to boom," said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management.
Already saddled with US$39 billion in debt as of the end of March, Boeing started the week searching for cash, to cope not just with impact of the coronavirus outbreak on air travel, but with the long grounding of its flagship 737 Max aircraft as well, following a string of accidents.
Smith and Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun had taken what they called a "balanced" approach, reiterating on Wednesday that they were exploring a mix of government aid and commercial funding.
One potential source of government aid, the US$17 billion national security-related fund administered by the U.S. Treasury Department, came with significant strings, including the possibility of the U.S. government getting a stake in Boeing. That could have led to Boeing's shareholders getting diluted.
Then Boeing had a breakthrough. Its plan was to gauge investor interest for a bond issue of between US$10 billion and US$15 billion, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Yet demand for the bonds on Thursday peaked at more than US$70 billion from over 600 investor accounts, according to the sources.
Credit rating agencies told Boeing it could borrow as much as US$25 billion through a bond issue and just about retain its investment-grade rating, according to the sources.
This was important for Boeing, to reign in its borrowing costs and attract more investors to the bond offering, the sources said. Investors that traditionally invest in junk-rated debt, such as hedge funds, also flocked to Boeing's bond issue, because it was priced at premium to investment-grade deals, according to the sources.
Boeing priced different bond tranches spanning several maturities at between 450 basis points and 593 basis points, whereas the average spread for bonds of Boeing's credit rating is 306 basis points, according to ICE BofA Data.
"Let's face it, Boeing is not an investment-grade company by any stretch of the imagination," said Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds at Janus Henderson Investors.
Boeing declined to comment on its internal planning for the capital raise.
But Boeing announced on Thursday that as a result of the strong response to its bond offering, it did "not plan to seek additional funding through the capital markets or the U.S. government options at this time."
CONCESSIONS
Boeing had to make concessions to cajole the credit rating agencies and bond investors. It agreed to increase interest payments by 25 basis points each time the two biggest credit rating agencies lowered its rating by one level into junk, according to the bond issue's prospectus. It capped these concessions at 100 basis points per credit-rating agency and 200 basis points in total.
Boeing expects the money from the bond issue to cover its funding needs for the year, barring any unexpected event. Before announcing it would no longer seek government aid, it stress-tested its financial assumptions and considered numerous scenarios to ensure it has liquidity for the remainder of the year, according to the sources.
Boeing has also had to take several cost-cutting measures, including announcing plans to shed about 16,000 jobs this year, about 10per cent of its workforce, through early retirements and likely layoffs.
On Friday, Smith told Boeing employees in a message he wanted "to thank the administration for the actions they have taken to support our economy and the credit markets."

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Boeing went from appealing for government aid to snubbing it</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK/WASHINGTON — In just six weeks, Boeing Co went from seeking government aid to announcing it no longer needed it.
The company’s $25 billion bond issue this week made all the difference.
The upsized deal, this year’s largest investment-grade bond issue and the sixth largest on record, surpassed Boeing’s expectations. It underscores how the Chicago-based company capitalized on U.S. government support, even without having to accept taxpayer money as aid.
On March 24, Boeing’s Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told Reuters in an interview that the credit markets were “essentially closed” to the largest U.S. plane maker, and that the entire U.S. aerospace industry urgently needed capital to cope with the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.
A $2.3 trillion U.S. stimulus package, enacted into law at the end of March to provide relief to the U.S. economy which was hit hard by the pandemic, subsequently carved out $17 billion in aid for Boeing and other companies critical to national security.
Boeing itself had lobbied extensively for aid and had called for at least $60 billion in government loans for the entire aerospace manufacturing sector. “We can’t let anything happen to Boeing,” U.S. President Donald Trump said last month, in one of the many instances he expressed support for the company.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Finance minister asks banks to consider abolishing accrued interest on hire purchase loans, profits on fixed-rate Islamic financing during moratorium</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, May 2 — Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz today requested that financial institutions consider abolishing the accrued interest on hire purchase (HP) loans, as well as profit from their fixed-rate Islamic financing, during the six-month moratorium period on loan repayments.
Taking to his Facebook page today, Zafrul said that though there are many banks that offer loan deferment without imposing the accrued or compounded interest, the leeway does not cover all loan products.
“Each bank, meanwhile, sets its own approach on matters related to interest imposition, during the moratorium.
“Taking into cognisance that there is a possibility that it can be implemented, and taking the people’s request into account, I would like to suggest that all financial institutions, especially those involved in this moratorium, to consider abolishing the accrued interest for hire purchase loans or profits for fixed-rate Islamic financing, for this six-month moratorium period,” Zafrul said.
He added that although the final say in the matter lies with Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), however, has begun taking proactive steps to seek a solution to the issue, via discussions with BNM and banks, in the interests of the people.
“Given the challenging economic conditions caused by the Covid-19 outbreak, I sincerely hope that this view can be given due consideration by BNM and other financial institutions in the country. I believe this move will have a positive impact on our people,” he added.
BNM yesterday said that it regrets the “confusion and anxiety” stemming from its announcement on changes to the six-month moratorium for HP loans and fixed-rate Islamic financing, on March 30.
In a newly released frequently asked questions (FAQs) list yesterday, the central bank denied that it had also backpedalled on its initial announcement.
In its explainer, BNM stressed that the payment deferment is still automatic for HP and fixed rate Islamic financing, adding that what is required now is an additional step to comply with procedural requirements under the Hire-Purchase Act 1967 (HP Act) and Shariah.
“This additional step is unavoidable, and is required to incorporate the changes to the payment schedule and/or amounts as a result of the six-month payment deferment in loan/financing agreements.
“We sincerely regret any confusion and anxiety that this announcement may have caused. The deferment of loan repayments is meant to ease cash flows for borrowers/customers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. This intent remains the same. The confusion arises because of the misperception that the repayment amounts for a HP loan cannot be changed,” it said.
BNM added that the misperception arose, due to an illustration provided in an initial version of the FAQs, “where certain assumptions and caveats were made.”
It said that it had later removed the example when banks provided their own illustrations.
BNM then provided an example of a RM50,000 HP loan with a remaining tenure of five years and a fixed interest of 2.71 per cent (or an effective rate of 5.36 per cent) per annum:
Before the deferment, the monthly instalment was RM712.
But should the deferment option be accepted, based on this example, the monthly instalment is now RM731, or an increase by 2 per cent or RM19. Consequently, the total interest increase incurred is RM1,130.      
Several reports emerged on the evening of April 30, citing a BNM press release, on a purported reversal from what was initially announced with regards to the interest payable on the deferred HP loans and profit on fixed-rate Islamic financing.
Financial website, Ringgit Plus, reported that the press release had “hinted of a big change that will affect millions of Malaysians currently servicing car loans or Islamic financing.”
The report, which was one of those widely shared by those angered by the announcement, reported that BNM had also implied that from May 1, 2020, the six-month moratorium will also no longer be an automatic opt-in for all customers.
Ringgit Plus reported that the press release further stated that BNM required that all borrowers “are provided with clear information on the process and changes to the terms of their agreements”, and that the banking institutions provide borrowers with “necessary steps that they need to take to complete the process of deferring their loan/financing payments”.
This was seen as a departure from what was announced initially, where customers are only asked to opt-out of the deferment, should they want to continue servicing their loans with their banks, as otherwise, banks would grant an automatic deferment.
BNM later said that any additional interest that some banks may charge on the deferred payment cannot be higher than the original hire-purchase contract signed.
The central bank reiterated that, as a regulator, it has from the very beginning, already indicated that there will be accrued interest or profit with regard to the six-month moratorium.
The announcement also saw social media users targeting Zafrul with criticisms coupled with the hashtag #bankerjagabanker.
The confusion further escalated and caused widespread anger; which even led to the start of an online petition denouncing the move by BNM and demanding for zero per cent interest on the deferred instalment payments.
Last month, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced the government’s move to freeze loan repayments for six months due to the coronavirus disease, which he said will provide relief worth RM100 billion to Malaysians.
The prime minister said the unprecedented move BNM announced on March 24, was the government’s response to public concern about hardships they are enduring due to the movement control order (MCO).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Finance minister asks BNM and banks to reconsider charging interest on HP loans in 6-month moratorium</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Finance minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz has waded into the issue regarding banks charging interest on paused hire purchase (HP) loan payments (or profit from fixed-rate Islamic financing) in the government announced six-month moratorium to ease financial burden and improve cashflow in these difficult times.
Before we go into what the former top banker turned cabinet member said on his Facebook page, here’s a recap on the issue. This week, it was announced that HP loans (we’ll use the term to cover fixed-rate Islamic financing as well) will come with additional interest charges after the six-month moratorium effective from April 1 to September 30.
Basically, if you choose to take up the half-year payment pause, it won’t be interest free, and you’ll have to pay back the interest later. The confusion, and anger for some, is that many expected the six-month payment moratorium to incur no interest, just a pause and nothing else.
A Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) FAQ released on March 27 indicated that there would be no additional interest charged on HP loans. This mention regarding HP loans was subsequently dropped in an amended FAQ dated April 21, and mention of interest being charged emerged. Refer to the screenshots to compare.
Basically, there will no free lunch now, so to speak, but Tengku Zafrul is requesting the banks to consider abolishing the accrued interest for HP loans for the six months.
“Lately, there has been confusion regarding the interest or profit rate charged during the six-month moratorium scheme offered by banks. Among the causes of this confusion are various sources that delivered inaccurate information. With that, BNM on May 1 published an FAQ document that has been updated. BNM has also conducted a press conference to clarify the confusion faced by borrowers,” he said today on his Facebook page, translated into English here.
“For your information, there are indeed banks that offered loan moratoriums without charging accrued interest or compounded interest. However, it does not cover all loan products. Also, every bank has its own approach regarding charging interest in the moratorium period.
“Taking into account that there’s a possibility for it to be implemented, and after considering the rakyat’s request, I would like to suggest that all financial institutions, especially those involved in the moratorium, consider abolishing the accrued interest (for HP loans) or profit (for fixed-rate Islamic financing) for the six-month moratorium period,” he added.
The minister acknowledged that this matter is under the purview of BNM, but said that the finance ministry has started proactive steps to find a solution for the issue via discussions with BNM and the banks, to find the best solution for the people.
“We at the finance ministry are ready to work together with BNM and the banking sector to ensure the implementation of this call. The government is always sensitive towards the needs of the rakyat, especially those from the B40 and M40, and is taking this matter seriously. In such a challenging economic situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, I hope that this view will be given fair consideration by BNM and the financial institutions.
“I am confident that this move will bring positive impact to the rakyat,” he ended.
Yesterday, BNM released a statement acknowledging the public’s confusion. “We sincerely regret any confusion and anxiety that this announcement may have caused. The deferment of loan repayments is meant to ease cash flows for borrowers/customers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. This intent remains the same. The confusion arises because of the misperception that the repayment amounts for a HP loan cannot be changed,” BNM said.
The central bank added that the misperception came about due to an illustration provided in an initial version of its FAQ, “where certain assumptions and caveats were made.” BNM said that it had later removed the illustration when the banks provided their own.
Earlier, we’ve also seen a few banks confirm these “assumptions” of monthly instalments staying the same after the moratorium period, in both their own FAQs and official responses to customer queries. We were among those who reported this original scenario, based directly on the information available, which – at the time – was accurate.
Yesterday, BNM also released an example of a RM50,000 HP loan with a remaining tenure of five years, on a fixed interest of 2.71% per annum. The original monthly instalment was RM712. Should the borrower opt for the payment pause, the monthly instalment will be RM731 in October once the moratorium ends. This is an increase of 2%, or RM19 a month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The non-bailout: How the Fed saved Boeing without paying a dime</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Less than two months ago Boeing Co. went to Washington, hat in hand, asking for a $60 billion bailout for itself and its suppliers. The company, which had spent heavily on stock buybacks and was still reeling from the 737 Max disaster, was an unlikely candidate for government support.
Yet by urging the Federal Reserve to take unprecedented steps to bolster credit markets, the Trump administration ended up helping the plane maker more than any government handout could.
The Fed’s decision to use its near limitless balance sheet to purchase corporate bonds improved liquidity so much that it was a game changer for the company, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.
Ultimately, it allowed Boeing to raise $25 billion from private investors and withdraw its request for a government rescue, avoiding the restrictions that would have certainly been imposed.
Boeing’s decision underscores the extent the Fed’s policies rebuilt confidence in credit markets even though the central bank has yet to spend a single dollar on its corporate debt program.
“Many companies that would’ve had to come to the Fed have now been able to finance themselves privately since we announced the initial term sheet on these facilities,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said during a press conference on April 29, before Boeing’s bond sale. “There’s a tremendous amount of financing going on, and that’s a good thing.”
Two optionsJust weeks earlier, Boeing’s hunt for rescue financing had gotten off to an inauspicious start. Nikki Haley, President Donald Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations, resigned from the company’s board in protest. Other critics were quick to argue the government could better spend its funds.
Company executives were undeterred.
They considered two main avenues to raise the billions of dollars of cash they would need to weather the crushing loss of business stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.
The company would turn to the capital markets to start building a cash stockpile, and then either tap financing available from the Fed or obtain a loan from the Treasury Department through the CARES Act, the people said.
The main turning point came as Congress and the Trump administration set more than $2 trillion of stimulus into place in late March. That funding calmed markets by enabling the Fed to inject even more liquidity into the economy through several lending facilities that the Treasury backstopped.
Also crucial was a deal to shore up U.S. airlines, key Boeing customers. Governments around the globe have committed about $100 billion to keeping airlines afloat, providing assurance that there will be buyers for Boeing airplanes when the outbreak abates.
A further rally in credit markets since then convinced the company and its bankers that they could move quickly after the release of quarterly earnings on April 29.
Boeing entered Thursday hoping to raise between $10 billion and $15 billion by selling bonds with maturities stretching as far out as 40 years, the people said. As demand for the offering peaked at over $70 billion, company officials realized they didn’t need to look any further for funds, and set the final size of the deal at $25 billion, turning it into the largest U.S. corporate bond sale of the year and the sixth largest on record.
Most of the buyers were asset managers and insurance companies that typically dominate the market for high-grade bonds, though some hedge funds and other speculative-grade investors were lured by the relatively high yields offered, one of the people said.
For the first time, the company included provisions that will increase the interest rate paid if the credit ratings on the notes are lowered to junk. Boeing is currently rated BBB- by S&P Global Ratings — the lowest investment-grade ranking.
Constant contactA representative from Boeing referred Bloomberg to comments from Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith to employees this week in which he called the bond sale “a testament to the confidence the market has in our business, our people, and our future.” The company declined to comment further.
Boeing was never in imminent danger, and had $15.5 billion in cash at the end of March after it fully drew down a new term loan, a move that marked the beginning of a global dash for cash from companies affected by the virus.
But executives and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were deeply worried about the long-term damage to the company and airlines when the markets started to seize up in mid-March.
Mnuchin and his staff have been in almost constant contact over the past month with Boeing officials, particularly Smith, as they collectively sought to find a way through the crisis, one of the people familiar said. The talks are ongoing and Boeing is now concerned about shoring up critical suppliers who are under severe financial distress.
A Treasury Department spokesman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The bond market signaled its confidence in the long-term prospects of the aviation industry on Thursday. But while Boeing now has a nearly $50 billion war chest to survive the next few years, the company will still need to take painful measures. That includes paring 16,000 jobs to adjust to a smaller commercial airplane market, one of the people said.
Boeing hasn’t closed the door to seeking federal aid in the future, especially given the risk the pandemic may again cripple travel and economies later this year. In fact the company artfully worded its statement to leave that option open, saying it had raised the funds it needs “at this time.”

The Fed’s decision to use its near limitless balance sheet to purchase corporate bonds eased liquidity so much that it was a game changer for the company, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.
Ultimately, it allowed Boeing to raise $25 billion from private investors and withdraw its request for a government rescue, avoiding the restrictions that would have certainly been imposed.
Boeing’s decision underscores the extent the Fed’s policies rebuilt confidence in credit markets even though the central bank has yet to spend a single dollar on its corporate debt program.
“Many companies that would’ve had to come to the Fed have now been able to finance themselves privately since we announced the initial term sheet on these facilities,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said during a press conference on April 29, before Boeing’s bond sale. “There’s a tremendous amount of financing going on, and that’s a good thing.”
Two OptionsJust weeks earlier, Boeing’s hunt for rescue financing had gotten off to an inauspicious start. Nikki Haley, President Donald Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations, resigned from the company’s board in protest. Other critics were quick to argue the government could better spend its funds.
Company executives were undeterred.
They considered two main avenues to raise the billions of dollars of cash they would need to weather the crushing loss of business stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.
The company would turn to the capital markets to start building a cash stockpile, and then either tap financing available from the Fed or obtain a loan from the Treasury Department through the CARES Act, the people said.
The main turning point came as Congress and the Trump administration set more than $2 trillion of stimulus into place in late March. That funding calmed markets by enabling the Fed to inject even more liquidity into the economy through several lending facilities that the Treasury backstopped.
Also crucial was a deal to shore up U.S. airlines, key Boeing customers. Governments around the globe have committed about $100 billion to keeping airlines afloat, providing assurance that there will be buyers for Boeing airplanes when the outbreak abates.
A further rally in credit markets since then convinced the company and its bankers that they could move quickly after the release of quarterly earnings on April 29.
Boeing entered Thursday hoping to raise between $10 billion and $15 billion by selling bonds with maturities stretching as far out as 40 years, the people said. As demand for the offering peaked at over $70 billion, company officials realized they didn’t need to look any further for funds, and set the final size of the offering at $25 billion, turning it into the largest U.S. corporate bond sale of the year.
Constant Contact
A representative from Boeing referred Bloomberg to comments from Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith to employees this week in which he called the bond sale “a testament to the confidence the market has in our business, our people, and our future.” The company declined to comment further.
Boeing was never in imminent danger, and had $15.5 billion in cash at the end of March after it fully drew down a new term loan, a move that marked the beginning of a global dash for cash from companies affected by the virus.
But executives and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were deeply worried about the long-term damage to the company and airlines when the markets started to seize up in mid-March.
Mnuchin and his staff have been in almost constant contact over the past month with Boeing officials, particularly Smith, as they collectively sought to find a way through the crisis, one of the people familiar said. The talks are ongoing and Boeing is now concerned about shoring up critical suppliers who are under severe financial distress.
A Treasury Department spokesman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The bond market signaled its confidence in the long-term prospects of the aviation industry on Thursday. But while Boeing now has a nearly $50 billion war chest to survive the next few years, the company will still need to take painful measures. That includes paring 16,000 jobs to adjust to a smaller commercial airplane market, one of the people said.
Boeing hasn’t closed the door to seeking federal aid in the future, especially given the risk the pandemic may again cripple travel and economies later this year. In fact the company artfully worded its statement to leave that option open, saying it had raised the funds it needs “at this time.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rolls-Royce 'to cut up to 8,000 jobs' as coronavirus crisis hits airline industry</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rolls-Royce is set to cut up to 8,000 jobs as the coronavirus pandemic hits the aviation industry, reports say.
A source at the company, which has a base in Filton, said the major aerospace manufacturer will not make an official announcement until early June.
And it's also unclear how many job losses will be in UK, as the manufacturer employs a global workforce.
It comes after the company announced it was cutting all but essential activity at its UK aerospace sites, including its Bristol plant.
Plunging demand from the likes of Airbus and Boeing has led the giant to warn it plans to make its single biggest workforce reduction in 30 years, according to the Financial Times.
The British aero-engineering firm has begun work on a restructuring plan that would take a scythe to its workforce of some 52,000, insiders told the newspaper.

It comes after both British Airways and Ryanair announced plans to make major staff cut.
The government has offered support packages to UK businesses in hopes of saving jobs.
However Rolls-Royce has had to deal with an immediate collapse in demand in the civil aerospace arm of its business, according to the FT's insider.

That part of the business employs around 23,000 globally and is said to be worth half the company's £15.4billion revenue.
The newspaper reports that an announcement on a final figure for the job cuts is not expected before the end of May, when Rolls-Royce has said it will update staff on the plans.
Sources told the FT discussions have just begun with unions, and it is feared the cutbacks could be larger than job losses after 9/11, when the Rolls-Royce group cut 5,000 jobs.
“The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented,” the company said in a statement to the FT.
“We have taken swift action to increase our liquidity, dramatically reduce our spending in 2020, and strengthen our resilience in these exceptionally challenging times. But we will need to take further action.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rolls-Royce has this to say on its workforce after 'job losses' report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rolls-Royce has released a statement about its workforce following claims that it is set to make thousands of job cuts.
According to the Financial Times, the engineering giant is set to make up to 8,000 job cuts after aircraft makers Airbus and Boeing slashed production to cope with a fall in global air travel, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Rolls-Royce employs a global workforce in its civil aerospace engineering business, which is headquartered in Sinfin.
The major manufacturer has now released a statement saying it will provide "further details" on the impact of coronavirus on the size of its workforce before the end of this month.
A spokeswoman for Rolls-Royce said: "The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented.
"We have taken swift action to increase our liquidity, dramatically reduce our spending in 2020, and strengthen our resilience in these exceptionally challenging times. But we will need to take further action.
"We have to do this right, which means we are working closely with our employee and trade union representatives and then we will consult with everyone affected.
"We have promised to give our people further details of the impact of the current situation on the size of our workforce before the end of this month."
Derbyshire Live's sister site Business Live previously reported how Rolls-Royce was introducing a raft of cost-cutting measures to help the firm save £750 million due to the coronavirus crisis.
In a trading update released to the markets on April 6, the company said that it would be reducing the salary of its global workforce by at least 10%.
The salary of its senior managers and executive team were to take a cut of 20% for the rest of 2020, comprising a 10% reduction and a 10% referral in pay.
Rolls-Royce said it was also reducing discretionary costs, such as non-critical capital expenditure projects, consulting, professional fees and sub-contractor costs, ceasing all non-essential travel and postponing external recruitment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rolls-Royce considering cutting up to 15% of its workforce - source</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings (RR.L) is considering cutting up to 15% of its workforce, a source close to the company told Reuters, as customers cut production and airlines park planes due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The size of layoffs has been mentioned internally by senior management, but is by no means finalised and there is a lot of negotiation still to be done, the source added.
The company’s engines power Airbus SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co’s (BA.N) widebody jets and Rolls-Royce is paid by airlines based on how many hours its engines fly.
The Financial Times earlier reported Rolls-Royce was preparing to lay off up to 8,000 of its 52,000-strong workforce.
An announcement on the final figure is not expected before the end of May, when the company will update employees, according to the FT report. (on.ft.com/2VSaQfD)
Last month, Rolls-Royce scrapped its targets and final dividend to shore up its finances to cope with the virus outbreak.
The company’s Chief Executive Officer Warren East said in April Rolls-Royce would be looking at cutting cash expenditure, including salary costs across its global workforce by at least 10% this year.
Discussions with unions about the job cuts have just begun, the newspaper reported, citing sources.
The scale of job cuts is still likely to be larger than after 9/11 when the group cut 5,000 jobs and the vast majority of it is expected to hit the civil aerospace unit, the FT said.
While job losses are also expected in the unit’s operations in Singapore and Germany, Britain’s civil aerospace workforce is expected to bear the majority of the cuts, according to the report.
Unite, Britain’s largest trade union, did not comment in response to a query from Reuters.

An announcement on the final figure is not expected before the end of May, when the company will update employees, according to the FT report. (https://on.ft.com/2VSaQfD)
Last month, Rolls-Royce scrapped its targets and final dividend to shore up its finances to cope with the virus outbreak.
The company’s Chief Executive Officer Warren East said in April Rolls-Royce would be looking at cutting cash expenditure, including salary costs across its global workforce by at least 10% this year.
Discussions with unions about the job cuts have just begun, the newspaper reported, citing sources.
The scale of job cuts is still likely to be larger than after 9/11 when the group cut 5,000 jobs and the vast majority of it is expected to hit the civil aerospace unit, the FT said.
While job losses are also expected in the unit’s operations in Singapore and Germany, Britain’s civil aerospace workforce is expected to bear the majority of the cuts, according to the report.
Unite, Britain’s largest trade union, did not comment in response to a query from Reuters. (Reporting by Maria Ponnezhath and Shubham Kalia in Bengaluru; Editing by Vinay Dwivedi and Shounak Dasgupta)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Deal For 200 Boeing 737 MAXs Impacted If British Airways Closes London Gatwick Base</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">British Airways told staff it could close its London Gatwick base, raising questions about the 200 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft that the airline’s parent, IAG, signed a letter of intent to buy.
Gatwick was due to receive the first part of the MAX aircraft from IAG’s LOI placed last summer and still valid as of February, the group said.
Unlike airlines now deferring aircraft deliveries, IAG’s MAX aircraft are not due in the immediate future. IAG requested delivery slots between 2023-2027. That could see the MAX arrive after IAG expects markets to finally rebound from the coronavirus downturn.
IAG new narrowbody aircraft needed: 2023-2029 as of November 2019
IAG previously expected its airlines to need 215 narrowbody aircraft between 2023-2029.
The plan included flexibility as 62 of the deliveries would allow IAG to accelerate retirement of medium-life aircraft it did not necessarily need to withdraw. The capital expense of newer aircraft had to be weighed against the unit cost and environmental advantages.
Under the LOI for 200 MAX aircraft, the first batch were allocated to British Airways at London Gatwick. They cannot be transferred to British Airways’ larger base at Heathrow, which requires baggage be loaded via containers.
Baggage has to be loaded individually onto the 737 MAX, unlike the A320 that can accept containers. British Airways uses the A320 family at Heathrow.
IAG also provisionally allocated MAX aircraft to Vueling and said the group could deploy MAX aircraft to its other airlines. IAG did not disclose the exact number for Vueling or British Airways. But it is unclear if other IAG carriers could absorb the Gatwick-bound aircraft.
“We suspended our Gatwick flying schedule at the start of April and there is no certainty as to when or if these services can or will return,” said an internal British Airways memo and reported by local media.
British Airways publicly announced it was seeking “up to 12,000” job redundancies. Actual redundancies could be fewer depending on negotiations with unions, which British Airways said it was starting.
All 12,000 reductions would impact over a quarter of its workforce. Having even half of the 12,000 reductions would still leave British Airways with its smallest workforce in over 30 years.
British Airways operates around 140 A320 family aircraft and 22% of its A320 pilots are based at Gatwick, according to a separate recent memo from management to pilots. That suggests around 31 A320 aircraft are based at Gatwick.
The same post-coronavirus economic outlook that impacts the Gatwick base could also affect other IAG units and see them taper new aircraft delivery plans.
There are various fleet scenarios within IAG before considering greater complexity from Air Europa.
After IAG’s LOI for the MAX aircraft, it announced plans to purchase Air Europa. The Spanish carrier was due to receive 25 737 MAX aircraft from 2020 to 2025.
Air Europa and IAG 737 MAX fleet plan, as of November 2019
IAG is reportedly re-negotiating the Air Europa purchase, but if it goes ahead IAG’s group fleet will have 737 MAX aircraft.
That could be an argument to proceed with the Boeing 737 MAX LOI and increase scale on the 737 MAX fleet inherited from Air Europe.
Or the LOI could lapse, but it may be too good to pass up.
Financial terms of IAG’s LOI with Boeing are not disclosed, but it is widely expected IAG received higher than normal discounts and flexibility. IAG was the first blue-chip customer to do a deal for the MAX after the type’s grounding in March 2019.
Boeing also won over IAG, which earlier replaced 737 classics with A320s and not 737 NGs. Airframers especially prize “flipping” customers from a competitor supplier.
IAG also saw value in ending sole sourcing of short-haul aircraft from Airbus.
“One of the key factors for us in the 737 MAX is not only getting a good price, but it is also making sure that the supply is being competed over both Airbus and Boeing,” IAG CFO Steve Gunning said last November. “In a world where you have a duopoly and you convert it into a monopoly because you do not deal with both [Airbus and Boeing] on the short-haul aircraft, that does not seem strategically to make sense.”
IAG will eventually need new aircraft. The question is if IAG wants to spend capital in the medium-term on a good deal. Consumer advice may hold. A sale is not a sale unless you wanted the item in the first place.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wall Street notches best monthly gains in decades</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York: Wall Street's major averages finished the last day of April on a downbeat note, but notched considerable gains for the month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 288.14 points, or 1.17 per cent, to end at 24,345.72 on Thursday. The S&P 500 was down 27.08 points, or 0.92 per cent, to 2,912.43. The Nasdaq Composite Index decreased 25.16 points, or 0.28 per cent, to 8,889.55.For the month, the Dow gained 11.1 per cent, while the S&P 500 ended April up 12.7 per cent, representing their best monthly performances since 1987, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Nasdaq posted a monthly gain of 15.5 per cent, its best such advance since 2000.The solid monthly gains came despite more data showed the COVID-19 fallout continues to ripple through the country.
About 3.84 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the week ending April 25, bringing the total number of claimants in the past six weeks to 30 million due to the coronavirus crisis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Thursday.US personal income fell 2 per cent in March and personal consumption expenditures plunged a record 7.5 per cent last month, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Thursday.The gloomy data came one day after the Commerce Department reported that US real gross domestic product in the first quarter contracted at an annual rate of 4.8 per cent, the biggest quarterly decline since the 2008 financial crisis.Increased stimulus efforts to protect the pandemic-battered economy and hopes for gradually easing restrictions on businesses helped bolster sentiment, experts noted.Stressing multiple risks from COVID-19, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday vowed to "use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."The Fed also expects to maintain its benchmark interest rate at the record-low level of near zero "until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals."The US central bank has already taken a range of extraordinary actions to mitigate the virus-tied damage, including slashing interest rates and launching unlimited quantitative easing."The Fed acknowledged the economic hammer blow from the coronavirus and policies implemented to protect against its transmission," Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial, said in a note.This is mainly a crisis for fiscal policy rather than central bank policy, but low rate expectations may assist in the economic recovery phase, said analysts at UBS.Investors also weighed the possibility of normalising economic activities as some US states mulled plans for reopening.Sentiment also started to brighten on energy markets by month-end.The West Texas Intermediate for June delivery soared 25.1 per cent to settle at 18.84 dollars a barrel, following a 22 per cent jump in the previous session. For the month, prices still lost 8 per cent, from the front-month contract settlement on March 31, according to Dow Jones Market Data.The now-defunct May contract for US benchmark settled in negative territory on April 20, marking the first time an oil futures contract had traded negative in history.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dow closes 600 points lower to wipe out weekly gains after Trump threatens China tariffs, earnings disappoint</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Stocks closed sharply lower Friday in an ugly start to the month of May as investors showed disappointment with earnings from big tech companies and with President Donald Trump’s threat to impose import tariffs on China in retaliation for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.55% fell 622.03 points, or 2.6%, to end at 23,723.69, while the S&P 500 SPX, -2.80% gave up 81.72 points, or 2.8%, to settle at 2,830.71. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.20% retreated 284.60 points, or 3.2%, closing at 8,604.95. NQ00, -0.18%
After gains Monday through Wednesday that helped the major indexes post their best April in years, losing sessions Thursday and Friday left the benchmarks with losses on the week, with the Dow and S&P losing 0.2% and the Nasdaq ending the week 0.3% lower.
U.S. stocks posted sharp losses as investors reevaluated the corporate earnings picture and the economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, after the major benchmarks notched their best monthly performances in years in April.
“After one of the best months in history, it’s not overly surprising to see some profit taking here,” said Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management in an interview.
“We started off earnings season on fire — there was a big start to the tech results and last night it was more mixed,” he added. “Markets were pricing in near perfection from the tech giants and now we’re seeing some downward pressure on the market as there’s a bit more realistic view of these results.”
Analysts said it was the guidance — or lack thereof in the case of Apple — that appeared to unsettle investors. Apple reported that profits slipped slightly but sales grew amid the spread of COVID-19, while promising investors billions more in stock repurchases and dividends, but declined to provide an outlook. Shares of Dow component Apple Inc.AAPL, -1.61% closed 1.6% lower Friday.
Shares of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -7.59%. , the second-largest company by market capitalization in the S&P 500, ended the session down 7.6% after it said late Thursday it topped $75 billion in sales in the first quarter as COVID-19 swept across the globe, but profit declined and the company said it might lose money in the current period as it spends to keep up with demand.
Both Apple and  Amazon are among the companies that led the S&P 500 index’s comeback from the March 23 lows and were two of the best performers in April. Amazon rallied nearly 27% in April while Apple jumped 15%.
The magnitude of the rebound from the market’s March 23 lows also has left valuations at very high levels during a time when the ongoing coronavirus epidemic makes forecasting future corporate profits difficult. The S&P 500 ended Friday with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 19.8, well above historical averages, according to FactSet.
Meanwhile, global equities were pressured after President Donald Trump indicated he may consider imposing import tariffs on China.
The Washington Post on Thursday reported that U.S. officials are beginning to explore proposals for punishing China for its handling of the pandemic, including punitive import tariffs, adding to bearish sentiment on Wall Street.
“Supply chains were already in a tough place given the pressure to global growth, the lack of transport of goods around the world, and hearing that there could be even more strains to supply chains in the form of tariffs is rightfully being priced into the market negatively,” Miskin said.
Stocks saw little movement after the Institute for Supply Management said its April manufacturing index came in at 41.5%. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch, on average, had looked for the gauge to plunge to 35% from a 49.1% reading in March. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in activity.
Crude oil prices closed out the week higher, with the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate Crude for June delivery CLM20, -0.45% gaining 94 cents, or 5%, to settle at $19.78 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In precious metals, June gold GCM20, +0.54% rose $6.70, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,700.90 an ounce on Comex.
The yield of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.615%edged 2 basis points higher to 0.63%.
Many global exchanges were closed Friday in observance of International Workers Day. Japan’s Nikkei 225 NIK, -2.84% closed 2.8% lower and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 UKX, -2.34% ended its session down 2.3%.
The U.S. dollar was unchanged relative to a basket of trading partners, according to the ICE U.S. Dollar index DXY, -0.33% .

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stocks May Have Hit A Ceiling</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The stock market averages had a great April with the Dow, S&P 500 and NASDAQ up 11.1%, 12.7% and 15.5%, respectively, And even though all the indexes were down over 2.5% on Friday they have all risen at least 25% from their lows of March 23 with the Dow being the strongest, up 28%. The challenge will be adding to these gains as earnings estimates continue to fall against very high valuations.
S&P 500 as expensive as late 2001
Estimates for the S&P 500 companies earnings have fallen by 25% since the beginning of the year per John Butter, Senior Earnings Analyst, at FactSet. His weekly “Earnings Insight” shows that the Index is now trading slightly above a 21x PE multiple on 2020’s profits with late 2001 being the last time this occurred. And even on 2021’s forecast the S&P 500 has a PE of almost 17x.
Bear trap or truly sustainable?
Given what has occurred in the economy with over 30 million people filing for unemployment insurance in just six weeks; economic reports showing huge drops in retail sales and industrial production; to an explosion of the federal deficit it is not surprising the S&P 500 fell 35%. What is interesting, to a large degree, is that it has rebounded by 27% and is now only 555 points or 16% below its all-time high.
This is largely due to the Federal government pumping trillions of dollars into the economy, the Federal Reserve also throwing trillions of dollars to stabilize the fixed income markets and incremental better news in the fight against the coronavirus. While the stock market tends to be forward looking, the financial outlook is biased to earnings estimates continuing to fall, which will increase already multi-year record high valuation multiples.
Estimates are almost guaranteed to decrease
The first estimate for March quarter’s GDP came in at a negative 4.8%. This was the worst showing since the December 2008 quarter when the economy shrank 8.4%.
Unfortunately, the economy is forecast to have a much worse outcome in the June quarter. While only one month has elapsed in it, estimates range from at least a mid-teens drop to downwards of 40%.
Keep in mind that these are annualized numbers. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA, does a quarter-to-quarter comparison and then multiplies by 4 to get a yearly result. While down 10% to get to a 40% number is definitely not in any way “good”, it should be kept in mind when hearing about a negative 40% projection.
S&P 500 earnings estimates took another hit this week
At the beginning of 2020 Butters was estimating that the S&P 500 companies would earn $177.77. With the S&P 500 valued at 3,231 its PE multiple was 18.2x. Below is how the estimate for this year’s S&P 500 earnings has decreased, with the first meaningful decline occurring during the week of March 20.
Note that the S&P 500’s PE multiple has increased from 18.2x at the beginning of the year to 21.2x currently.
2021 S&P earnings estimates
The first time Butters published an estimate for next year’s S&P 500’s earnings was on January 10. He was forecasting earnings of $196.57, which translated to a PE multiple of 16.4x. Below is how 2021’s earnings estimate has changed since then.
While it is possible the S&P 500’s earnings could rebound and start to move higher, history and what is occurring in the economy makes this unlikely. As shown in the chart above earnings estimates tend to decrease over time and we are only in May 2020 with more than a year to go for 2021 to play out. Earnings only need to decrease another $5 to essentially match 2018’s and $7 to reach 2017’s level. Both of those amounts were eclipsed during April when 2021’s projection fell by almost $15.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett Dumps Airlines and His Aerospace Pain Only Worsens</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. dumped its stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines but the billionaire investor remains deeply exposed to the collapse in air travel.
Berkshire still owns all of Precision Castparts Corp., a supplier of aerospace parts that’s bracing for lean times as Boeing Co. and Airbus SE cut jetliner production. Berkshire bought Precision Castparts in 2016 in a transaction valued at $37.2 billion, making it one of Buffett’s biggest deals.Now the maker of jet-engine blades and aircraft structural components is facing a double whammy as the coronavirus pandemic all but erases demand for flights, prompting airlines to park jets and slash schedules. That means less need for replacement parts and a big drop in aircraft purchasing. With carriers predicting that flying won’t return to 2019 levels for as long as three years, aerospace suppliers are hunkering down for a protracted slump.
“The current downturn is quite different from regular economic cycles,” said Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners in London. “Normally, there’s an exaggerated short-term impact with a fairly quick return. This time around, the impact seems to be significant as you’re looking at a collapse in air travel around the world.”
In the U.S. alone, passenger totals are down about 95% from a year ago. An index of major U.S. carriers has lost more than half its value this year, paced by a 70% drop for United Airlines Holdings Inc. Buffett said he lost money on his investments in the industry, which also included stakes in American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co.“The airline business -- and I may be wrong and I hope I’m wrong -- but I think it’s changed in a very major way,” Buffett said. “The future is much less clear to me.”
Airline shares sank sharply in pre-market U.S. trading Monday, with big players like American and United falling more than 10%. Boeing slid 4% while General Electric Co. was down 1.8%.
Greg Abel, Berkshire’s vice chairman for non-insurance operations, acknowledged at Berkshire’s annual meeting Saturday that Precision Castparts was getting hit, although its defense business remained strong. The parts maker is working to adjust the business to meet current demand, he said, and Buffett pointed out that the pain is rippling throughout the supply chain.
“We’re going to have aircraft in this country, we’re going to be flying. But the real question is whether you need a lot of new planes or not and when you’re likely to need them and it affects a lot of people,” Buffett said. “And it certainly affects Precision Castparts, it affects General Electric. It obviously affects Boeing.”
Boeing and Airbus have also tumbled by more than half, with steeper declines at suppliers such as Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. and Triumph Group Inc.“It’s good for Precision Castparts that they’re not a standalone public company right now, because if they were, they’d certainly have a very low stock price,” said James Armstrong, who oversees investments including Berkshire shares as president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates. “It’s not great news for them, but I don’t think that business goes away. I think it slows down.”
Precision Castparts has been hit by two massive and unpredictable blows that weren’t in any way its fault.
Even before the Covid-19 outbreak pushed airlines into the worst crisis in industry history, Boeing’s 737 Max was grounded in March 2019 after two deadly crashes. The Chicago-based planemaker halted production of the Max, its best-selling jet, earlier this year as the flying ban dragged on.
The fortunes of Precision Castparts are largely tied to those of Boeing, said Scott Hamilton, a consultant at Leeham Co. who publishes a popular aviation news website. As goes the aerospace giant, so goes its suppliers, he said.“Nobody could have foreseen the airline industry collapse in which 95% of the traffic evaporated virtually overnight,” Hamilton said. “Nobody could foresee the grounding of the Max lasting what may be 18 months. And just as Precision is tied to Boeing, Boeing is tied to the airlines.”
Precision Castparts watched its sales slip in the first quarter across all of its major markets, Berkshire said Saturday in its earnings report. That was partly due to the effects of Boeing’s Max problems as well as reduced shipments to customers hurt by the pandemic. That contributed to a 7.3% decline in pretax earnings in the period.
The parts maker ended up temporarily halting work at a plant in Portland, Oregon, and later said it would “significantly” cut its workforce, according to a report in The Oregonian. Berkshire said that the business faced higher production costs because of “manufacturing inefficiencies primarily attributable to Covid-19.”
Boeing also briefly paused production of multiple aircraft programs. The company has said it will reduce employment by 10%, or about 16,000 jobs, and lower production of jetliners including the 787 Dreamliner.
Precision Castparts, with its advanced technologies for casting and forging metals, will remain a key cog in the aerospace supply chain. In addition to the robust defense business in aircraft parts, the company serves customers in the power and energy industries.But with commercial air travel facing a long and uncertain recovery, Buffett’s bet on Precision Castparts will remain a drag on Berkshire for the foreseeable future.“That’s a big-time dud,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management, which owns Berkshire shares. “He obviously in retrospect made a real bad whole-company purchase.”

Delek Group Ltd., Israel’s largest energy company, received an auditors’ warning about its ability to repay debt as it scrambles to placate creditors in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
The questions about Delek’s ability to continue as a “going concern” were included in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings report on Sunday. Delek, controlled by investor Yitzhak Tshuva, estimates it will reach a deal on the terms of its credit, and plans to raise 400 million shekels ($114 million) this year to shore up its finances, Delek said in a statement.
It’s already carried out asset sales of more than 450 million shekels that were used to pay back loans, and decided to cut capital expenditures for 2020 in half to $125 million.
Banks and bondholders have been pressuring Delek for repayment of its debt after company shares started tanking in early March, just as the coronavirus spread to most of the world. Delek is on the hook for 2.8 billion shekels of debt this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Delek joins a host of energy firms facing a shaky future with demand for oil shrinking by 30% to 40% this year since prices for the commodity tumbled. Delek shares have dropped 70% this year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global Oil Demand Starts a Long, Painful and Uncertain Recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Few have a better watchtower over oil demand than Joe Gorder, chief executive officer of major U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp. But this week Gorder didn’t even need his business insight to know that fuel consumption was starting to recover in America.
He only needed to look at the streets of San Antonio, the Texas city where he’s based, to see traffic emerging after weeks of lockdown.
“People are starting to get out more,” Gorder said. “I think there probably is a pent-up demand for folks to get out of their houses and get mobile.”
From the streets of San Antonio to Barcelona and Beijing, traffic data, sales at fuel stations, and pipeline flows all suggest that the slump in oil demand probably bottomed out around the middle of April, and has now started a modest -- and very tentative -- recovery. The signs matter beyond the petroleum industry as they provide a glimmer of hope after a torrent of negative economic data.
“I believe we have seen the bottom,” said Marco Dunand, co-founder of Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., one of the world’s top-5 oil trading houses.
But the recovery is extremely slow. Oil traders believe it’s likely to take more than a year, and perhaps much longer, before global demand reaches the pre-pandemic levels of roughly 100 million barrels a day. A growing minority even speculate it may never get there again.
The likely shape of the revival has been a hotly contested topic. A V-shape was discarded a while ago. It’s possible it could be U-shaped, with a relatively long period along bottom, or L-shaped, with demand never returning to where it once was.
Perhaps the Latin alphabet doesn’t have a letter for the right shape. The square-root mathematical symbol may offer, to a point, an alternative: first a V-recovery as lockdowns are relaxed, followed by a long, flat tail as lifestyle changes, such as more work-from-home, become more normal.
Certainly, airlines don’t expect a return to the 2019 level of demand for years to come. It’s what Ed Morse, a veteran oil watcher at Citigroup Inc., calls “the winding, bumpy road to an oil recovery.”
The sheer scale of the demand destruction -- about 30 million barrels a day in April -- means the comeback is going to be a painful process. The International Energy Agency estimates that consumption will be down 25.8 million barrels a day in May, and 14.6 million in June. In December, it would still be 2.7 million a day below 2019 levels.
“We’re seeing improvements really across all three markets, we’ve seen in May volumes trending up in Europe, we see that happening in the U.S., and we see that also in Asia,” Darren Woods, CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp., told investors on Friday. “There are some, I’d say, encouraging early signs.”
The very gradual improvement comes just as producers, from the OPEC+ alliance to drillers in Texas, accelerate their output cuts. Together they could progressively push supply and demand into balance over time. In the past week, more companies, including big American firms such as ConocoPhillips, have announced fresh production closures.
“Globally, we are at the inflection point where we are past the worst for oil demand destruction but not for supply destruction,” Olivier Jakob, managing director at consultant Petromatrix GmbH. “This should help price stabilization.”
The process will take time, with unsold crude and oil products likely to accumulate well into June and perhaps even July. Storage tanks are nearly full, and brings with it the risk of New York crude gyrating wildly again when the June futures near expiry in the middle of this month, mirroring what happened when the May contract ended and sent prices below zero.
Even so, the physical oil market, where actual barrels change hands, is showing tentative signs of recovery, particularly in Europe. Urals, Russia’s flagship export grade, has risen to a premium over Brent after Moscow cut exports to a 10-year low.
The epicentre of the oil recovery is the same as where the public health crisis started in January: Wuhan. Weekday traffic in the Chinese city has almost returned to pre-crisis levels, although it remains depressed on weekends. It’s completely back to normal during rush hour in other major cities including Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, according to data from navigation company TomTom International BV.
“There are a few green shoots in some places like China,” said Jessica Uhl, finance head at Royal Dutch Shell Plc. “We have some of our retail stations where demand and volume is up above pre-Covid levels.”
Some of these shoots are also visible in one of the most battered industries -- aviation. Commercial operations worldwide are recovering slightly, with Flightradar24 data showing 33,500 flights taking off on April 30, the most in a month. However, that’s still two-thirds lower than from before the pandemic. Most airlines do not plan to fly again until July at the earliest.
In the oil industry itself, the recovery is patchy, and many worry that it could quickly reverse if a second wave of infections hit after lockdowns are relaxed. Diesel, which fuels trucks and industries, is holding up better than gasoline, which is doing a lot better than jet-fuel. Even when demand strengthens, crude consumption may remain low because refiners will have first to get rid of the millions of gallons of oil products that have piled up over the past weeks.
As with many economic indicators, oil demand data comes with a significant lag. So traders rely on proxy estimates for a near real-time view. One is highway traffic. Another is the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s trucked out from pipeline terminals into fuel stations.
In the U.S., the amount of gasoline supplied to the market increased last week to nearly 5.9 million barrels a day, up from 5.1 million in the first week of April but well below the typically more than 9 million before the virus, according to the official data. Early last month, refiners saw gasoline demand at 55% of normal level, which improved to 64% in the latest seven-day average. Valero confirmed on Thursday that it’s seeing some pick-up.
“I do think we’re going to see more activity,” Valero’s Gorder said.
Spain, which had one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe, offers a rare window into real-time demand as the nation’s biggest pipeline operator is disclosing weekly information. CLH Group said gasoline demand in the week to April 26 was down 75% from a year ago, a slight improvement from 81% in mid-April and 83% in late March.
In the U.K., demand for road fuels is currently down between 55% and 60% from levels before the crisis, compared with 65%-70% two weeks ago, according to the Petrol Retailers Association.
The data show that the recovery is only marginal. But it also indicates that consumption has, at the very least, bottomed out. Where demand goes, prices follow, and Torbjorn Tornqvist, head of commodity trading giant Gunvor Group Ltd, thinks the worst of oil’s slide is over.
Echoing a widely held view in the market, Tornqvist warns, however, that these subdued prices and demand may remain for a while. Prices aren’t likely to go much above $40 a barrel before the end of 2021, Tornqvist said. Only four months ago, at the start of this year, benchmark Brent crude was near $70. It was at about $26 a barrel on Monday.
“It’s going to take a long time to balance the market,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global Oil Demand Starts a Long, Painful and Uncertain Recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) — Few have a better watchtower over oil demand than Joe Gorder, chief executive officer of major U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp. But this week Gorder didn’t even need his business insight to know that fuel consumption was starting to recover in America.
He only needed to look at the streets of San Antonio, the Texas city where he’s based, to see traffic emerging after weeks of lockdown.
“People are starting to get out more,” Gorder said. “I think there probably is a pent-up demand for folks to get out of their houses and get mobile.”
From the streets of San Antonio to Barcelona and Beijing, traffic data, sales at fuel stations, and pipeline flows all suggest that the slump in oil demand probably bottomed out around the middle of April, and has now started a modest — and very tentative — recovery. The signs matter beyond the petroleum industry as they provide a glimmer of hope after a torrent of negative economic data.
“I believe we have seen the bottom,” said Marco Dunand, co-founder of Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., one of the world’s top-5 oil trading houses.
But the recovery is extremely slow. Oil traders believe it’s likely to take more than a year, and perhaps much longer, before global demand reaches the pre-pandemic levels of roughly 100 million barrels a day. A growing minority even speculate it may never get there again.
The likely shape of the revival has been a hotly contested topic. A V-shape was discarded a while ago. It’s possible it could be U-shaped, with a relatively long period along bottom, or L-shaped, with demand never returning to where it once was.
Perhaps the Latin alphabet doesn’t have a letter for the right shape. The square-root mathematical symbol may offer, to a point, an alternative: first a V-recovery as lockdowns are relaxed, followed by a long, flat tail as lifestyle changes, such as more work-from-home, become more normal.
‘Bumpy Road’
Certainly, airlines don’t expect a return to the 2019 level of demand for years to come. It’s what Ed Morse, a veteran oil watcher at Citigroup Inc., calls “the winding, bumpy road to an oil recovery.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING (Reuters) - General Motors’ sales in China saw double-digit year-on-year growth in April, its two local ventures said on Sunday, as the world’s biggest auto market recovers from the coronavirus.
GM’s (GM.N) joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp (600104.SS), which manufactures Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac vehicles, said its sales in China grew 13.6% compared to a year earlier. It said it had sold 111,155 units in April, including exported cars.
Meanwhile, SGMW, a separate GM venture with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group which produces no-frills minivans and has started to make higher-end cars, said its sales jumped 13.5% to over 127,000 units last month.
U.S. automaker GM, which is China’s second biggest foreign car company after Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), said its sales in China fell 43.3% in the first three months of 2020 compared with the same period last year.
To attract customers, GM and SAIC have hired social media celebrities to promote its new models and are offering free medical masks to customers.
China’s biggest automaker SAIC, which sold more than 6 million cars last year, said its sales rose 0.5% compared to the same period last year. As well as the GM venture, it also builds its own brand cars and operates a venture with Volkswagen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thyssenkrupp sees coronavirus cash squeeze despite elevator sale: letter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Germany’s Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) expects the coronavirus crisis to cause a new financial squeeze, scuppering hopes that selling its elevator business would deliver a swift cash respite for the embattled firm, its management board told staff in a letter.
The elevator division was sold in February to ease financial pressure on the conglomerate which has struggled for years after ill-fated investments. But the coronavirus crisis has dealt a blow before cash from that sale arrives in June.
Sources said last week that Thyssenkrupp had secured about 1 billion euros ($1.10 billion) in state aid to tide it over until sale proceeds arrive.
“In the medium term, the cash outflows caused by the corona (crisis) will in all likelihood result in the financial leeway created by the sale of the elevator business becoming much lower than what was originally anticipated,” the board wrote to staff.
“We are preparing solutions for this,” according to the April 30 letter signed by Chief Executive Martina Merz that was seen by Reuters and first reported by German daily Handelsblatt.
Thyssenkrupp agreed to sell its elevators division to a consortium of Advent, Cinven and Germany’s RAG foundation for 17.2 billion euros in February, with proceeds expected to be received in June.
A source said the loan from state development bank KfW would assist the conglomerate, which has suffered from slow demand for auto parts after carmakers shut down production because of the pandemic. The loan expires at the end of September
Car makers and suppliers have scrambled to shore up their liquidity as sales in Europe tumbled by more than 50% in March.
Thyssenkrupp has been pummelled in recent years by a downturn in the car market, multiple leadership changes and an overly complex group structure. Its shares hit historic lows around 3.20 euros in mid-March.
As well as selling its elevator business, Thyssenkrupp’s restructuring involves seeking buyers for its Plant Technology division, which builds cement, chemicals and fertiliser plants.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUESSELDORF: Germany's Thyssenkrupp expects the coronavirus crisis to cause a new financial squeeze, scuppering hopes that selling its elevator business would deliver a swift cash respite for the embattled firm, its management board told staff in a letter.
The elevator division was sold in February to ease financial pressure on the conglomerate which has struggled for years after ill-fated investments. But the coronavirus crisis has dealt a blow before cash from that sale arrives in June.
Sources said last week that Thyssenkrupp had secured about 1 billion euros (US$1.10 billion) in state aid to tide it over until sale proceeds arrive.
"In the medium term, the cash outflows caused by the corona (crisis) will in all likelihood result in the financial leeway created by the sale of the elevator business becoming much lower than what was originally anticipated," the board wrote to staff.
"We are preparing solutions for this," according to the Apr 30 letter signed by Chief Executive Martina Merz that was seen by Reuters and first reported by German daily Handelsblatt.
Thyssenkrupp agreed to sell its elevators division to a consortium of Advent, Cinven and Germany's RAG foundation for 17.2 billion euros in February, with proceeds expected to be received in June.
A source said the loan from state development bank KfW would assist the conglomerate, which has suffered from slow demand for auto parts after carmakers shut down production because of the pandemic. The loan expires at the end of September
Car makers and suppliers have scrambled to shore up their liquidity as sales in Europe tumbled by more than 50 per cent in March.
Thyssenkrupp has been pummelled in recent years by a downturn in the car market, multiple leadership changes and an overly complex group structure. Its shares hit historic lows around 3.20 euros in mid-March.
As well as selling its elevator business, Thyssenkrupp's restructuring involves seeking buyers for its Plant Technology division, which builds cement, chemicals and fertiliser plants.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US-China angst tests ‘sell in May’ mantra for emerging markets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Even without all the prevailing risks to the global economy, emerging-market investors head into the first full week of May with history against them.Because in eight of the past 10 years, May has proved a losing month for stocks, currencies and local bonds in developing economies.
The uncertainty over the Covid-19 pandemic, a resurgence in U.S.-China tension and the collapse in corporate earnings merely makes the likelihood of declines this coming week all the stronger. Emerging markets pared weekly gains on Friday while implied currency volatility jumped by the most in six weeks as President Donald Trump revived an attack on China, speculating it could have spread the coronavirus and threatening trade tariffs.
“The biggest new development that could weigh on emerging markets is the pick-up in geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China,” said Eric Stein, the Boston-based co-director of global fixed income at Eaton Vance Corp., which manages about $500 billion. “Negativity still hangs over the asset class,” even as global monetary and fiscal stimulus lifted emerging markets during April, he said.
Purchasing managers index data due for release from a number of developing countries this week will offer clues on the depth of the downturn after China’s report on Thursday showed overseas demand slumped. Last month’s gains in the Indonesian rupiah and Philippine peso may be tested as the two nations announce gross domestic product data.
Interest-rate decisions will also be in focus in Malaysia, the Czech Republic and Chile. However, the most significant policy meeting may be in Brazil, where a fresh political storm involving President Jair Bolsonaro and the easing of lockdown measures even as the virus infection rate rises have combined to make the real the world’s worst-performing currency this year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global stocks will keep a cap on any major gains this week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: As companies and economies further reveal the damage caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, markets will stay wary of making any significant gains this week.
Global stocks closed marginally higher last week as investors cautiously raked in gains in spite of dire economic data and corporate earnings that demonstrated the devastating effect of lockdowns.
Markets ended April in comparatively better shape amid growing optimism that movement restrictions will be eased further this month as countries entered the recovery phase of the coronavirus crisis.
However, sentiment turned sour on Friday after US President Trump threatened to levy tariffs on China for their handling of the coronavirus outbreak – reviving an issue that dogged markets all through last year, the US-China trade spat.
Before this latest sign of market weakness, the S&P 500, an index broadly considered to represent global markets, rallied over 36 per cent since March-lows, and also recovered over 65 per cent of the COVID-19 selloff.
One cannot dismiss growing doubts on whether the seemingly unending trade tensions between the world’s top two economies will flare up again in the near term.
But while this calls for market participants to turn nervous, analysts feel it is more likely that investors will use it as an excuse to lock in profits.
“With the US Presidential election only six months away, President Trump is unlikely to follow through on any of the upcoming tariff threats,” wrote Ed Moya, a market analyst with OANDA.
“The main driver for weakness in stocks is the profit-taking with mega-caps Apple and Amazon,” Moya further added, referring to the market decline seen during the end of last week.
While tech giant and iPhone maker Apple last week reported sales and profits that beat Wall Street expectations, CEO Tim Cook warned of uncertain times ahead. Also, Amazon signaled they are spending all of their second quarter profits on its coronavirus response, while calling for caution among its investors.
Beyond coronavirus, the focus this week again will be on central banks with scheduled meetings of the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of Australia, with no policy changes expected.
“We do not expect significant announcements from either (RBA or BoE) as measures previously announced remain a work in progress,” said Aditya Pugalia, director of financial markets research at Emirates NBD.
“Investors will also keenly watch the non-farm payroll data which is likely to confirm the extent of damage to employment as shown by initial jobless claims figures.”
Analysts expect a total of 20 million people to be unemployed in the US, while the jobless rate balloons to 14 per cent in the world’s biggest economy.
“This is no surprise, given the way initial jobless claims have surged over the past month, but comes as a stark reminder of the challenges facing the world’s largest economy,” noted Chris Beauchamp, IG chief market analyst at online trader IG Group.
Also, US earnings will continue to come through thick and fast, with Disney, PayPal and Uber the names to watch, as investors wait to see how these firms are dealing with the global economic crisis.
The improvement in risk appetite in global markets was underpinned by central banks reaffirming their commitment to providing ample support as and when required.
“Global equities, over the past month, have remained in a league of their own,” Pugalia added. “The price movement indicates that equity investors retained their focus on central bank support and easing measures announced by various governments.”
Many investors are under the impression that any ease in stringent curfews will give way to a sharp global recoveries in the second half of the year with the hope the negative fallout will be short-lived, especially if a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is found.
However, most analysts are distancing themselves from this general market wide optimism, while calling for more volatility going forward.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bad loans key to Westpac dividend as payout suspended</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Westpac chief executive Peter King says the severity of the COVID-19 economic shock and how much damage it inflicts on the bank's loan book will be the key factors influencing dividend policy, after a historic suspension of payments.
The lending giant on Monday said cash profit plunged 70 per cent to $993 million because of heavy charges for bad debts and last year's money laundering scandal, and it would not pay a dividend in June due to the uncertain outlook.
With the bank setting aside $1.6 billion to cover for bad loans for the crisis, Mr King maintained its "base case" was for a V-shaped recovery that would still result in unemployment of 9 per cent this quarter.
While some analysts said they did not expect a dividend this half, Mr King said the bank would be closely watching how tens of thousands of customers given loan deferrals fared in the months ahead.
"We will monitor the situation, we will look at our book and the performance of the credit book is really the key piece to look at,” he said.
“If the economy comes back on a quicker path, then maybe a decision could be earlier, if it comes back on a slower path then the last time, we would look at it as part of the full-year results.”
In an attempt to minimise the economic carnage caused by the pandemic, banks have deployed loan repayment deferrals and emergency loans to hundreds of thousands of customers in recent months. Westpac said 105,000 mortgage accounts worth $39 billion had been put on hold, alongside 31,000 business loans with a value of $8.2 billion.
Mr King, who was appointed CEO last month after acting in the role since last year, also flagged potential asset sales as he seeks to narrow the lender's focus to banking.
The bank has had re-hired Westpac executive Jason Yetton to oversee a review of businesses including wealth platforms, superannuation and retirement products, investments, general and life insurance, and auto loans. The businesses would be put into a new division and could be sold off, the bank said.
Westpac's results were dominated by the impact of COVID-19, which has lenders bracing for a wave of bad loans, which directly eat into profits.
The bank's closely watched common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital, an important gauge of strength, was 10.8 per cent of risk-weighted assets, above the level of 10.5 per cent targeted by regulators.
But, as previously disclosed by the bank, profits in the half were hit by a $1.6 billion charge for COVID-19 and a $900 million provision for the penalty over the AUSTRAC scandal.
As the provisions for bad debts were announced in the weeks leading up to the result, some analysts said the underlying results from Westpac were not as weak as feared. Its stock price closed 2.8 per cent higher, at $15.77.
The dividend suspension is the latest move by an Australian bank to defer its dividend decision, following ANZ Bank last week and Bank of Queensland last month.
Plato Asset Management managing director Don Hamson said he did not expect Westpac or ANZ to pay dividends in the current half. “That’s going to be a six month hole in investors’ incomes,” he said.
Macquarie analyst Victor German also forecast there would most likely not be a dividend paid this half. "Like ANZ, WBC’s CET1 position of 10.8 per cent is at the lower end of peers, and we expect WBC will not pay the dividend unless conditions improve materially," Mr German said.
Mr King painted a bleak picture on the outlook, saying the economy would contract sharply this quarter and not bounce back until late in the December quarter. The bank's base case assumed a 15 per cent decline in house prices and a further 5 per cent next year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bad loans key to Westpac dividend as payout suspended</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Westpac chief executive Peter King says the severity of the COVID-19 economic shock and how much damage it inflicts on the bank's loan book will be the key factors influencing dividend policy, after a historic suspension of payments.
The lending giant on Monday said cash profit plunged 70 per cent to $993 million because of heavy charges for bad debts and last year's money laundering scandal, and it would not pay a dividend in June due to the uncertain outlook.
With the bank setting aside $1.6 billion to cover for bad loans for the crisis, Mr King maintained its "base case" was for a V-shaped recovery that would still result in unemployment of 9 per cent this quarter.
While some analysts said they did not expect a dividend this half, Mr King said the bank would be closely watching how tens of thousands of customers given loan deferrals fared in the months ahead.
"We will monitor the situation, we will look at our book and the performance of the credit book is really the key piece to look at,” he said.
“If the economy comes back on a quicker path, then maybe a decision could be earlier, if it comes back on a slower path then the last time, we would look at it as part of the full-year results.”
In an attempt to minimise the economic carnage caused by the pandemic, banks have deployed loan repayment deferrals and emergency loans to hundreds of thousands of customers in recent months. Westpac said 105,000 mortgage accounts worth $39 billion had been put on hold, alongside 31,000 business loans with a value of $8.2 billion.
Mr King, who was appointed CEO last month after acting in the role since last year, also flagged potential asset sales as he seeks to narrow the lender's focus to banking.
The bank has had re-hired Westpac executive Jason Yetton to oversee a review of businesses including wealth platforms, superannuation and retirement products, investments, general and life insurance, and auto loans. The businesses would be put into a new division and could be sold off, the bank said.
Westpac's results were dominated by the impact of COVID-19, which has lenders bracing for a wave of bad loans, which directly eat into profits.
The bank's closely watched common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital, an important gauge of strength, was 10.8 per cent of risk-weighted assets, above the level of 10.5 per cent targeted by regulators.
But, as previously disclosed by the bank, profits in the half were hit by a $1.6 billion charge for COVID-19 and a $900 million provision for the penalty over the AUSTRAC scandal.
As the provisions for bad debts were announced in the weeks leading up to the result, some analysts said the underlying results from Westpac were not as weak as feared. Its stock price closed 2.8 per cent higher, at $15.77.
The dividend suspension is the latest move by an Australian bank to defer its dividend decision, following ANZ Bank last week and Bank of Queensland last month.
Plato Asset Management managing director Don Hamson said he did not expect Westpac or ANZ to pay dividends in the current half. “That’s going to be a six month hole in investors’ incomes,” he said.
Macquarie analyst Victor German also forecast there would most likely not be a dividend paid this half. "Like ANZ, WBC’s CET1 position of 10.8 per cent is at the lower end of peers, and we expect WBC will not pay the dividend unless conditions improve materially," Mr German said.
Mr King painted a bleak picture on the outlook, saying the economy would contract sharply this quarter and not bounce back until late in the December quarter. The bank's base case assumed a 15 per cent decline in house prices and a further 5 per cent next year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wizz Air to launch Dhs245 flights from Abu Dhabi to Europe in June</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Wizz Air has announced today (Sunday May 3) that it will launch low-budget flights from Abu Dhabi to multiple European destinations, starting next month.The airline, which is the largest low-cost option in central and Eastern Europe, has introduced five new routes from Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH) – two of which the airline has said will start operating in June.Travellers in the UAE capital will be able to fly directly to Budapest and Bucharest from June onward, with prices to Budapest starting from around Dhs245 (EUR59.99). Additional routes to Cluj-Napoca, Katowice and Sofia will then be operating directly from Abu Dhabi from September 2020, though this is subject to aviation activities being resumed (following travel restrictions due to COVID-19) in the respective countries.Back in March, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi was established as a local airline in the city and acts as Wizz Air’s first airline established outside of Europe.Commenting on the new routes, Shareef Al Hashmi, Chief Executive Officer of Abu Dhabi Airports said: “Wizz Air’s new routes to Budapest, Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Katowice and Sofia highlights our commitment to connecting Abu Dhabi with the most sought after global destinations. These new routes positively reflect the industry’s resilience and its capability to continue pushing forward with bold plans that will stimulate consumer demand and the sustained recovery of the aviation market.”He continued: “As our newest landing partner, we welcome Wizz Air and its first routes with open arms as we get set to facilitate the carrier’s exciting Abu Dhabi expansion plans. Visitors from Hungary, Romania, Poland and Bulgaria can look forward to enjoying our modern terminal facilities with a unique brand of Arabian hospitality before seamlessly heading out to experience the UAE’s thriving capital city, Abu Dhabi.”The first flight to Budapest is scheduled for June 3 with prices starting at around Dhs245 (EUR 59.99).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wizz Air to launch first European low cost flights to Abu Dhabi</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: Wizz Air, the largest low-cost airline in central and eastern Europe, announced on Sunday five new lost cost routes from Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH).
The routes will connect Abu Dhabi with Budapest and Bucharest from June 2020 and with Cluj-Napoca, Katowice and Sofia from September 2020, subject to aviation activities being resumed in the respective countries.
It is intended that Wizz Air will focus on establishing routes to markets in which Wizz Air has existing, high growth operations, namely central and eastern and western Europe, as well as the Indian subcontinent, Middle East and Africa, over the long run.
“These new routes positively reflect the industry’s resilience and its capability to continue pushing forward with bold plans that will stimulate consumer demand and the sustained recovery of the aviation market,” said Shareef Al Hashmi, chief executive officer of Abu Dhabi Airports.
These services will be the first direct routes between Abu Dhabi and Budapest, Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Katowice and Sofia adding an almost 220 thousand seat capacity to the airline’s Abu Dhabi network per year. Flights are already on sale and can be booked at wizzair.com from as low as 59.99 Euros.
In the case of travel bans, imposed due to the COVID-19 outbreak, impacting the start date of the flights, the passengers with bookings for the affected flights will have a chance to rebook for a later date, get full cash refund or 120% of the value of the booking in WIZZ Credit that can be used for purchase of WIZZ flights and services.
“Today’s announcement underpins our long term dedication to bringing low fares combined with a high quality onboard experience to ever more customers in Abu Dhabi,” said Jozsef Varadi, CEO of Wizz Air Holdings.
“Wizz Air’s mission feeds into Abu Dhabi’s diversified economic strategy as we continue to stimulate traffic by creating demand to the benefit of growing Abu Dhabi’s touristic and economic diversity,” he added.
The announcement supplements the agreement in March formalising the establishment of Wizz Air Abu Dhabi as a local airline based in Abu Dhabi in partnership between ADQ and Wizz Air.
The new airline – Abu Dhabi’s second low cost carrier – will start its own operations in the fourth quarter of this year, as the airline moves ahead with its plans without delay.
“Wizz Air Abu Dhabi aims to launch operations in the fourth quarter of this calendar year as well as working on scaling up the launch plan, while being in progress of obtaining regulatory approval from the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority,” Wizz Air Holdings said in a statement to Gulf News.
“We firmly believe that lowest cost always wins. Our ultra low cost model allows for ultra low fares to stimulate consumer demand,” it added, stating the airline was confident in demand for low cost options once travel restrictions loosen up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New apps emerge amid COVID-19 to tackle gripes with popular delivery services</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO -- When the weekend rolls around, Torontonians won't have to miss the White Lily Diner's thick-cut bacon, organic corn grits and toast smeared in rhubarb hibiscus jam just because the country has plunged into a pandemic.
The east-end diner is selling its brunch staples and offering to drop them at customers' doors, but the process won't involve any of the familiar delivery apps whose couriers have become a fixture on busy streets in recent years.
Instead of relying on Uber Eats, SkipTheDishes or DoorDash, White Lily is using a new entrant to the market: Tock To Go.
"The biggest draw off the bat was probably just the fact that they're so much less expensive," said White Lily co-owner Ashley Lloyd, who laid off her entire staff when she closed the restaurant to dine-in meals amid COVID-19.
"Restaurant margins are slim...I can understand people turning to (their delivery competitors), but honestly I don't know how they do it."
Tock To Go is part of a new wave of food delivery companies hitting the Canadian market, hoping to attract vendors with features like lower commissions and fill the hole Foodora will leave behind when it shutters its Canadian operations in mid-May.
The services -- Ottawa's Love Local Delivery, Vancouver's From To, Toronto's volunteer-run iRover and new delivery features on Montreal's Eva -- have been created to help out in a tough moment, when restaurants are barely scraping by -- even as demand for food delivery surges.
These services want to do things differently from the household names, so they have eliminated commission fees or offered rates well below the 10- to 30-per cent charged by Uber Eats, SkipTheDishes, DoorDash and others.
Tock To Go, a Chicago-based service from restaurateur Nick Kokonas that evolved from his Tock reservation system, only takes a 3 per cent commission from restaurants in Vancouver and Toronto.
Tock first appeared in the cities in 2018, but didn't launch Tock to Go until the pandemic started. Tock to Go doesn't have couriers to deliver meals. Instead, it asks customers to pre-order food, helping restaurants arrange their own delivery.
"Ordering apps take up to 20 to 30 (per cent), which simply is not sustainable for restaurants," Tock's director of marketing Kyle Welter said in an email.
"Tock allows each restaurant to specify the number of orders for any set time range, so the kitchen doesn't get overwhelmed and they can responsibly manage the flow of customers."
Over in B.C., Brandon Grossutti from Gastown restaurant Pidgin will launch From To, a delivery service with a handful of Vancouver eateries, in May.
In the weeks before restaurants in Canada closed to stop the spread of COVID-19, Grossutti realized Pidgin would need a takeout option, so he signed up with Uber Eats and Burnaby-based Fantuan Delivery.
"Then the reality of it hit. We did fairly well gross wise, but you see the checks coming in and...the first week was a lot of money out the door in commissions," said Grossutti, who had to lay off workers
"It's a weirdly parasitic relationship where you have a parasite basically eating its hosts until it dies and it's not a sustainable relationship."
Grossutti decided to put his software industry background to work. He made From To, which gives restaurants the ability to decide if they want to pay for, split with or pass on customers' delivery costs.
From To currently takes no commission.
"We had talked at certain points about taking like 5 per cent, which would be much less than what's out there, but we realized that during this time we need to make this sustainable because people are already losing money," Grossutti said.
The lower commissions don't seem to have bothered rivals.
"We welcome new competitors to the market, as it raises awareness of the industry and promotes even more traffic to restaurants to stimulate growth," Winnipeg-bred SkipTheDishes said in an email to The Canadian Press.
"It is natural for competitors to see value in this market and we're confident in Skip's position as Canada's homegrown food delivery company."
SkipTheDishes is offering a 10.5 per cent commission deal to restaurants wanting to do their own deliveries but still use the platform and is expediting payments to all businesses using its services.
Meanwhile, San Francisco-based Uber Eats is eliminating its fees on pickup orders and reducing its usual 30 per cent charges to 15 per cent for restaurants who choose to use their own delivery people.
DoorDash, also headquartered in San Francisco, is waiving April commission fees for new, independent clients. Existing independent clients can have those fees waived on pickup orders, and 100,000 clients were added to DashPass -- its subscription program which offers $0 delivery for consumers -- for free.
Harriet Clunie, the executive chef at European-style bistro Das Lokal, said that is not enough because the moves put the onus on restaurateurs to offset costs or hire their own delivery staff to take advantage of benefits.
She banded together with other members of the Ottawa restaurant community to found Love Local Delivery, a service that launched in March and will courier food within 5 kilometres of restaurants for a flat $5 fee, or more for longer distances.
There are no commission fees right now and the service focuses solely on independently-owned restaurants.
While it might have to charge commission when it launches an app in the near future, Clunie said the service is committed to keeping that potential fee low.
"It's all people that are in the same boat and we're trying to help everybody that's struggling, restaurants or small businesses or drivers that are unemployed and just trying to make some money to feed the family," she said.
"It's an approach that's really trying to lift everybody up."

“We had talked at certain points about taking like 5 per cent, which would be much less than what’s out there, but we realized that during this time we need to make this sustainable because people are already losing money,” Grossutti said.
The lower commissions don’t seem to have bothered rivals.
“We welcome new competitors to the market, as it raises awareness of the industry and promotes even more traffic to restaurants to stimulate growth,” Winnipeg-bred SkipTheDishes said in an email to The Canadian Press.
“It is natural for competitors to see value in this market and we’re confident in Skip’s position as Canada’s homegrown food delivery company.”

SkipTheDishes is offering a 10.5 per cent commission deal to restaurants wanting to do their own deliveries but still use the platform and is expediting payments to all businesses using its services.
Meanwhile, San Francisco-based Uber Eats is eliminating its fees on pickup orders and reducing its usual 30 per cent charges to 15 per cent for restaurants who choose to use their own delivery people.
DoorDash, also headquartered in San Francisco, is waiving April commission fees for new, independent clients. Existing independent clients can have those fees waived on pickup orders, and 100,000 clients were added to DashPass — its subscription program which offers $0 delivery for consumers — for free.
Harriet Clunie, the executive chef at European-style bistro Das Lokal, said that is not enough because the moves put the onus on restaurateurs to offset costs or hire their own delivery staff to take advantage of benefits.
She banded together with other members of the Ottawa restaurant community to found Love Local Delivery, a service that launched in March and will courier food within 5 kilometres of restaurants for a flat $5 fee, or more for longer distances.
There are no commission fees right now and the service focuses solely on independently-owned restaurants.
While it might have to charge commission when it launches an app in the near future, Clunie said the service is committed to keeping that potential fee low.
“It’s all people that are in the same boat and we’re trying to help everybody that’s struggling, restaurants or small businesses or drivers that are unemployed and just trying to make some money to feed the family,” she said.
“It’s an approach that’s really trying to lift everybody up.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO -- Five things to watch for in the Canadian business world in the coming week:
AIR CANADA EARNINGS
Air Canada will hold a conference call to discuss its first-quarter results on Monday. The airline announced on April 8 that it planned to rehire 16,500 laid-off workers via Ottawa's emergency wage subsidy, though the vast majority would remain at home amid the collapse of global travel triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
LATEST FROM THE OILPATCH
Thursday is a big earnings day in the oilpatch, with results expected from Enbridge, Canadian Natural Resources, Inter Pipeline, Pembina Pipeline and more. Results last week from Husky Energy, Cenovus, Imperial Oil and Precision Drilling portrayed an industry in crisis amid plummeting demand and sinking oil prices.
SHOPIFY UPDATE
Shopify Inc. will release its first-quarter results and hold a conference call with financial analysts on Wednesday. The Ottawa-based technology company recently began offering interest-free cash advances to help companies that use its e-commerce products cope with the impacts of COVID-19. The initiative is meant to provide fast relief to cash-strapped businesses without having to take on debt.
BCE EARNINGS
BCE Inc. will release its results Thursday. Rival Rogers Communications recently revealed that it felt the first financial bite from the COVID-19 pandemic during the tail end of its first quarter and senior executives said they expect conditions will get worse in months to come.
APRIL JOB NUMBERS
Statistics Canada will release the findings of its labour force survey for April on Friday. More than one million Canadians lost their jobs at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in March, pushing the national unemployment rate up 2.2 percentage points to 7.8 per cent, the highest it has been since October 2010. Economists are expecting the April numbers to be even worse, with up to three million jobs lost.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pick n Pay extends shopping times for pensioners and Sassa grant beneficiaries</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An hour of shopping dedicated to pensioners will be moved this week to accommodate Sassa payouts, retailer Pick n Pay has announced.
The pensioners' shopping hour – a dedicated time for elderly customers to have exclusive use of the store to shop for their groceries and essentials – will move from Wednesdays, and will now take place on Mondays and Tuesdays.
Stores will open an hour earlier - between 07:00 and 08:00 - exclusively for customers over the age of 65 years, and for pension and Sassa disabled grant beneficiaries, before opening to all customers at 08:00.
From Wednesday to Friday, all stores will open early at 07:00 to help accommodate Sassa social grants.
The weekly pensioners' shopping hour will resume on Wednesdays from 13 May. 
The move comes as "many shoppers prepare to do their grocery shopping", and would ensure safe shopping and that shelves remain stocked, explained the retailer's marketing executive, John Bradshaw.
"We are opening early to help our customers get their grants in a less crowded environment. All stores will be well stocked and prepared for the week so that customers can get the groceries they want during one shop," he said.
Staff will assist customers to collect their grants and customers are reminded that they can use their Sassa card to pay for grocery items directly. All stores have safety measures in place, including physical distancing measures, limiting the number of customers in store, hand sanitiser, perspex screens at till points, and staff wearing cloth face masks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mahindra Holidays to first reopen resorts near metro cities post lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mahindra Holidays & Resorts India Ltd (MHRIL) on Sunday said it plans to first reopen resorts that are at drivable distance from the metro cities once the coronavirus lockdown is lifted.
The Mahindra Group firm has currently suspended operations at its resorts in compliance with government directives.
“At Club Mahindra we have over 2,55,000 member families and once travel restrictions are relaxed and state borders open up, and people feel comfortable enough to travel again, we expect our members and their families to start travelling to our resorts in their own vehicles, since we are at drivable distances from major cities,” MHRIL MD and CEO Kavinder Singh told PTI.
The company is gearing up for this by putting in place all the necessary safety related standard operating procedures (SOPs). It will ensure the highest levels of hygiene standards (hospital grade) to achieve a quick return to normalcy, he added.
“We will first open resorts that are at a drivable distance from the major metro cities,” Singh said. He, however, did not share the number of resorts that would be opened in the first phase. The company has over 100 resorts in India and abroad.
Asked about the steps the company is taking to ensure the health and safety of guests and employees at the resorts, Singh said: “In view of the current situation we are implementing various SOPs, which will cover hygiene and disinfection norms at all the touch-points in our resorts.”
The company will ensure social distancing norms for members at its resorts. The resorts are much bigger than traditional hotels, have open spaces and are spread out and this helps in facilitating social distancing norms, he added.
“The entire guest experience right from check-in to resort experiences, including F&B, will be contactless. Our best-in-class experiences will help keep our members and their families engaged, while maintaining the highest safety and hygiene standards,” Singh said.
Club Mahindra is partnering with experts in the healthcare and technology spaces to implement these enhanced safety procedures and contactless services, he added.
Asked about the impact of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown on the hospitality industry, Singh said: “COVID-19 is a true Black Swan event that presents an unprecedented challenge to the hospitality and aviation industries in India and globally. It has deeply impacted the hospitality industry with occupancies declining sharply, as India went into lockdown from March 25.”
According to recent estimates, the overall revenue of the Indian hotel industry will decline by about Rs 90,000 crore in 2020, an erosion of 57 per cent compared to last year. More importantly, it is estimated that there will be around 38 million job losses, he said.
On the way forward for the industry, Singh said the sector expects a slow recovery as there will be many strict travel restrictions, even as the lockdown is lifted. Domestic travel will begin much faster than international travel, but both will take some time to fully recover.
He further said the industry is expecting support from the government for its survival.
“Most of the hospitality players have debt on their books and the industry is hoping for a debt recast and for the moratorium to be extended to 12 months. This would certainly provide much-needed relief,” Singh said.
The industry is also hoping for waiver or deferment of statutory payments and minimum electricity demand charges as this will help it with the working capital situation, he added.
“The industry also employs millions of people, so it would be helpful if there is some level of support for them, such as a direct benefit package for the staff who keep the industry running,” Singh said.
As a step to revive the industry, the annual leave travel allowance (LTA) should be made tax-free, every year, so that people have more money to spend on travel once things get better, he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Afterpay dismisses security fears after WeChat owner builds $300m stake</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Afterpay chief executive Anthony Eisen has dismissed suggestions the emergence of the $800 billion owner of Chinese messaging app WeChat on its shareholder register could expose the buy now pay later platform to security risks.
The Australian payments juggernaut disclosed late on Friday that one of China's biggest companies, Tencent, had picked up a 5 per cent stake in the company for $300 million. Tencent owns the popular Chinese messaging app WeChat which has reportedly been banned by the Australian Defence Department due to security concerns.
But Mr Eisen said Afterpay was not concerned about security risks and more excited about the collaboration opportunities its new shareholder might bring to the table.
"There’s no board representation. It’s purely a financial investment," said Mr Eisen in an interview.
"So we’re not contemplating that relationship to be of a different form to that. And in terms of opportunities, as they arise, we’ll approach it in what you would typically expect to be the right governance formats of any publicly listed company," he said.
Tencent's investment into Afterpay comes after it last month launched a buy now, pay later platform of its own on WeChat, which has more than 1 billion monthly active users. But Mr Eisen said Afterpay would maintain its focus as a consumer finance provider. “We’re maintaining our consumer and retail focus it’s not about deviating from that for us,” he said.
Afterpay co-founder Nick Molnar said Afterpay could learn from Tencent's global scale. “I think there's a combination of, 'how do we learn from people who have scaled globally and understand deeply the payments infrastructure at a global level'. And then just also what potential collaboration opportunities to give the most value to our retail partners,” said Mr Molnar.
Tencent spoke of developing a long term partnership with Afterpay.
"Afterpay's approach stands out to us not just for its attractive business model characteristics, but also because its service aligns so well with consumer trends we see developing globally in terms of Afterpay's customer centric, interest free approach as well as its integrated retail presence and ability to add significant value for its merchant base," Tencent's chief strategy officer James Mitchell said in a statement to the ASX released on Friday.
"We look forward to a deep and long-term business partnership between Tencent and Afterpay," he added.
Tencent's substantial shareholder notice revealed that it started acquiring Afterpay shares in late March.
This was just after Afterpay shares hit a multi year low of $8.90 as market concerns grew about the company's ability to deal with its first ever economic downturn and potential bad debts if its customers were not able to pay their bills.
The fintech told investors last month that it could insulate its business model from high-risk clients and avoid any uptick in bad debts from cash-strapped customers.
Tencent paid just over $300 million for a five per cent stake in the buy now pay later provider. The stake is now worth $390 million.
Afterpay shares closed at $29.16 on Friday. The stock is flat so far in 2020, compared to a 22 per cent fall for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Private donors match crisis cash for artists</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A crisis fund for artists has been set up with the aim of gifting $1000 to 1000 unemployed creatives across the nation.
Creative Partnerships Australia, a Commonwealth corporation that encourages a culture of private sector support for the arts, will provide seed money for the campaign, offering to match donations up until $110,000, potentially doubling the impact of donations.
CPA will also extend its offer to the National Association of the Visual Arts’ Artists’ Benevolent Fund that offers eligible artists a one-off payment of $2000 for immediate assistance following a disaster or catastrophic event such as COVID-19.
Arts Minister Paul Fletcher said the funding initiative from Creative Partnerships Australia would complement the federal government's existing 0support measures. CPA provides Australian government funding as co-matched contributions with private sector contributions to fund activities in the arts sector.
But artists continue to report loopholes in the JobSeeker and JobKeeper wage subsidy program.
Casuals and contractors working for state entities such as the Art Gallery of NSW, the Sydney Opera House, National Gallery of Victoria, and Melbourne Arts Centre are ineligible for the JobKeeper scheme due to a long-standing convention between state and federal governments, according to the Members Entertainment and Arts Alliance.
The 1000 X 1000 Crisis Cash for Artists aims to provide stop-gap support for those arts workers slipping through the JobKeeper or JobSeeker safety nets.
It is to be promoted through more than 40 arts organisations affiliated with Theatre Network Australia including Sydney Theatre Company, Belvoir, Force Majeure, Circus Oz, and Circa with the campaign to raise $1 million to provide grants of $1000 to 1000 independent artists in the performing arts who can demonstrate loss of income as a result of COVID-19.
Theatre Network Australia chair Jill Smith said CPA's matched funding would act as an incentive for more donors to come on board, knowing that a donation of $1000 would support two artists instead of one.
"The independent sector has been devastated by the shutdown of the arts due to COVID-19, and a small grant can pay for urgent materials, technology, or just pay a gas bill."
Creative Partnerships Australia chief executive officer Fiona Menzies said the offer to match funds acknowledged the adversity and isolation that artists felt and the impact of the temporary closure of venues and postponement of events were having on livelihoods.
Matched funding was a proven way to attract additional funds from the private sector to the arts, she said.
"It is our hope that this funding will assist to immediately respond to the critical situation facing Australia’s artists, and to help sustain our vibrant creative sector."
Casuals at the Sydney Opera House have been without shifts since the closure of its public spaces in mid-March. These workers were provided with six weeks of income maintenance support up until April 26 when wage-subsidy schemes came into full effect.
"We are calling on the federal government to work with the states on a solution so these hundreds of thousands of workers, also local government, are not left in the cold and forced to go onto social security," a Media and Entertainment Alliance Australia spokesperson said.
"The federal government could fix this by amending the eligibility criteria for JobKeeper, or the states could step into the breach to subsidise the income of public sector employees stood down because of coronavirus."
Art Gallery of NSW confirmed it was not eligible to apply for the JobKeeper payments.
"Our permanent, full-time and temporary staff continue to work behind the scenes while our doors are closed to the public," a gallery spokesperson said.
"During this period we have also sought to retain and redeploy a number of our regular casuals within the gallery."
The Opera House's chief executive officer, Louise Herron, said the venue was committed to supporting staff as much as possible.
No full-time, part-time or casual staff had been stood down as a result of the pandemic.
"All casual employees remain important members of the Opera House’s workforce and will be offered shifts when activity resumes," she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Morrisons begins selling flour from in-store bakery following nationwide shortage</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">From banana bread to gooey brownies and sourdough, many of us have turned our hands to home baking as a way to fill our time while in lockdown.
But, as most avid bakers will have come to learn, getting hold of the basic ingredients needed to make these tasty treats is not always easy.
Flour – a key baking ingredient – has been flying off the shelves in recent weeks, with rising demand leaving many shops and supermarkets struggling to keep up with demand.
As the flour industry attempts to fulfil orders for smaller bags, Morrisons has found a way to ensure its customers do not have to go without.
This week, the supermarket has responded by decanting its own bakery flour into bags to sell in store daily.
The small bags are being made up from the larger sacks used by the in-store bakeries, with customers paying 60p for a 1kg bag of plain, self-raising or white and wholemeal bread flour.
It is also selling larger 16kg bags which cost £9, and 50g bag of bakery yeast for 20p.
So far, Morrisons has sold more than 370 tonnes of flour to Britain’s bakers and more than 19,000 bags of yeast.
Andy Clarke, bakery buying manager, at Morrisons said: “Listening to customers, we know baking is important right now to keep the family busy and entertain kids during the lockdown.
“It felt like a no brainer to give customers the ingredients they need to bake at home during this very difficult time."
Customers have been praising the supermarket on social media for making their shopping easier.
“I went to the shops today and got flour and eggs. I felt like I'd won the lottery. Thanks to the @Morrisons staff for decanting flour from their sacks into paper bags. It's the little things that cheer you up,” one person wrote on Twitter.
Another added: “There's enough to go around but not in small bags. Luckily, clever #Morrisons has come up with a solution. Hope other supermarkets follow.”
Earlier this month, the National Association of British and Irish Millers (Nabim) said the industry was “working round the clock” to double production but was still struggling to meet demand.
One flour mill in Oxfordshire said it had started running a 24-hour operation for the first time in its 25-year history to help get flour to shops.
“It’s unprecedented,” Emily Munsey, who runs Wessex Mill with her father, told the BBC. “We’ve increased production about four-fold but we’re nowhere close to meeting the demand we’ve seen.”
Alex Waugh, director general of Nabim, said the problem was not being able to mill enough flour, not that the industry lacked capacity to pack the flour into smaller bags for retailers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Indian bank bad debt could double in coronavirus crisis -sources</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MUMBAI/NEW DELHI — India expects bad debts at its banks could double after the coronavirus crisis brought the economy to a sudden halt, a senior government official and four top bankers told Reuters.
Indian banks are already grappling with 9.35 trillion rupees ($123 billion) of soured loans, which was equivalent to about 9.1% of their total assets at the end of September 2019.
“There is a considered view in the government that bank non-performing assets (NPAs) could double to 18-20% by the end of the fiscal year, as 20-25% of outstanding loans face a risk of default,” the official with direct knowledge of the matter said.
A fresh surge in bad debt could hit credit growth and delay India’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
“These are unprecedented times and the way it’s going we can expect banks to report double the amount of NPAs from what we’ve seen in earlier quarters,” the finance head of a top public sector bank told Reuters.
The official and bankers declined to be named as they were not officially authorized to discuss the matter with media.
India’s finance ministry declined to comment, while the Reserve Bank of India and Indian Banks’ Association, the main industry body, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
The Indian economy has ground to a standstill amid a 40-day nationwide lockdown to rein in the spread of coronavirus cases.
The lockdown has now been extended by a further two weeks, but the government has begun to ease some restrictions in districts that are relatively unscathed by the virus.
India has so far recorded nearly 40,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 1,300 deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.
‘RIDING THE TIGER’
Bankers fear it is unlikely that the economy will fully open up before June or July, and loans, especially those to small- and medium-sized businesses which constitute nearly 20% of overall credit, may be among the worst affected.
This is because all 10 of India’s largest cities fall in high-risk red zones, where restrictions will remain stringent.
A report by Axis Bank said that these red zones, which contribute significantly to India’s economy, account for roughly 83% of the overall loans made by its banks as of December.
One of the sources, an executive director of a public sector bank, said that economic growth had been sluggish and risks had been heightened, even ahead of the coronavirus crisis.
“Now we have this Black Swan event which means without any meaningful government stimulus, the economy will be in tatters for several more quarters,” he said.
McKinsey & Co last month forecast India’s economy could contract by around 20% in the three months through June, if the lockdown was extended to mid-May, and growth in the fiscal year was likely to fall 2% to 3%.
Bankers say the only way to stem the steep rise in bad loans is if the RBI significantly relaxes bad asset recognition rules.
Banks have asked the central bank to allow all loans to be categorized as NPAs only after 180 days, which is double the current 90-day window.
“The lockdown is like riding the tiger, once we get off it we’ll be in a difficult position,” a senior private sector banker told Reuters. (Reporting by Nupur Anand and Manoj Kumar; additional reporting by Nidhi Verma; Editing by Euan Rocha and Alexander Smith)

Indian banks are already grappling with 9.35 trillion rupees (RM531.8 billion) of soured loans, which was equivalent to about 9.1 per cent of their total assets at the end of September 2019.
“There is a considered view in the government that bank non-performing assets (NPAs) could double to 18-20 per cent by the end of the fiscal year, as 20-25 per cent of outstanding loans face a risk of default,” the official with direct knowledge of the matter said.
A fresh surge in bad debt could hit credit growth and delay India’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
“These are unprecedented times and the way it’s going we can expect banks to report double the amount of NPAs from what we’ve seen in earlier quarters,” the finance head of a top public sector bank told Reuters.
The official and bankers declined to be named as they were not officially authorised to discuss the matter with media.
India’s finance ministry declined to comment, while the Reserve Bank of India and Indian Banks’ Association, the main industry body, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
The Indian economy has ground to a standstill amid a 40-day nationwide lockdown to rein in the spread of coronavirus cases.
The lockdown has now been extended by a further two weeks, but the government has begun to ease some restrictions in districts that are relatively unscathed by the virus.
India has so far recorded nearly 40,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 1,300 deaths from Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.
‘Riding the tiger’
Bankers fear it is unlikely that the economy will fully open up before June or July, and loans, especially those to small — and medium-sized businesses which constitute nearly 20 per cent of overall credit, may be among the worst affected.
This is because all 10 of India’s largest cities fall in high-risk red zones, where restrictions will remain stringent.
A report by Axis Bank said that these red zones, which contribute significantly to India’s economy, account for roughly 83 per cent of the overall loans made by its banks as of December.
One of the sources, an executive director of a public sector bank, said that economic growth had been sluggish and risks had been heightened, even ahead of the coronavirus crisis.
“Now we have this Black Swan event which means without any meaningful government stimulus, the economy will be in tatters for several more quarters,” he said.
McKinsey & Co last month forecast India’s economy could contract by around 20 per cent in the three months through June, if the lockdown was extended to mid-May, and growth in the fiscal year was likely to fall 2 per cent to 3 per cent.
Bankers say the only way to stem the steep rise in bad loans is if the RBI significantly relaxes bad asset recognition rules.
Banks have asked the central bank to allow all loans to be categorised as NPAs only after 180 days, which is double the current 90-day window.
“The lockdown is like riding the tiger, once we get off it we’ll be in a difficult position,” a senior private sector banker told Reuters. — Reuters

    <h5 class="mb-1">Consumers' focus shifts to packaged, high-value food items amid coronavirus lockdown 2.0</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The second phase of the coronavirus lockdown saw a considerable shift in buying patterns of consumers from basic necessities to high-value items like snacks, processed food, packaged meat and frozen desserts, retailers said.
Retailers such as Future Group, Metro and Lots Wholesale said they witnessed a spike in demand for packaged food products like biscuits and noodles, resulting in an increase in the average purchase value per customer.
People also sought critical non-food products such as kitchen appliances, electrical goods, stationery and storage containers at Metro.
"Yes, the second phase witnessed a growing demand for processed food, packaged meat and frozen desserts. People are working from home. Hence, snack items, biscuits and hot beverages are also in demand amongst customers," Metro Cash & Carry India MD and CEO Arvind Mediratta told PTI.
As the restrictions started easing, customers saw they could get easy access to their daily essentials and so panic buying stopped, he added.
"Initially, customers were unsure of what the trickle down effect of the lockdown would be. Consumers started becoming vigilant and began hoarding essential commodities. There was a sense of panic.
"But gradually, everyone was made aware that all essential products will continue to be available and people will not face a shortage. Currently, there is less panic buying and more need base buying," he said.
As most people are working from home, Metro is witnessing enquiries from customers for IT products such as computers, mouse, keyboard, chargers and other accessories.
Future Group President Food & FMCG Kamaldeep Singh said in the first phase people were buying basic necessary items such as atta, pulses and sugar, but in the second phase they focussed more on food items like biscuits, noodles and pasta.
"The definition of basic necessity has changed in couple of weeks from basic foods to snacking and munching items," he said.
According to Singh, people are not willing to travel long distances, hence footfall of large format stores is down but sales of convenience stores like EasyDay have picked up considerably.
Though people are not hoarding goods, they have cravings for snacks and other items as they are staying at home, he said.
"In the second stage, people are buying products which can be cooked at home like pasta, noodles etc. Sales of frozen non-veg and home snacking and processed food have gone up to a large extent, such as French fries, baked items and ready-to-cook meals," he said.
As restaurants are closed, people are cooking many dishes at home, Singh said, adding "the trend in the second phase has shifted from pure basic essentials to instant food and snacking items."
Lots Wholesale Solutions Managing Director Tanit Chearavanont said the demand in the second phase is majorly coming from both the "food and non-food FMCG categories" as compared to commodities which had seen a spike in the initial phase of lockdown. "Overall, the average purchase value per customer has gone up," he said.
"There is a marked difference between consumer behaviour between the first phase and the second phase of lockdown. The first phase of lockdown was fuelled by panic buy resulting in bulk purchase in categories like commodities and FMCG food products. Panic buying continued for an initial 7-10 days of lockdown, slowly giving way to consumer's confidence in the availability of essential goods," he said.
Also, with the summer season kicking in, another category seeing major demand is insecticides, Chearavanont added.
According to value fashion and lifestyle products retailer V-Mart Retail, now consumers are "trusting" their retailers and have faith that goods would remain available.
"Though, we are not operating many stores but have observed a shift in the consumer buying pattern in the second phase of lockdown. Earlier, we had noticed panic buying by the customer, purchasing whatever they can do but now people are assured about availability. That trust has come and now people are purchasing as per their requirement," said V-Mart Retail Chairman and MD Lalit Agarwal.
Meanwhile, several retailers have reported an increase in sales of their private labels, which filled the gaps as supply lines from other manufacturers were disrupted.
Asked whether the trend is likely to continue, Singh said consumers in the lockdown period are brand agnostics. "Right now the consumer is not very brand conscious, he simply wants products," he said.
According to Mediratta, due to the disruption in the supply chain, there were several FMCG companies that were not able to deliver their goods as their production was interrupted, leading to a shortage of branded goods such as instant noodles.
"However, customers were not bothered even if favorite brands were not available and were happy to transition to a private label brand. This gave a lot of boost to private labels whose stocks were available locally and so their supply remained steady without hindrances," he said.
The government first imposed a 21-day nationwide lockdown on March 24 to curb the spread of coronavirus infections. On April 14, the lockdown was extended till May 3.
The government has further extended the lockdown till May 17, but with considerable relaxations based on zones.

    <h5 class="mb-1">GST audit guidelines need to be reviewed to include video conferencing, says Experts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">GST officers would have to audit and assess taxpayers via video-conferencing instead of undertaking physical visits amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the current guidelines need to be reviewed for this, according to experts.
As per the current goods and services tax (GST) audit guidelines, taxpayers have been broadly categorised into three groups based on their annual turnover -- large, medium and small.
While large and medium units are compulsorily under premises-based audits; for small units, desk-based audit has been suggested.
However, in the case of non-cooperative taxpayers or any inherent weakness of the internal control system, officers could shift back to the premises-based audit.
Last month, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) issued instructions requiring officers to hold a personal hearing in respect of customs law, central excise and service tax laws through the video-conferencing facility.
Experts said that with the audit for the financial year 2017-18, the first year in the GST regime, yet to begin, the tax officers would need to review the audit guidelines and include video conference facility along with strengthening the risk management system to flag risky cases.
PwC India Partner National Leader (Indirect Tax) Pratik Jain said GST audit and assessment for 2017-18 will start soon and the department will have to review the audit guidelines.
"The current guidelines talk about physical visits to premises of large business for say 7-8 days and conducting audit. With social distancing being a 'new normal' now, GST officials might have to explore more virtual verifications," Jain said.
The government will have to take a re-look at its risk management system and devise better ways of assessing taxpayers, he added.
AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said one segment of the CBIC, which is Customs, has already embraced the use of technology, and now it is expected that GST having more than 1.2 crore taxpayers would also introduce such facility in all the departmental functions including assessments, adjudications, appeals, and audit.
"Introducing a video-conferencing facility in all the tax laws is imperative to the business continuity plan of the economy, otherwise, this pandemic will result in inordinate delay in the delivery of justice," Mohan added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Westpac has deferred its dividend after revealing a massive 70% slump in profit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Westpac Banking Corporation has revealed a massive 70 per cent slump in first half cash profit of $993 million and elected to defer the dividend until greater clarity is known about the economic impact of COVID-19 on bad debts.
Westpac chief executive Peter King sheeted the hit to profits back to the likely cost of settling the AUSTRAC matter, its ongoing response to recommendations from the Hayne royal commission and growing projections of the cost of the virus crisis.
“This is the most difficult result Westpac has seen in many years. It is significantly impacted by higher impairment charges due to COVID-19, as well as notable items including the AUSTRAC provision,” Mr King said in a statement.
The bank stressed that its capital position remained sound following its decision to raise $2.8 billion in December last year but said it felt it was prudent not to make a distribution at this time.
“The board has deferred the decision on determining an interim dividend and no dividend will be paid in June 2020. This was a difficult decision given many retail shareholders rely on
The bank said it had been in constant dialogue with the regulator over stress testing scenarios and it had not expressed any concern about its position. The bank said it would revisit the dividend decision at some point over the year.
“Westpac remains well provisioned and capitalised. Nevertheless, the board recognises the uncertain economic and operating conditions and how these may develop over the next six months.
Westpac has also flagged the sale of several wealth assets including its superannuation and insurance operations and wealth platforms. It has created a new “specialist businesses division”, which will be led by Jason Yetton, a former head of retail banking at Westpac who returns from Commonwealth Bank.
Mr Yetton will lead a strategic review of Westpac’s sub-scale operations across superannuation, wealth platforms, investments, insurance, auto finance and the Pacific.
Mr King said “over the coming months we will conduct a detailed strategic review on the best options for these businesses.
This will include considering whether they would ultimately be more successful under different ownership.
Expectations of shareholders had been softened up in recent weeks with the bank announcing $1.4 billion in provisions including setting aside $900 million for the AUSTRAC matter and a further $2.2 billion for bad and doubtful debts with $1.6 billion set aside for COVID-19.
Before the resumption of trade on Monday morning, Westpac shares were down 49 per cent to $15.34 from their 52 week high of $30.05 reached in September last year.
Shares in the bank have been sold off heavily in the wake of the AUSTRAC money laundering scandal that saw CEO Brian Hartzer step down and brought forward the retirement of chairman Lindsay Maxsted.
The decision to pay no dividend follows a directive from the prudential regulator for banks to materially reduce or defer a decision on making distributions until the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is better known.
Last week NAB slashed its dividend to 30¢ from 83¢ while ANZ said it would defer the decision entirely.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Westpac profit slumps 70pc, defers dividend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Westpac Banking Corp has revealed a massive 70 per cent slump in first half cash profit to $993 million and elected to defer the dividend until there's greater clarity on the impact that COVID-19 will have on bad debts.
The bank has also chosen to bring forward a decision about the bank's involvement in the beleaguered wealth management sector by putting its remaining assets in a separate division as it considers exiting the sector entirely. Westpac shares fell a modest 1 per cent at the open before recovering by midday to trade 1.6 per cent higher.
Westpac chief executive Peter King sheeted the hit to profits back to the likely cost of settling the AUSTRAC matter, its ongoing response to recommendations from the Hayne royal commission and growing projections of the cost of the virus crisis.
“This is the most difficult result Westpac has seen in many years," Mr King said in a statement. "It is significantly impacted by higher impairment charges due to COVID-19, as well as notable items including the AUSTRAC provision."
The sharp downturn in the business was reflected in the banks return on equity down to 2.9 per cent from 10.4 per cent in the first half of 2019. The bank said its capital position remained sound following its decision to raise $2.8 billion in December 2019 but said it felt it was prudent not to make a distribution in June after paying investors 93c a share this time last year.
"This was a difficult decision given many retail shareholders rely on Westpac dividends," the bank said. The board had "accepted APRA’s consistent guidance on dividends and being prudent at this point in time".
UBS analyst Jonathan Mott said the result was better than expected with much of the bad news including the multibillion-dollar provisioning already known and applauded the bank for flagging its intention to exit remaining wealth assets.
"Establishment of the specialist business division (wealth management, life, auto finance, general insurance and Pacific) with strategic review to assess "appropriate ownership" is a positive, in our view, given these businesses utilised $4 billion of regulatory capital," Mr Mott said in a flash note for clients.
Good news however was in short supply in the result in which the bank’s four main divisions revealed falls in cash earnings of between 18 per cent and 63 per cent.
Consumer banking fell 18 per cent compared with the previous half on the impact of the bushfires, severe weather events and higher impairment charges.
Cash earnings at the business bank fell 46 per cent as it took an early hit from the likely fallout of the COVID-19 virus crisis.
Earnings at the institutional bank were off a whopping 63 per cent on the previous corresponding half for similar reasons while earnings in New Zealand were off 39 per cent.
The net interest margin at the bank – a key metric which shows the gap between its cost of funds and the price it charges its customers – was a rare bright spot up 1 basis point to 2.13 per cent however CFO Gary Thursby cautioned investors from seeing much improvement in the margin over the next half.
The bank said it had been in constant dialogue with the regulator over stress testing scenarios and it had not expressed any concern about its position. It will revisit the dividend decision at some point over the year; this time last year, Westpac paid an interim dividend of 94 cents per share before cutting it to 80c a share in the second half.
The decision to defer the dividend was an historic one; even during the depths of the recession in 1992, when Westpac almost collapsed, it still paid a small dividend to shareholders.
Westpac's common equity tier 1 (CET1) remained at 10.8 per cent following last year's capital raising.
"Westpac remains well provisioned and capitalised. Nevertheless, the board recognises the uncertain economic and operating conditions and how these may develop over the next six months."
Westpac has also flagged the sale of its remaining wealth assets including its superannuation and insurance operations and wealth platforms. It has created a new “specialist businesses division”, which will be led by Jason Yetton, a former head of retail banking at Westpac who returns from Commonwealth Bank after CBA abandoned plans for a wealth spin-off.
Mr Yetton will lead a strategic review of Westpac’s sub-scale operations across superannuation, wealth platforms, investments, insurance, auto finance and the Pacific. Mr King said “over the coming months we will conduct a detailed strategic review on the best options for these businesses".
"This will include considering whether they would ultimately be more successful under different ownership," he added.
Westpac has already made an effort to reduce its exposure to businesses adjacent to its core banking operations after selling the majority of its financial advice network to Viridian in March 2019 for a song.
The bank pointed to “early signs of stress” in its lending books. While loans put into deferral are not treated as being impaired under after an APRA directive, Westpac said the number of mortgages more than 90 days overdue were up 5 basis points over the half while those more than 30 days overdue were 23 basis points higher. Other consumer 90+ day delinquencies were also higher, up 25 basis points over the half.
"The full impact of COVID-19 is expected to emerge in future periods," the bank said.
Shareholders had been softened up in recent weeks with the bank announcing $1.4 billion in provisions including setting aside $900 million for the AUSTRAC matter and a further $2.2 billion for bad and doubtful debts with $1.6 billion set aside for COVID-19. Overall provisions for expected credit losses now sit at $5.8 billion.
Like ANZ and National Australia Bank last week, Westpac flagged considerable interest among its customers for deferring loans due to COVID-19. It said 105,000 Australian mortgage accounts had been put on hold, with a loan value of $39 billion, and in addition loan repayments had been deferred across 31,000 Australian business loans with a value of $8.2 billion.
On the macro-economy, it said as a base case, it expects the unemployment rate to peak at 9 per cent in June and drop to around 7 per cent by the end of the year.
House prices could fall by 15 per cent in 2020 and a further 5 per cent in 2021.
The bank is expecting a 5 per cent contraction in GDP in 2020 and credit growth in 2020 to be just 0.3 per cent. But in 2021, GDP is forecast to rise by 4 per cent.
Shares in the bank were been sold off heavily in the wake of the AUSTRAC money laundering scandal that saw CEO Brian Hartzer step down and brought forward the retirement of chairman Lindsay Maxsted.
The decision to pay no dividend follows a directive from the prudential regulator for banks to materially reduce or defer a decision on making distributions until the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is better known.
Last week NAB slashed its dividend to 30¢ from 83¢ while ANZ said it would defer the decision entirely and would make a decision possibly as late as August.

What Bloomberg’s Economists Say…
“The unlocking of the economy has started to varying degrees in different parts of the country, but the hemorrhaging of jobs will persist for at least a few more months, pushing unemployment toward 20% and in turn stifling prospects of a vigorous recovery.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Shares of Apple are poised to outperform the broader market following the company’s resilient second quarter earnings report,JPMorgan analysts said in a note published on Friday morning.
The iPhone maker was added to JPMorgan’s Analyst Focus List and called “a top pick”.
JPMorgan rates Apple as overweight and increased its price target to $US350 from $US335, representing potential upside of 19 per cent based off of Apple’s closing price on Thursday of $US293.80.
The bank thinks “investor positioning ahead of the upcoming 5G cycle” will benefit the shares going forward, and gave six reasons why Apple shares should outperform.
JPMorgan’s $US350 price target is derived from a sum-of-the-parts valuation based on its December 2021 earnings-per-share estimate of $US16.80 and a blended price-earnings ratio of 21. Shares of Apple were up as much as 1.7 per cent in Friday morning trades to $US299.00.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Altria: 8.6% Dividend Yield With 35%+ Re-Rating Potential</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
Introduction
We are reiterating our Buy rating on Altria (MO), having reviewed our investment case after Q1 2020 results released on Thursday. Since we upgraded our rating to Buy on February 1 ("Altria: E-Vapor Threat Reversed In Q4, Upgrade To Buy"), shares have lost 15.7% (after dividends), roughly in line with the S&P 500 index:
Buy Case Recap
Our Buy rating is based on what we saw as an asymmetric risk/reward where:
Q1 2020 Group P&L Headlines
Altria's headline results for Q1 2020 are shown below. Including the effects of inventory moves and an extra trading day, Net Revenues After Excise were up 15.0% year-on-year, Operating Companies Income ("OCI") was up 19.5%, Net Income was up 17.3%, and EPS was up 18.3%:
Altria delivered a strong OCI performance in both its Smokeables and Oral Tobacco segments, which together account for almost the entire group OCI:
The Smokeables segment saw cigarette volume growing 6.1% year-on-year, Net Revenues After Excise growing 16.0% and OCI growing 20.1%:
The unusual increase in cigarette volumes was due to inventory moves and an extra trading day, with the former strongly influenced by consumers "pantry loading" in the initial weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak and will reverse later.
Cigarettes Business Continues to Stabilise
Excluding the benefits of consumer "pantry loading" and an extra trading day, Altria's cigarette volume fell 5.0% year-on-year. This marks a further deceleration from previous quarters, which management attributed entirely to a smaller “cross-category movement” (primarily to e-vapor and oral tobacco):
The threat to Altria from Reduced Risk Products ("RRP") continues to recede.
E-vapor category volume in the U.S. fell 12% sequentially and 10% year-on-year in Q1 2020, with Juul's market share dropping further (to 39% of volume, from 43% in Q4 2019). These figures imply a 21% sequential volume decline for Juul volume and a 6.6% sequential volume decline for other e-vapor products:
U.S. e-vapor has been heavily impacted by the regulatory clampdown since August 2019, including a FDA ban on almost all flavored e-vapor pods (apart from tobacco and menthol) since January (Juul had started to voluntarily withdraw such products earlier from October). Altria's investment in Juul is being challenged by the FTC, but the situation is likely to remain unchanged for the “2 or 3 years”, while the two sides contest the case in court.
As a result of this clampdown, Altria has seen the number of U.S. smokers increase recently, as older smokers who had previously moved to e-vapor now return to cigarettes, albeit disproportionately benefiting the discount category. As Altria's CEO explained on the call:
The oral tobacco category is seeing volume growth in the U.S., with 6-month volume up 5% year-on-year as of Q1 2020, but this is no threat to Altria as it continues to have a larger-than-50% market share:
The category includes traditional moist smokeless tobacco and snus, as well as the newer oral nicotine pouches, but Altria has competitive products in all these. The category is still limited in size. For example, for Altria, this generated $601m of revenues (before excise) in Q1 2020, compared to the $5.61bn generated by cigarettes and cigars in the Smokeables segment.
In Heat-Not-Burn ("HNB"), Altria holds the exclusive U.S. license for the market-leading IQOS product from Philip Morris (PM), whose marketing is in any case hindered by COVID-19, with stores in its 2 launch markets (Atlanta and Richmond) now closed, interactive marketing paused, and the launch in its third launch market (Charlotte) now delayed. British American Tobacco (BTI) (referred here as "BAT"), which has the only other credible HNB product, is not yet actively marketing it in the U.S., partly because it continues to believe the U.S. to be primarily an e-vapor market.
Stable Future Earnings
At Q1 2020 results, Altria withdrew its EPS guidance for both 2020 and 2020-22. However, this is not a cause of concern, being the direct result of COVID-19 and temporary in nature. The withdrawal is also at least partly due to Altria's 10% holding in Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) ("ABI"), whose beer business is far more at risk from COVID-19, and withdrawing 2020-22 guidance simply followed from the withdrawal of the 2020 one. As Altria's CEO explained:
The challenges at ABI is of only marginal impact to Altria. We believe only 5-10% of Altria's equity value is attributable to ABI, as we primarily value companies on their equity Free Cash Flow ("FCF"), and ABI's contribution to Altria's $6.9bn FCF in 2019 is limited to $396m in dividends.
As for COVID-19, we do not expect Altria to be completely unimpacted, especially if federal or state tobacco taxes are increased. Looking at past recessions as a guide, in 2009, Altria's cigarette volume fell 10.5% year-on-year, and Smokeables revenues fell 4.4%, mainly due to the Federal Excise Tax being hiked from $0.39 to $1.01 per pack from April 2009. While Smokeables OCI growth was maintained in that period with cost cuts, there may be less scope of this now:
However, with the threat from RRPs receding, we believe cigarettes will remain a stable business in the medium term, capable of generating low-single-digit EPS growth for Altria. As we showed in our illustrative calculations in our last article, provided cigarette volume declines are no worse than 5% a year, even with a lower-than-historic 4% annual price/mix benefit, lower excise and lower variable costs from lower volumes would mean that OCI could continue to grow at about 2%, Net Income at 1.5-2.5%, and EPS at 2.5-3.0%.
Reaffirmed Commitment to Dividends
Altria management reaffirmed its commitment to the dividend, stating that “our objective continues to be a dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS”, and that the 2020 dividend will reflect "our strong cash generation and the strength of our balance sheet".
Altria's dividend currently costs about $6.2bn each year, and is 1.2x covered by its $7.6bn of (normalised) FCF in 2019:
Its Net Debt/EBITDA of 2.2x, down 0.1x during the quarter, also provides further flexibility to maintain the dividend.
BAT Trading Update Read-Across
A positive read-across also came from BAT's pre-AGM trading update, issued on the same day as Altria's Q1 2020 results, with BAT "confirming" its high-single-digit EPS growth outlook for 2020. BAT also referred to COVID-19 having only “limited impact on consumer demand” and “strong price mix, with pricing in line with our plan” so far. With 40-45% of BAT's profits coming from the U.S. market, and 75% of its global revenues from developed markets, its observations are highly applicable to Altria.
Valuation & Peer Comparison
At $39.25, on 2019 financials, Altria's shares are on a 9.2x P/E and a 10.4% FCF yield; the dividend yield is 8.6% ($3.36 per share).
Altria is the second cheapest stock among the tobacco Big 4 on most valuation metrics, apart from the structurally challenged Imperial Brands (OTCQX:IMBBY) ("IMB"). (We have Buy ratings on BAT and Philip Morris as well.)
Altria's dividend cover of 1.2x (based on FCF) is slightly lower than BAT's (1.4x) and Philip Morris' (1.3x), but Altria has a lower debt load and does not face the same currency headwinds they do.
Conclusion
Operationally, Altria continues to progress in line with our investment case, with the core cigarette business further stabilising. COVID-19 can be a headwind but a temporary one; and a low-growth economy would increase Altria's attraction relative to other stocks.
In our Base Case, with volume declines no worse than 5% each year, we believe Altria could grow its EPS by at least low single digits annually. With a dividend yield of 8.6%, and the share price growing in line with EPS, investor returns will be more than 10% on an annualised basis.
In our Bull Case, Altria would realise its upward re-rating potential, from investor sentiment on cigarettes improving and/or it demonstrating strong growth in RRPs. If the shares re-rate upwards to a dividend yield of 5.5-6.5%, the share price can return to the $55-65 range seen in 2018, leading to a 35-60% upside. If this were to take place 12 months from now, then the total return would be 45-70% once dividends are included.
At $39.25, this presents an attractive asymmetric risk/reward. We reiterate our Buy rating.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">UAE – Mubasher: The spokesperson of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) announced that the company has gradually relaunched operations at the Ruwais oil refinery complex, according to Reuters.
The UAE's largest refinery with a capacity of 835,000 barrels per day was shut down at the beginning of 2020 due to maintenance works.
"We are gradually restarting our refining operations in Ruwais following our planned maintenance programme," the spokesman told Reuters.
Noteworthy to highlight, in February 2018, ADNOC announced that the company has been investing around $3.1 billion to upgrade its Ruwais oil refinery to enhance the flexibility of Murban grade’s production.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During the probe, it was found that these entities were connected and indulged in manipulating the price of the scrip downwards through a complex web of accumulating and distributing shares in the off-market
Sebi has imposed a total penalty of Rs 1.05 crore on 21 entities for executing fraudulent trading in the scrip of Jolly Plastic Industries Ltd.
The regulator had conducted an investigation in the scrip of Jolly Plastic Industries Ltd between February 2012 and November 2014.
During the probe, it was found that these entities were connected and indulged in manipulating the price of the scrip downwards through a complex web of accumulating and distributing shares in the off-market.
Thereafter, executing market transactions among themselves at lower circuit filters price to bring down the price to facilitate certain entities to acquire shares at a lower price for various manipulative purposes.
Besides, they contributed to negative LTP (last trading price) by executing trades at lower circuit price every day.
The entities by trading amongst themselves below the LTP in the scrip manipulated and created a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip by such trade, the regulator noted.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sebi imposes total Rs 1.05 crore fine on 21 entities in Jolly Plastic Industries case</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: Sebi has imposed a total penalty of Rs 1.05 crore on 21 entities for executing fraudulent trading in the scrip of Jolly Plastic Industries Ltd.
The regulator had conducted an investigation in the scrip of Jolly Plastic Industries Ltd between February 2012 and November 2014.
During the probe, it was found that these entities were connected to each other and indulged in manipulating the price of the scrip downwards through a complex web of accumulating and distributing shares in the off-market.
Thereafter, executing market transactions among themselves at lower circuit filters price in order to bring down the price to facilitate certain entities to acquire shares at lower price for various manipulative purposes.
Besides, they contributed to negative LTP (last trading price) by executing trades at lower circuit price every day.
The entities by trading amongst themselves below the LTP in the scrip manipulated and created a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip by such trade, the regulator noted.
Hence, the entities by indulging in fraudulent trade practices have violated the provisions of the PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations.
The regulator has levied a fine of Rs 5 lakh each on 21 entities -- Aavia Buildtech, Aavia Softech, Accurate Buildwell, Aglow Financial Services, Anchal Goel , Ashok Kumar Jain HUF, Ashvin Verma, Bluechip Fincap Serve, Capital Securities, Century Buildmart, Lalit Mohan Gupta , Laxmikant Gaggar, Kanchan Bastimal Jain, Mould Trading, Ocean Share Brokers, Poonam Mittal, Ram Kumar Goyal, Steady Capital Advisory Services, Sure Portfolio Services, Surya Medi Tech, and Usha Jaiswal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why the European stock market’s losing to the US in this rally</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Once again, when stocks rally, it’s Europe that’s left behind.
With the S&P 500 about 30% above its March lows, the Stoxx 600 index has lagged behind with a 21% bounce, despite having fallen more than the U.S. in the global selloff sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.
The reason? For starters, there’s the market’s makeup: Europe has a large presence of cyclical sectors, such as banks and energy, which have underperformed during this crisis. On top of that, the region has led the recent wave of dividend cuts by major companies. Investors have also been disappointed by the scale of fiscal and monetary support measures as Europe faces its deepest recession in living memory.
The rebound in stocks around the world has been driven by companies with reliable earnings growth and solid balance sheets as investors seek safe havens amid slowdown fears. The U.S. technology sector has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend, with the five biggest names such as Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. constituting 18% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, more than double the value of the U.K. FTSE 100 Index and five times larger than Germany’s DAX, according to Sanford C. Bernstein data.
“In order for Europe to take the lead regionally, we really need a rotation into more cyclical and value areas of the market,” Nathan Thooft, Manulife Investment Management’s head of global asset allocation, said by email. “I am not convinced we have the necessary level of economic clarity for that to happen.”
And although Thooft, who is overweight U.S. equities, sees “decent value” in European stocks in the longer term, he says the market lacks a catalyst. Earnings in the Stoxx 600 companies are projected to slump 23% in 2020, compared with a 19% contraction in the S&P 500, Bloomberg data show. The euro-area economy could shrink as much as 12% this year and fail to return to its pre-coronavirus size until the end of 2022, the European Central Bank says.
While the ECB and major European economies, including Germany, the U.K. and Italy, have been stepping up support measures to help consumers and companies weather the slump, investors feel that the U.S. has acted swifter and pumped more money into the system.
“The fiscal response in the U.S. has been so big relative to everybody, that’s a big piece of how the recovery is going to look in terms of who comes out stronger on the back of this,” Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio strategist and manager at Natixis Investment Managers, said by phone. “And that’s why you’ll continue to see the U.S. outperform.”
Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., agrees with this sentiment, but at the same time said on Bloomberg TV that once market players get more confident about “a genuinely strong” recovery in activity, European stocks can outperform.
GRANOLASThe Goldman team this week released a list of European companies, dubbed GRANOLAS and which include GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Roche Holding AG and ASML Holding NV, that can beat the market during the next cycle thanks to their strong balance sheets, stable growth and good dividend yields. The strategists, including Guillaume Jaisson, point out that while 20 years ago Europe’s ten biggest companies were telecoms and oil firms, these along with banks are now absent from the top stocks by market value and the tech sector has grown to exceed energy, rising closer in size to the banking subgroup.
Still, the European stock market has been held back by last month’s historic slump in the oil price, which also weighed on mining shares. And the region’s banks continue to be hurt by low interest rates and increased concerns about corporate defaults.
European firms have been much swifter in slashing or suspending dividends than their U.S. counterparts, with at least 189 companies in Europe’s Stoxx 600 benchmark having canceled or postponed payouts. Part of the reason is that the ECB has recommended that lenders delay dividends in response to unprecedented support measures while certain governments, like France, have made it a clause in receiving state aid.
“Most investors entering Europe are chasing dividends,” Roland Kaloyan, head of European equity strategy at Societe Generale SA, said by phone. “And now, Europe is losing its key appeal because of all the dividend cuts over the last several weeks. Yes, it’s great news for the bond holders, but not for the shareholders.”
SocGen is overweight credit and underweight stocks in the region.
Investor flows also show little love toward European stocks, even though the Stoxx 600 gauge just had its biggest monthly bounce since 2015. The region’s stock funds had their largest outflows in six weeks of $2.7 billion in the week through April 29, according to Bank of America Corp. data, adding to a year-to-date toll of about $24 billion.
“The U.S. will likely lead the rest of the world until we start to see expectations and signs that global growth differentials begin to narrow in favor of the rest of the world,” Manulife’s Thooft said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The number of breweries has stalled for the second year in a row as growth in the craft beer sector slows after a period of explosive growth, a new study suggests.
Accountancy group UHY Hacker Young said the total had fallen by one over the last year to 2,273 amid increased competition from multinational brewers, and a trend away from drinking beer among younger generations.
Multinationals have increased their market share by launching their own craft beer varieties, as well as acquiring many of the emerging independent craft breweries, said the report.
UHY Hacker Young predicted the craft beer market may be reaching “saturation point” among its existing core customer market.
James Simmonds of UHY Hacker Young, said: “Stalling growth in the number of UK breweries is not the whole story, with the UK remaining one of the world leaders in craft beer.
“In order to help the sector bounce back as quickly as possible from coronavirus, the Government should consider expanding the Small Brewer Relief to include a wider group of breweries.
“An increase in the level of business rate relief for brewers and pubs would also be welcome.
“Brewers should make use of this support available to them to scale up their online platforms, in order to increase their online sales directly to customers.
“Consumer habits are likely to change even after the lockdown has ended, and brewers need to be able to capitalise on where consumers are now looking to buy their goods.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Terminus' Technologies Going Overseas, Bringing the Light of Intelligence to Cities</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING, May 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The current wave of globalization is fuelled by new ICT technologies such as 5G, AI, Internet of things and big data. The development of cutting-edge technologies is not only a reflection of the concrete strength of a country and a region, but also an increasingly critical production factor for promoting social and economic development. In particular, given the current COVID-19 pandemic across the globe, technologies have been playing a vital role in preventing and controlling its spread. Terminus is an epitome of China's new tech companies that exports its technologies to battle against the pandemic.
As the leading company of the "new technology" sector of China Everbright Group and the core strategic technology platform of China Everbright Ltd (CEL), Terminus has been fully applying its AI and Internet of Things technologies in China, and receiving positive feedback from the market. Meanwhile, more acknowledgment from abroad are saying high of Terminus' corporate responsibility as an international company.
Blueprint for AI CITY
What Terminus has been doing is to build AI CITY one after another around the world, and gather numerous "points of aggregation" of AI CITY into a complete AI CITY "plane" through the iteration of AIOT technologies. From point to plane, Terminus will be able to deploy its global network of AI CITY.
In the Middle East, by cooperating on projects and inviting investment, the United Arab Emirates is bringing the world's leading tech enterprises into the country, hoping to go smart and be powerful in the future with the help of the imported advanced productivity. Terminus is one of the leading tech companies on top of its list. By far, Terminus has reached an agreement with Injazat Data System on the smart city project. The cooperation will focus on smart city, energy, intelligent security among other fields, enabling the two sides to jointly explore the blue ocean market in the UAE and the Middle East. Look deeper, you will find this business partner of Terminus is supported by Mubadala Development Company, the world's largest sovereign investment fund. Such a cooperation is the best illustration of a company's tech strength and its ability to go global.
▲ Terminus and Injazat Data System reaching a consensus on smart city cooperation and signing the project agreement
However, this is only a glance at Terminus' market reach and its AI CITY deployment in the UAE.
Last year, Terminus signed a cooperation agreement with District 2020 Dubai Expo Special Zone, under which Terminus will provide AIOT solutions in intelligent security, energy, smart city, etc. In addition, Terminus will set up an AIOT industrial R&D center, as well as its incubators and accelerators, in District 2020 Dubai Expo Special Zone to fully utilise local AIOT industrial resources and expand its industrial layout.

In April this year, China Everbright Group AI Industrial Base officially started its construction in Chongqing, a metropolis in southwest China. It is the first world-class AI CITY created by Terminus and China Everbright. It can be said that Terminus has sketched its grand vision for global AI CITY in Chongqing, and undoubtedly, the multiple AI CITY projects in the UAE are the early stage deployment of the company's global network.
Fighting the pandemic with technologies has expanded the company's global reach.
At the critical stage of the global fight against coronavirus, Terminus' Huolei Initiative has entered its 100th day. It has been upgraded from a simple aid initiative to a two-way communication and assistance platform for the international community to prevent and control the pandemic. Terminus' successful experience in fighting the pandemic with technologies has become a "hard currency" in the overseas market. Not only has it received thumb-up from the Minister of State and formed an alliance with Qatar Airways, but also implied a close tie with Qatar to promote high-quality development. This also brings Terminus an increasing attention from the international community.
As early as the beginning of April, pandemic control supplies were offered by Terminus to the Qatar authorities. By collaborating with Qatar Airways, Terminus was able to send tech products for pandemic control to the country, including back-end control system for pandemic control, all-in-one portrait recognition and thermometer, early warning instrument with thermal imaging temperature screening, thermal imaging thermometer, etc. They were immediately sent to government bodies and ports of Qatar upon arrival, bringing great convenience to the frontline battle for fighting with the coronavirus.
His Excellency Akbar Al Baker, Minister of State of Qatar, Secretary General of the Qatar National Tourism Board, and CEO of Qatar Airways Group, wrote a special letter to Victor Ai, CEO of Terminus. Not only did he delivered the sincere gratitude, but also expressed his commitment to fight against the coronavirus together with Terminus, which as he described, was a precious ally. On 20th last month, His Excellency Ahmad Mohammed A Y Al-Sayed, Minister of State of Qatar and Chairman of the Qatar Free Zone, also sent a letter to Victor Ai, showing Qatar's deep solicitude for the Chinese people in fighting the pandemic, and strongly affirming the heroic performance of Terminus in its Huolei Initiative.
As the world's leading provider of intelligent scene solutions, Terminus has made substantial achievements in AI, data service, smart city construction and other fields. As early as last November, on his trip to China for the 2nd China International Import Expo, Ahmad Sayed, Minister of State of Qatar, also visited Terminus' office in Shanghai with the company of Mohamed Al-Dehaimi, Ambassador of Qatar to China. Back then in the office, the Minister of State said that he had not thought that China's tech companies were far ahead of other countries in intelligent technologies, and that Qatar was willing to conduct in-depth cooperation with Terminus in the related industries.
At this special moment, Terminus has taken concrete actions to expand the tech cooperation between China and other countries to minimize the impact of the pandemic and seek new opportunities. The flourishing project launches at home and abroad have shown the world the great resilience of China's economy. Behind Terminus' AI CITY, it lies the truth that China is bringing new opportunities to and other countries in the form of "new infrastructure", and adding confidence to the stable development of global economy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Terminus' Technologies Going Overseas, Bringing the Light of Intelligence to Cities</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING, May 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The current wave of globalization is fuelled by new ICT technologies such as 5G, AI, Internet of things and big data. The development of cutting-edge technologies is not only a reflection of the concrete strength of a country and a region, but also an increasingly critical production factor for promoting social and economic development. In particular, given the current COVID-19 pandemic across the globe, technologies have been playing a vital role in preventing and controlling its spread. Terminus is an epitome of China's new tech companies that exports its technologies to battle against the pandemic.
As the leading company of the "new technology" sector of China Everbright Group and the core strategic technology platform of China Everbright Ltd (CEL), Terminus has been fully applying its AI and Internet of Things technologies in China, and receiving positive feedback from the market. Meanwhile, more acknowledgment from abroad are saying high of Terminus' corporate responsibility as an international company.
Blueprint for AI CITY
What Terminus has been doing is to build AI CITY one after another around the world, and gather numerous "points of aggregation" of AI CITY into a complete AI CITY "plane" through the iteration of AIOT technologies. From point to plane, Terminus will be able to deploy its global network of AI CITY.
In the Middle East, by cooperating on projects and inviting investment, the United Arab Emirates is bringing the world's leading tech enterprises into the country, hoping to go smart and be powerful in the future with the help of the imported advanced productivity. Terminus is one of the leading tech companies on top of its list. By far, Terminus has reached an agreement with Injazat Data System on the smart city project. The cooperation will focus on smart city, energy, intelligent security among other fields, enabling the two sides to jointly explore the blue ocean market in the UAE and the Middle East. Look deeper, you will find this business partner of Terminus is supported by Mubadala Development Company, the world's largest sovereign investment fund. Such a cooperation is the best illustration of a company's tech strength and its ability to go global.

However, this is only a glance at Terminus' market reach and its AI CITY deployment in the UAE.
Last year, Terminus signed a cooperation agreement with District 2020 Dubai Expo Special Zone, under which Terminus will provide AIOT solutions in intelligent security, energy, smart city, etc. In addition, Terminus will set up an AIOT industrial R&D center, as well as its incubators and accelerators, in District 2020 Dubai Expo Special Zone to fully utilise local AIOT industrial resources and expand its industrial layout.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LUSAKA — Glencore’s Zambian subsidiary Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) will resume mining operations for 90 days but still expects to go ahead with its initial plan to place its mining operations on care and maintenance, the local firm said on Sunday.
Glencore’s original announcement that it planned to put MCM under “care and maintenance” sparked a backlash from Zambia’s government, which threatened to revoke the firm’s mining licenses saying it had not given enough notice.
Mopani said in a statement that constructive discussions had taken place with the Zambian government.
“During the 90-day period, Mopani will continue to engage with the government on potential solutions to its current challenges,” the statement said.
It said the health and safety of the workforce and surrounding communities was a top priority and Mopani would engage with its employees, relevant contractors and local communities regarding the restart of operations.
Mines ministry permanent secretary Barnaby Mulenga said Glencore had told the government last month that it wanted to keep operating its Zambian copper mining subsidiary Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) rather than shutter operations. (Reporting by Chris Mfula; Editing by Edmund Blair)

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRUSSELS -- In a country that claims to be the real birthplace of the finger food that Americans have the temerity to call French fries, rescuing the potato industry might easily be a matter of Belgian national pride.So while a coronavirus lockdown keeps restaurants, bars and many of Belgium's 5,000 frites stands closed, the trade association for the national potato industry is calling on the population at large to do its part by keeping deep fryers fired up on the home front."Traditionally, Belgians eat fries once a week, and it's always a festive moment," Romain Cools, the Belgapom secretary general, said in a phone interview on Tuesday. "Now, we are asking them to eat frozen fries twice a week at home."The demand for frozen potatoes has nosedived in recent weeks, and the Belgian industry faces a possible loss of 125 million euros ($135.5 million) if hundreds of tons of surplus potatoes don't move this year, Cools said."This is the first time in my 30-year career that I need to call on authorities for help," he said. "The potato sector is so important. It should be helped because it's a flagship for our whole industry."As the immediate future remains gloomy, the industry wants to find new ways to move its surplus stock and avoid aste. In partnership with the Dutch-speaking Flemish region of Belgium, Belgapom has set up a program to deliver 25 tons of potatoes a week to food banks. Businesses are working to export some of their supplies to Central Europe and Africa, where the demand remains high.The industry is also looking at ways to work with starch factories to find other uses for excess potato stocks, such as feeding livestock or producing green electricity.Both France and Belgium claim to have invented fried string potatoes as a side dish. But the 'pomme frites" culture is stronger in Belgium, where people share a taste for beer with the chip-eaters in Britain.Belgians eat 38 kilograms (about 84 pounds) of fresh potatoes and 6-7 kilograms (13-15 pounds) of processed potatoes at home every year, according to Belgium's National Union of Fry-makers. But even if consumers unite in upping per capita consumption of fries, the potato sector won't emerge from the pandemic unscathed.Before the coronavirus reached Europe, the 2020 prospects looked bright for Belgium's potato industry, the world's largest exporter, following a 7.5% rise last year in the production of frozen fries. But the virus outbreak halted exports to China, then triggered a slowdown of potato sales across Europe as lockdown measures were implemented.After supermarkets saw shoppers grab all the potatoes they could hoard, demand quickly plummeted and kept falling with the closure of fast-food chains, according to Belgapom.The outside shacks known as "fritkoten" where Belgians queue up day in and day out in normal times to buy their beloved fries, were allowed to remain open for takeaway orders during the national lockdown, but an estimated 80% stayed closed anyway after local authorities offered compensation for shuttered businesses.Pascal Vandersteegen, the manager at Chez Clementine, a popular fritkot in the south of Brussels, says he has witnessed a 30% loss in revenue because of restrictions imposed to address the virus."Now, we have to close at 10 p.m. every day," he said. "We used to finish work at 1.30 a.m., and 6 a.m. on Fridays. But we are an institution. It's been 30 years that we are here. If everybody closes, there won't be anything left."

But the virus outbreak halted exports to China, then triggered a slowdown of potato sales across Europe as lockdown measures were implemented.
After supermarkets saw shoppers grab all the potatoes they could hoard, demand quickly plummeted and kept falling with the closure of fast-food chains, according to Belgapom.
The outside shacks known as "fritkoten" where Belgians queue up day in and day out in normal times to buy their beloved fries, were allowed to remain open for takeaway orders during the national lockdown, but an estimated 80% stayed closed anyway after local authorities offered compensation for shuttered businesses.
Pascal Vandersteegen, the manager at Chez Clementine, a popular fritkot in the south of Brussels, says he has witnessed a 30% loss in revenue because of restrictions imposed to address the virus.
"Now, we have to close at 10 p.m. every day," he said. "We used to finish work at 1.30 a.m., and 6 a.m. on Fridays. But we are an institution. It's been 30 years that we are here. If everybody closes, there won't be anything left."

    <h5 class="mb-1">'A buying spree of epic proportions': How the Federal Reserve bucked precedent and forever changed its role in the US economy, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Federal Reserve is no longer the central bank it used to be.
In a matter of weeks, the steadily expanding US economy slipped into its worst recession in nearly a century. Tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs, spending froze, and credit health tanked. While the Fed’s response began with its traditional financial-crisis playbook – pushing interest rates to the floor and buying Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities – a shift was brewing.
Then, on March 20, the monetary authority’s role changed. The Fed announced it would begin buying corporate bonds for the first time in its 107-year history, offering aid for cash-strapped businesses large and small. That facility marked a paradigm shift to the central bank’s code and separated the Fed from its originally intended role in the US economy.
“The big concern is that the line between the function of the Fed and the Treasury is getting blurred,” Bruce Mizrach, professor of economics at Rutgers University, said, adding past bailouts, commercial or municipal, were handled by the latter and not the former.
He added: “That’s a larger function than what was envisioned for the Fed, and once you assume those responsibilities, it then becomes harder to back away.”
Until the financial crisis, the Fed’s primary tool was its benchmark interest rate. When the 2008 meltdown hit and rates were pushed to zero, the Fed turned to the purchase of mortgage-backed securities and other unconventional assets.
To combat the coronavirus downturn the central bank expanded its toolbox once more. The Fed’s corporate bond purchases were initially exclusive to investment-grade debt before an expansion incorporated so-called fallen angels, companies that recently slipped from high-quality ratings to junk status.
“The use of high-yield purchases is designed explicitly to say, ‘look, if you were an investment-grade company before March 223 and you got downgraded because of COVID, that shouldn’t have happened,'” Lauren Goodwin, economist at New York Life Investments, said in an interview.
The Fed’s own leaders have acknowledged the shift, with Dallas branch president Robert Kaplan telling Fox Business on Friday that the bank’s role includes serving as “a lender of last resort.”

Still, experts worry that the move into risky debt purchases will make an eventual recovery more turbulent than usual. The Fed doesn’t want to be seen as impeding market dynamics, but its move from stable Treasury bonds to corporate credit has already changed valuations across the board.
In the days following the Fed’s March 23 announcement, corporate bonds retraced sharp declines. The stock market enjoyed an indirect boost, as investors viewed the policy as a strong backstop for risk assets.
“The problem with official intervention in markets is you’re no longer letting the market determine prices. So what is the right valuation?” Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Mellon, said, adding “the possibility that the Fed will broaden the scope of its interventions” is even affecting prices in sectors ineligible for Fed lending.
Even if market valuations normalize and account for the Fed’s policy, closing its facilities in the wake of the economic downturn will drive violent price swings all over again, Goodwin warned.
“The rollback of these programs and the timing of that rollback is going to be an enormous focus for investors and it will absolutely prompt market volatility,” she said.
Where some are worried about the scope of the Fed’s latest measures, others point to their size as a serious long-term risk.
Through quantitative easing programs from 2010 to 2015, the Fed’s balance sheet roughly doubled to $4.5 trillion. It took until September 2019 to unwind about $800 billion from its balance sheet, yet the subsequent repo crisis and coronavirus pandemic undid four years of progress in a matter of weeks. From February 24 to April 27, the Fed added another $2.5 trillion to its balance sheet.
The race to pad markets resulted in “a buying spree of epic proportions,” JPMorgan economists wrote in a Tuesday note. The central bank’s purchases show no signs of stopping, with five of its nine lending facilities yet to begin operations. Experts expect the Fed’s holdings to land between $7 trillion $10 trillion by the end of the year, dwarfing the expansion seen during the financial crisis.

Reversing the balance sheet explosion poses its own threat. Shrinking it before the economy has stabilized could drive price volatility and impede the Fed’s efforts to avoid market influence, Reinhart said. He also noted that acting too late puts the environment at risk of deflation, where prices stop increasing at a healthy rate.
The central bank must also gain approval from the Treasury to close its lending facilities, and the department’s leaders may decide against pulling back on corporate aid.
“Facilities are going to be tough to unwind and they will linger. They are going to wait until it’s absolutely the case that the economy is on solid footing and the expansion is underway,” Reinhart said.
There’s still hope among experts that the Fed can return to its independent, market-independent state. Much of the Fed’s emergency measures were made at the behest of Congress and the Treasury. Placing the onus on elected officials leaves the Fed and its appointed leaders from venturing too far out of its historic jurisdiction, Goodwin said.
“If you think this is a huge overstep and you’re worried about free markets, it’s really important to know this isn’t just the Fed acting on its own,” Goodwin said.
He concluded: “The next crisis will probably look different. What policymakers have shown is not only that they can be creative in addressing an acute market functioning issue … but that they’re willing to adapt and adjust the policies as necessary.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett says coronavirus cannot stop America</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">REUTERS: Warren Buffett on Saturday (May 2) gave an upbeat assessment of the United States' ability to withstand crises, even as he acknowledged that the coronavirus pandemic could have a wide range of impacts on the economy and his investments.Buffett opened the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway in Omaha, Nebraska with 1-3/4 hour of remarks in which he tried to soothe shareholders as the pandemic batters the global economy and hurts even his own conglomerate.Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, the 89-year-old billionaire called dealing with the pandemic "quite an experiment" that had an "extraordinarily wide" range of possible economic outcomes.But he said Americans have persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression, and the "American tailwind" would help them do it again."Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it," Buffett said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett says coronavirus cannot stop America, despite huge Berkshire loss</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett on Saturday gave an upbeat assessment of the United States’ ability to withstand crises, even as he acknowledged that the coronavirus pandemic could have a wide range of impacts on the economy and his investments.
Buffett opened the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc in Omaha, Nebraska with 1-3/4 hour of remarks in which he tried to soothe shareholders as the pandemic batters the global economy and hurts even his own conglomerate.
Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, the 89-year-old billionaire called dealing with the pandemic “quite an experiment” that had an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible economic outcomes.
But he said Americans have persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression, and the “American tailwind” would help them do it again.
“Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it,” Buffett said. “I will bet on America the rest of my life.”
The meeting was held virtually for the first time without shareholders because of the pandemic and streamed by Yahoo Finance.
It began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75 billion first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealized losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America Corp and Apple Inc during the market meltdown.
While quarterly operating profit rose 6%, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, and Berkshire said some of its more than 90 businesses are facing “severe” negative effects from COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Buffett said operating earnings will, through at least this year, be “considerably less” than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.
Berkshire’s cash stake ended the quarter at $137.3 billion, reflecting difficulty in finding good places to invest.
He also said he decided that he “made a mistake” investing in U.S. airlines, and that this accounted for some of the net $6.1 billion of stocks that Berkshire sold in April.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines, Chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company’s annual meeting.
The conglomerate held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines and about 9% stakes in both United Airlines and Southwest Airlines Co at the end of 2019, according to its annual report.
Airline stocks have been hard hit by the near collapse U.S. travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Buffett said Berkshire had invested around $7 billion or $8 billion amassing stakes in the four airlines including American Airlines Group Inc.
“We did not take out anything like $7 or $8 billion and that was my mistake,” Buffett said. “I am the one who made the decision.”
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the sales.
“It is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up…. It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” Buffett added.
The meeting is devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.”
Buffett, after the initial presentation, started to answer shareholder questions at the meeting.
He was joined by Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, who has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive officer.
Abel is standing in for longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Buffett to answer shareholder questions.
Buffett said Munger is in “fine shape” and looking forward to attending Berkshire’s 2021 annual meeting.
Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire’s insurance businesses and is also a possible CEO candidate, did not attend either. Abel lives closer to Omaha than Munger and Jain.
Shareholders elected former American Express Co Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault to Berkshire’s board, making him the company’s first African American director.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ATF price slashed 23%, costs one-third of 'frozen' petrol, diesel rates</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jet fuel (ATF) prices have been slashed by a steep 23 per cent in line with a slump in international oil prices and it now costs about one-third of petrol and diesel whose rates continue to be frozen for the 50th day on Sunday.
Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) price has been cut by Rs 6,812.62 per kilolitre, or 23.2 per cent, to Rs 22,544.75 per kl in the national capital, according to a price notification by state-owned oil marketing companies.
ATF, which is used as a fuel in aeroplanes, now costs less than one-third of the price of petrol used in cars and two-wheelers. A litre of petrol in Delhi comes for Rs 69.59 while jet fuel is priced at Rs 22.54 per litre.
Diesel, used mostly in trucks, buses and tractors, is priced at Rs 62.29 per litre.
In fact, even market priced or non-subsidised kerosene is much cheaper than petrol and diesel after its rates were cut 13.3 per cent to Rs 39,678.47 per kl (Rs 39.67 per litre), according to the notification.
This the steepest cut ever and sixth reduction in ATF prices since February.

Since February, jet fuel prices have been cut by almost two-thirds. ATF price in Delhi before the reduction cycle began in February was Rs 64,323.76 per kl and now costs Rs 22,544.75 per kl.
Similar reduction has been effected in other metro cities as well.
While the oil PSUs have regularly revised ATF prices, they have since March 16 kept petrol and diesel prices on hold ostensibly on account of extreme volatility in the international oil markets.
Petrol and diesel prices were frozen soon after the government raised excise duty on the two fuels by Rs 3 per litre each to mop up gains arising from falling international rates.
Oil companies, instead of passing on the excise hike to consumers, decided to adjust them against the reduction required because of the drop in international oil prices. They used the same tool and did not pass on the Re 1 per litre hike required for switching over to ultra-clean BS-VI grade fuel from April 1.
Market analysts, however, said the same volatility was witnessed in ATF prices as well but that has not stopped the oil companies from passing on the cut to airlines.
More importantly, no airline has been operating since mid-March in view of restrictions placed to check the spread of coronavirus, yet oil companies have continued to revise downward jet fuel prices.
In fact, oil companies used to revise ATF prices on the 1st of every month but they on March 21 adopted fortnightly revisions to pass on the benefit of falling international oil prices to the airlines.
Even non-PDS or market priced kerosene cost has seen rate reduction similar to ATF. It was priced at Rs 65,815.47 per kl in January.
Though the government had deregulated petrol and diesel prices, rate changes have been in the past put on hold by public sector oil companies Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for reasons that appear to be non-commercial.
ALSO READ: Fuel sales slump 50% in April; petrol down 64%, diesel 61%, ATF 94%
There was a 19-day price freeze on petrol and diesel ahead of the Karnataka polls in May 2018 despite international fuel prices going up by nearly USD 5 a barrel. However, no sooner were the elections over, they rapidly passed on to customers the desired increase -- over 16-straight days post-May 14, 2018, petrol price climbed by Rs 3.8 per litre and diesel by Rs 3.38.
Similarly, they had stopped revising fuel prices for almost 14 days ahead of the assembly elections in Gujarat in December 2017.
These companies had also imposed a freeze on petrol and diesel prices between January 16, 2017, and April 1, 2017, when assembly elections in five states -- Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur -- were held.
During the 2019 general elections, they moderated the revision by not passing on all of the desired increase in rates to consumers, industry sources said. And rates began to rise a day after the final phase of polling for Lok Sabha elections ended.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The commerce and industry ministry is working to identify certain key sectors -- like capital goods, leather and chemicals -- with a view to establish India as a manufacturing hub, according to sources.
Several meetings have taken place with stakeholders, including industry chambers, to identify those sectors which have the potential to become global winners and make India a strong manufacturing hub, sources said.
"There are 12 champion sectors which can be looked upon. These include modular furniture, toys, food processing like ready-to-eat food, agrochemicals, textiles like man-made fibers, air conditioners, capital goods, pharma, and auto components," one of the sources said.
Groups and sub-groups have been constituted on the matter by engaging representatives from industry chambers like CII and Assocham.

Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal has recently stated that in the post-Covid era, there is going to be a perceptible change in the global supply-chains, and Indian industrialists and exporters should be looking to capture significant share in the world trade.
He has said that the ministry is working on identifying the specific sectors which can be taken forward in the immediate future for the purpose of the export.

The manufacturing sector contributes about 15 per cent in the country's economy and the government is aiming to increase it significantly.
The output of eight core infrastructure industries shrank by a record 6.5 per cent in March due to significant dip in production of crude oil, natural gas, fertiliser, steel, cement, and electricity amid the coronavirus lockdown.
Exports too contracted by a record 34.6 per cent in March on account of the lockdown due to Covid-19 outbreak.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Commerce Ministry working to identify key sectors for making India a manufacturing hub</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: The commerce and industry ministry is working to identify certain key sectors -- like capital goods, leather and chemicals -- with a view to establish India as manufacturing hub, according to sources.
Several meetings have taken place with stakeholders, including industry chambers, to identify those sectors which have the potential to become global winners and make India a strong manufacturing hub, the sources said.
"There are 12 champion sectors which can be looked upon. These include modular furniture, toys, food processing like ready-to-eat food, agro-chemicals, textiles like man-made fibres, air conditioners, capital goods, pharma and auto components," one of the sources said.
Groups and sub-groups have been constituted on the matter by engaging representatives from industry chambers like CII and Assocham.
The core group would identify specific implementable policy based on issues like technological capability, employment potential, and global as well as domestic demand, they added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">CBN suspends banks from sacking staff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) have suspended the ongoing staff layoffs by some banks in the country.
The apex bank corporate communications director Isaac Okorafor made the disclosure in a statement on Sunday.
“In order to help minimize and mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families and livelihoods, no bank in Nigeria shall retrench or lay-off any staff of any cadre (including full-time and part-time),” Okorafor said.
This is coming after a few banks have resorted to lay off staff and also cut down staff salaries.
Nigeria’s Access Bank Plc is one of the banks planning to cut staff salaries to avoid laying off as coronavirus continues to ravage the world and affect global economies, Bloomberg reported.
Bloomberg on Friday reported that “people with direct knowledge of the matter” said the pay cuts are expected to start from May unless business conditions improve.
Apart from the coronavirus troubles which forced many banks to close some of their branches and allow staff to work from home, crash of oil prices and the threat of another naira devaluation pose a great threat of rising bad-debt levels for banks.
To avoid the economic crisis on the bank, CBN said there will be a review the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nigerian banking industry after their special committee meeting.
The committee, the CBN noted “deliberated on the issue of the operating costs of banks in view of the disruptions emanating from the global economic difficulties.”
Okarafor stated that “the express approval of the Central Bank of Nigeria shall be required in the event that it becomes absolutely necessary to lay-off any such staff.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">BREAKING: CBN stops banks from retrenching workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has ordered all banks not to retrench workers.
A statement from the apex bank signed by Mr. Isaac Okorafor Director, Corporate Communications said the CBN, Bankers’ Committee decided to suspend lay-offs in banks.
Access Bank has been trending in the media after an alleged video of a town hall meeting between the Managing Director of the bank Herbert Wigwe and the staff.
In the video, Wigwe was heard informing staff of the bank that some contract staff of the bank will be laid off while other staff will have their salaries cut.
Following the backlash that greeted the video, the CBN on Sunday stated: “In order to help minimise and mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families and livelihoods, no bank in Nigeria shall retrench or lay-off any staff of any cadre (including full-time and part-time).”
This decision the CBN said was taken “following special meeting of the Bankers’ Committee on May 2, 2020, to further review the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nigerian banking industry.”
The Committee, the CBN noted “deliberated on the issue of the operating costs of banks in view of the disruptions emanating from the global economic difficulties.”
At the end of the deliberations, it was also decided that “the express approval of the Central Bank of Nigeria shall be required in the event that it becomes absolutely necessary to lay-off any such staff.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Who's Ready for a 24% Cut to Social Security Benefits?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Every month, more than 64 million people receives a Social Security benefit check, of which roughly 70% are retired workers. For these retirees, 62% lean on their payout to account for at least half of their income, with 34% reliant on Social Security for a whopping 90% to 100% of their incoming funds. It's been estimated by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that, without Social Security, elderly poverty rates would more than quadruple in the United States.
In other words, Social Security is not only the most successful social program in existence, but it's indispensable.
It also happens to be a program that's in pretty serious trouble -- and the hole lawmakers have dug for it keeps deepening.
A little more than a week ago, the Social Security Board of Trustees released its annual report on the financial health of the program. It examines both the short-tem (10-year) and long-term (75-year) outlook for Social Security, as well as tackles what variables could help or hinder the program, such as changes in economic growth, interest rates, fiscal policy, birth rates, death rates, and net immigration. As has been the case for years, the latest report shows that things are getting worse for our most-storied social program.
In the latest report, perhaps the one "positive" was the view of the Trustees that 2021, not 2020, would represent the first year of net cash outflows from the program since 1982. Then again, I'd bet the house that this forecast is wrong given that the Trustees haven't taken into account the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in their short-range forecast. With over 26 million people losing their jobs, and unemployment benefits exempt from the payroll tax, there's no chance, in my opinion, that the program generates a cash surplus in 2020.
Then there are the negatives. The Trustees are still counting on the program to burn through its nearly $2.9 trillion in asset reserves (i.e., its net cash surpluses built up since inception) by 2035. This is the same expectation published in last year's report.
However, the cash shortfall beyond 2035 grew substantially due to a number of modeling adjustments implemented by the Trustees. While expenditures tied to the Disability Income Trust should actually come in lower than prior expectations over the long-term, new modeling lowered the real interest rate by 20 basis points to 2.3%, reduced consumer price inflation by 20 basis points to 2.4%, and lowered the total fertility rate to 1.95 births per women from 2.0. All told, this pushed the projected cash shortfall to $16.8 trillion between 2035 and 2094, up $2.9 trillion from last year's projection of $13.9 trillion.
If lawmakers fail to act to strengthen Social Security, the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust will only be able to pay 76% of benefits after 2035. Put in another context, retired workers and survivors, which respectively make up 45.5 million and 5.9 million of the 64.5 million current beneficiaries, as well as future retirees, would see their payouts reduced by 24%.
You might be asking yourself how a social program that's been paying out benefits without a hitch for more than 80 years could dig itself a $16.8 trillion hole? The answer can't be pinned on just one factor. Rather, it's a confluence of factors that've built up over time.
For example, baby boomers often get pinned for this mess given that they're retiring from the workforce in greater numbers and driving down the worker-to-beneficiary ratio. But boomers being born is far from the only reason Social Security will soon be outlaying way more than it collects every year.
For one, we're living significantly longer now than we were when the program first began paying benefits in 1940. But while the average life expectancy at birth has risen more than 16 years for the average American over the last eight decades, Social Security's full retirement age -- the age where you become eligible to receive your full monthly payout, as determined by your birth year -- will have risen only two years, as of 2022. In other words, increased longevity is allowing the average 65-year-old to receive a benefit check for 20 years, and it's clearly straining the program.
Another problem is declining birth rates, which the Trustees somewhat adjusted in their newest model. Births per women in the U.S. have plunged to an all-time low, with millennials waiting longer to get married, gaining easier access to contraceptives, and having fewer unplanned pregnancies. If this lower birth trend continues, the worker-to-beneficiary ratio will fall even more.
Immigration rates are another culprit. The fact is that Social Security relies on a healthy annual net immigration rate into the United States. Immigrants tend to be younger, which means they're likely to contribute in the labor force via the payroll tax for decades to come. But over the past 20 years, net immigration into the U.S. has been on a pretty steady decline.
Also, don't overlook growing income inequality as a fault. Since the rich often have few if any financial constraints when it comes to paying for preventative care, medical care, and prescription medicines, they're living substantially longer than low-income individuals who may not have this same access to medical care and prescriptions. Thus, even though Social Security is designed to protect low-income Americans during retirement, it's really putting cash into the pockets of well-to-do Americans for a longer period of time.
However, the biggest of the more than half-dozen issues plaguing Social Security just might be the inaction of lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
You see, Congress has known since 1985 that Social Security wasn't going to generate enough cash over the following 75 years to maintain its payout schedule. For 35 years, Congress has known that some form of intervention, be it outlay reductions or additional revenue, would be needed to help strengthen the program. And yet, they've mostly twiddled their thumbs in Washington, D.C., over that time frame.
Mind you, ideas on how to fix Social Security aren't the issue. Each political party has a core solution that would, in some way, make Social Security a stronger program. Democrats prefer raising additional revenue by increasing or removing the payroll tax earnings cap, thereby requiring the well-to-do to pay more into the system. Meanwhile, Republicans prefer gradually increasing the full retirement age to reduce lifetime outlays to future retired workers.
The problem is that, since both solutions work, neither party feels the need to cede an inch to find common ground with their opposition. But the longer lawmakers wait to fix the problem, the more burdensome the eventual cost will be on working Americans. In just a few years, the long-term cash shortfall has ballooned from $11.4 trillion to $16.8 trillion -- and it's liable to continue climbing the longer Congress waits to act. 
History shows that lawmakers do act in a bipartisan manner at the 11th hour when it comes to Social Security, but that's not going to do much to allay retirees' fears about the possibility of a 24% cut to benefits in just 15 years.

Since the rich often have few if any financial constraints when it comes to paying for preventative care, medical care, and prescription medicines, they're living substantially longer than low-income individuals who may not have this same access to medical care and prescriptions. Thus, even though Social Security is designed to protect low-income Americans during retirement, it's really putting cash into the pockets of well-to-do Americans for a longer period of time.
However, the biggest of the more than half-dozen issues plaguing Social Security just might be the inaction of lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
You see, Congress has known since 1985 that Social Security wasn't going to generate enough cash over the following 75 years to maintain its payout schedule. For 35 years, Congress has known that some form of intervention, be it outlay reductions or additional revenue, would be needed to help strengthen the program. And yet, they've mostly twiddled their thumbs in Washington, D.C., over that time frame.
Mind you, ideas on how to fix Social Security aren't the issue. Each political party has a core solution that would, in some way, make Social Security a stronger program. Democrats prefer raising additional revenue by increasing or removing the payroll tax earnings cap, thereby requiring the well-to-do to pay more into the system. Meanwhile, Republicans prefer gradually increasing the full retirement age to reduce lifetime outlays to future retired workers.
The problem is that, since both solutions work, neither party feels the need to cede an inch to find common ground with their opposition. But the longer lawmakers wait to fix the problem, the more burdensome the eventual cost will be on working Americans. In just a few years, the long-term cash shortfall has ballooned from $11.4 trillion to $16.8 trillion -- and it's liable to continue climbing the longer Congress waits to act. 
History shows that lawmakers do act in a bipartisan manner at the 11th hour when it comes to Social Security, but that's not going to do much to allay retirees' fears about the possibility of a 24% cut to benefits in just 15 years.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SINGAPORE — The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade deal is still on track to be signed by the end of 2020, Singapore’s Minister of Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said on Sunday.

“If India is unable to rejoin the discussions in the coming month, then plans will continue to proceed with the legal scrubbing for the preparation for the siging at the end of the year,” Chan told reporters.
“At this point in time we are still on track for the signing by the RCEP countries at the end of the year,” he added.
Chan was speaking to reporters on Sunday to outline plans to restart Singapore’e economic activity after curbs put in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Separately he said troubles at Hin Leong Trading Pte Ltd, one of Asia’s top oil traders, were not a reflection of the wider situation in the Singapore oil trading market. However, he said the wider oil trading market will be hurt by global oversupply issues. (Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan in Singapore; Editing by Michael Perry)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Q4 performance shows consumer, digital are now RIL's new core businesses</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reliance Industries’ consolidated performance for the March quarter (Q4) may be disappointing, but experts are bullish on the stock and believe shareholders should subscribe to its rights issue.
The challenges posed by demand disruption in core refining, petrochemicals and even retail businesses are likely to continue but the strong growth in Jio Platforms — comprising digital businesses — and deleveraging initiatives should create shareholder value in the long run, experts say.
In largest refining and marketing business, per barrel gross refining margin (GRM) at $8.9 was slightly lower than $9.2 seen in Q3, but washigher than $8.2 a year ago. The Street was expecting GRMs of up to $8, with benchmark Singapore GRM averaging $1.2 in Q4 — the lowest in 17 years. RIL, however, accounted for inventory loss associated with steep decline in crude prices, under exceptional items. Thus, standalone profits adjusting for this, were below analysts estimates.
“RIL has recorded non-cash inventory loss of Rs 4,250 crore, which, if adjusted (like normally done for oil marketers), would result in inventory loss of $4.4 per barrel during Q4. Thus, the core GRM stands at $4.5,” analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities (MOSL) said.
Petchem, now the third-largest revenue and profit contributor, continued to see impact of lower realisations and supply disruptions, and its performance fell short of expectations with profit down 22.4 per cent sequentially (42.8 per cent yoy) in Q4.
Organised retail has been growing, but Q4 revenues and profits were hit by lockdown, and could only grow 4 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, year-on-year (led by essential product sales). It may take a while before it can rebound to revenue and Ebit run-rate of 25 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively, seen in FY20.
The highlight of Q4 was the digital business (Jio Platforms), where revenue grew 26.6 per cent and pre-tax profit grew by 127 per cent, on a y-o-y basis, as Jio's subscriber base grew ahead of expectations to 387.5 million (versus 370 million in Q3 and 306.7 million a year ago). Average revenue per user (ARPU) at Rs 130.6 was up about 2 per cent sequentially. Better traction is expected as analysts such as Probal Sen at Centrum Broking expect the full impact of tariff hikes taken earlier to flow in the coming quarters.
Interestingly, together, Jio and retail saw their share in RIL's Ebitda increase to 38.6 per cent in Q4, up from 35.8 per cent in Q3 and 29.1 per cent in the year-ago period. And, as these numbers rise, the two are seen as RIL's new core businesses.
Jio’s improving show should also support RIL's overall valuation, at a time when outlook for other businesses remains challenging. “We value RIL at Rs 1,618 per share (earlier Rs 1,589) based on sum-of-the-parts with equity values of Rs 358 (earlier Rs 353) for core business, Rs 500 (earlier Rs 450) for Reliance Retail and Rs 760 (earlier Rs 750) for Jio,” analysts at MOSL said.
Edelweiss Securities is more optimistic on telecom performance and pegs RIL's FY21 Ebidta growth at 15 per cent.
Besides Jio, the balance sheet deleveraging is crucial. Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas, said the capital restructuring will boost longer term prospects for investors. RIL is raising Rs 1.04 trillion through its Facebook deal worth Rs 43,574 crore, investment by BP, and the country’s largest rights issue of Rs 53,125 crore (its first in three decades).
The rights issue priced at Rs 1,257 per share is at 14.3 per cent discount to Thursday's closing price of Rs 1,467.
While the Street was expecting a bigger discount, experts say the company’s due diligence on valuations it expects to garner from fresh investments in various businesses and recent Facebook deal must have influenced the pricing.
Promoters committing to 50 per cent and any unsubscribed rights issue instigates confidence. Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities, highlights that there are very few equity investment opportunities in current environment and investors need to pay only 25 per cent at time of subscription so can consider investing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Korean conglomerates’ net income halves: FTC</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Fair Trade Commission Sunday added five more business groups to its list of corporations with total assets of 5 trillion won ($4.1 billion) or more to its watch list, but said the firms’ net profits had almost halved since last year.According to FTC Sunday, the business groups suffered a 48.1 percent on-year plunge in net income in 2019, from 92.5 trillion won to 48 trillion won, citing sluggish sales in semiconductors and petroleum products The groups’ total revenue dipped from 1,422 trillion won to 1,401.6 trillion won in the same period. Meanwhile, the Korean economy’s dependence on the top five chaebol groups -- Samsung, Hyundai Motor, SK, LG and Lotte -- has reduced. Though they respectively accounted for 54 percent, 57.1 percent, and 72.2 percent in total assets, revenue and net income among the 64 business groups in 2018, those figures dropped to 52.6 percent, 55.7 percent and 68.5 percent in 2019. Five business groups -- Hyundai Merchant Marine, Sinokor Merchant Marine, IMM Investment, KG and Samyang -- have newly joined the corporate watch list, which now includes 64 business groups and their 2,284 affiliates. The total assets of HMM, Sinokor Merchant Marine, IMM Investment, KG and Samyang are 6.5 trillion won, 6.4 trillion won, 6.3 trillion won, 5.3 trillion won and 5.1 trillion won, respectively.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Relief sought for poultry sector</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAHORE: The Ministry of National Food Security and Research has given a proposal to facilitate the country’s emerging poultry sector, which is bearing the brunt of Covid-19 pandemic just like other sectors.
In a document prepared by the ministry, it has urged the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) to delay bank instalments and mark-up on the loans availed by the poultry sector for one year – a scheme which would require approximately Rs4.7 billion.
The proposal was made after the government of Pakistan announced a relief package of over Rs1.2 trillion to aid the economy in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.
Out of this package, an amount of Rs100 billion has been earmarked to provide relief to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the agriculture sector.
It remains unclear whether the poultry sector will be accommodated under the package announced for small business or not. Under the said package, the government will facilitate commercial users and pay their three months’ electricity bills.
Officials from Pakistan Poultry Association (PPA) seem to be unaware of the recent development from the food ministry as they claimed that they were already in contact with concerned authorities to help pay off three months’ electricity bills of control sheds.
“This amount (Rs4.7 billion) is meant to support the country’s poultry sector to pay off their three months’ electricity bills and it is not aimed at delay in loans and interest repayments,” insisted PPA General Secretary Javaid Bukhari while talking to The Express Tribune.
Chicken meat is the most popular protein diet for Pakistani masses as its cost is largely within the reach of the majority of people.
Unlike mutton (red meat) which does not fall within the affordability of middle and lower middle class, the rates of white meat hover at an average of Rs200 per kilogramme. Sometimes, the price of per kg chicken falls even lower than some of the major pulses consumed in Pakistan.
Chicken meat has attracted many small and medium scale investors in the past who invested in control sheds and other forms of poultry farming. According to PPA, currently there are around 18,000 poultry farms in Pakistan with an annual turnover of Rs1.1 trillion which has decreased to Rs800 billion due to Covid-19.
Some stakeholders said that the recent move of the food ministry would not benefit farmers because the majority of them had not availed any loan facility.
“Many farmers convert their life-long savings into poultry investments to secure their future,” said a stakeholder on condition of anonymity. “The proposal of food ministry can benefit some industrial groups who are dealing with poultry feed or have a complete supply chain since they are running industries and have availed the lending facilities.”
The official detailed that establishing a poultry farm is a one-time investment with a few running expenses which a farmer can manage by selling his stock.
It would be much better for farmers if the ministry could devise a policy, which might lower the prices of poultry feed either by direct subsidy or through the exemption of duties on different raw materials.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stimulus all set to unfurl</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Daily Star / ANN
 
Government agencies and banks have almost completed their preparations to implement 18 stimulus packages worth Tk 95,619 crore to tackle the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.
The packages, equivalent to 3.3 percent of the country's GDP, will be implemented under the supervision of Bangladesh Bank and the finance ministry.
In line with the BB's instructions, banks will give out Tk 77,750 crore of the total amount in the form of soft loans to large, medium and small businesses in the industrial and service sectors, and growers and entrepreneurs in the farm sector.
The central bank has launched six refinance schemes to allow lenders to smoothly implement the credit programmes under the stimulus packages.
Under the six schemes, banks will disburse funds among the affected businesses and farmers, and then the BB will reimburse them the bulk of the money. The banks will have to pay the BB back after recovering money from borrowers.
 
The BB will provide around Tk 51,000 crore to the lenders under the refinance schemes. This means the lenders will have to give loans of Tk 26,750 crore from their own sources.
The Daily Star contacted a number of banks, which said they have almost completed the preparations to disburse loans under the schemes.
Since the enforcement of the nationwide shutdown on March 26, banks have been facing a cash crunch as many depositors withdrew money amid coronavirus scare. They now have to take the BB's funds to continue their lending activities, said the managing directors of the banks.
Every bank has to sign participation agreements with the BB to get funds under the schemes. Some cash-strapped lenders have already done it, they mentioned.
They also said the banks would start disbursing loans to export-oriented industries this week for paying workers' wages for April as the BB already gave the lenders Tk 2,000 crore from a Tk 5,000 crore stimulus package.
M Kamal Hossain, managing director of the Southeast Bank, said both the central bank and the finance ministry have taken prompt measures to implement the stimulus packages.
"We have already signed a participation agreement to get funds from one of the refinance schemes. The other agreements will be signed soon," he mentioned.
Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, said banks may start using the soft funds from the central bank by this month as many of them have acted promptly and submitted applications to the BB.
Seeking anonymity, a BB official said 41 banks have so far signed participation agreements with the central bank under the refinance scheme worth Tk 5,000 crore for small and medium entrepreneurs in the farm sector.  
"We hope banks will start giving loans within a week or two, as the central bank will disburse the required funds in the quickest possible time," added the official.
Banks will get funds under the scheme at 1 percent interest rate, and lend those to borrowers in the farm sector at 4 percent interest rate.
Under the Tk 30,000 crore package for large industries and the service sector, Sonali Bank, the country's biggest lender in terms of loan disbursement and deposit mobilisation, has already sanctioned loans of Tk 1,000 crore to Biman Bangladesh Airlines at 9 percent interest rate.
The state-run bank will get an interest subsidy of 4.50 percent from the BB for the loans.
Under 11 other stimulus packages, the government will provide Tk 17,866 crore in the form of budgetary support to the underprivileged people, farmers and the government employees infected with the coronavirus.
Farmers will be provided with fertilisers, machinery, fuel and electricity at subsidised prices under one of the packages involving Tk 9,500 crore.
The government will also give Tk 2,000 as cash support to each of the 50 lakh urban families hit hard by the nationwide shutdown.
Those engaged in the informal labour sector -- mostly manual labourers, mechanics, construction workers, rickshaw-pullers, street vendors and restaurant employees -- will be eligible for the cash support, said Shah Kamal, senior secretary at the disaster management and relief ministry.  
"Our ministry has prepared a list of such people based on information collected by the offices of the deputy commissioners, upazila nirbahi officers and city corporations across the country. We will submit the list to the Prime Minister's Office on May 4."
The government also has a plan to provide food assistance to 1.25 crore families under various programmes, Kamal said.
The public employees, infected with the virus, will get Tk 5 to Tk 10 lakh based on their pay scales.
Experts say the BB has to be proactive in implementing the stimulus packages as the central bank of a country plays a pivotal role in containing the economic fallout during a recession.
Talking to The Daily Star, Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute, said the BB will have to take prompt measures to implement the refinance schemes which will give a lifeline to the moribund economy.
The BB should share the credit risk and offer the lenders a loan guarantee scheme to encourage them to disburse loans, he said.
Otherwise, many banks will be reluctant to disburse loans out of fear that the loans will become defaulted given the poor economic outlook, Ahsan pointed out.
He further said the government should come up with a package ranging from Tk 25,000-Tk 30,000 crore to provide cash support to the marginal people. It will help boost their capacity to purchase goods.
"This will also help create demands for products and offset the ongoing deflationary trend at the same time."
Many countries such as the US, Chile, Malaysia and Singapore have already injected a large amount of the money into their economies, he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India’s coronavirus lockdown curbs buffalo meat exports, hitting Ramadan supplies</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For more than a decade Kuala Lumpur street vendor Abu Zahrim Ismail has seen brisk sales of daging dendeng, a spicy buffalo meat jerky, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
But this year, the spread of coronavirus pandemic has slashed shipments of Indian buffalo meat, driving prices higher and hitting sales.
Most meat processing plants in India, the world’s second largest beef exporter and Malaysia’s top supplier, have been shut as the South Asian nation fights to contain the pandemic.
“The virus has really turned everything upside down,” Abu said.
India typically sells more than 100,000 tonnes of buffalo meat every month, but in March exports dropped to around 40,000 tonnes, according to two exporters.
Sales are likely to have been even lower in April as widespread lockdowns took effect, and even in May are expected to remain well below normal despite some parts of the Indian economy re-opening, they added.
“Right now things are not going in favour of our industry. Even though it is food, it is not considered essential as it is for exports,” said one of the exporters who is based in northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
“As of now all the exporters are trying to move their current stocks that they are holding.”
Wholesale prices of frozen buffalo meat in Malaysia have climbed 15%-20% from a year ago this month during the Ramadan festival, which usually accounts for up to 20% of the country’s annual consumption as families gather to break fast.
“Typically, Malaysians would consume about 350 containers of buffalo meat a month from India, now it has fallen to half,” said one importer based in Kuala Lumpur.
Diminished retail demand during Malaysia’s own lockdown has also hit overall meat import demand.
“We are only open for takeaway during the movement control order. Sales have dropped about 80%,” said Indian Muslim Restaurant Operators Association (Presma) president Ayub Khan.
GLOBAL MEAT MESS
In 2019, India shipped close to 1.5 million tonnes of beef, which is sourced largely from dairy buffalos, compared with 2.3 million tonnes sold by top supplier Brazil, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The absence of those supplies is being acutely felt in Malaysia, which relies on India for 70% of beef imports, as well as in Indonesia where a quarter of imports come from India and buffalo is popular among lower income groups due to its low cost.
Indonesian buyers - which were expected to buy 170,000 tonnes of Indian beef this year before virus-led delays kicked in - are trying to switch to other origins like Brazil and Argentina, industry sources in Jakarta said.
But the global Covid 19 pandemic has made replacing those lost supplies difficult, especially after the world’s biggest meat companies, including Smithfield Foods Inc, Cargill Inc, JBS USA and Tyson, halted operations at about 20 slaughterhouses and processing plants in North America after workers fell ill.
Number one beef exporter Brazil has also been hit, with meat processor BRF registering 18 COVID-19 cases in late April at an industrial hub that employs about 3,100 people.
RESTRAINED REBOOT
Indian meat processors are keen to restart plants once restrictions are eased, but enduring social distancing measures mean it will not be easy to source animals in the usual way.
Dairy cattle in India are sent for slaughter after they have passed their productive prime, with agents from meat plants typically going house-to-house to buy up animals that are then trucked to abattoirs.
Animal markets - banned or greatly restricted in scale under lockdown - are also a key source.
“Questions remain over how quickly raw material can be procured and processed following all rules of social distancing,” an official at All India Meat & Livestock Exporters Association, told Reuters.
Exporters, importers and association officials were not willing to be named because of the sensitivity over food supplies.
The net effect of disrupted supplies from India will mean lower overall meat imports into cost-sensitive markets around Asia, said J.Y. Chow, food and agriculture expert at Mizuho Bank in Singapore.
“The supply is getting disrupted, so any substitute will need to be sourced from an upgrade, and it will thus erode volume demand. No other country sells buffalo meat in the volumes that India does.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla falls after Elon Musk's 2018-style tweets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York | Tesla shares plunged after Elon Musk said the electric-carmaker's stock is too high in a stream of tweets reminiscent of the posts that securities regulators sued him over in 2018.
The chief executive posted more than a dozen times in a span of less than a 75 minutes on Friday, claiming he's selling "almost all" of his physical possessions and won't own a house. He also renewed his call for reopening the economy.
Hours later, Tesla's head of human resources for North America told employees that furloughs would be extended at least another week. The carmaker's shares fell 10 per cent to close at $US701.32 ($1091.50).
Mr Musk, 48, told the Wall Street Journal in an email that he wasn't joking and his tweets weren't vetted before he posted them. Tesla's stock is still up 68 per cent for the year, an advance that's put him in position to meet the final performance threshold he needs to receive stock options that would yield a windfall of about $US730 million.
"We view these comments as tongue-in-cheek and it's Elon being Elon," Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst with a hold rating on Tesla, said in an email. "It's certainty a headache for investors for him to venture into this area as his tweeting remains a hot-button issue."
Mr Musk's Twitter burst followed a profane rant during Tesla's first-quarter earnings call. He railed against shutdown orders aimed at containing the coronavirus, telling analysts he was worried about not being allowed to reopen the company's assembly plant in Fremont, California. He compared shelter-in-place measures with forcible imprisonment.
"Musk is frustrated, and he has a pattern when he's under pressure to turn to Twitter," Gene Munster, a managing partner at Loup Ventures. "It's his form of therapy. But he also has an agenda, which is to get the Fremont factory back open."
Tesla's environmental, health, and safety team has been working "non-stop" on procedures to facilitate the return to work, Valerie Capers Workman, the North American human resources chief, said in an email to staff. San Francisco Bay area counties have extended their stay-home orders through to the end of May.
In December, Mr Musk joked about Tesla's stock being "so high" when it climbed above $US420. That's the price at which he said Tesla would go private in 2018, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission said he picked the number to make a marijuana-related joke that would impress his girlfriend.
On Friday, Mr Musk said his girlfriend, the musician Grimes, is now mad at him. They have a baby due this week, he wrote.
Mr Musk and Tesla each paid $US20 million to settle the securities fraud lawsuit the SEC brought in September 2018 over the CEO's tweets claiming that he had the funding to take Tesla private. But the dispute carried on into last year after Mr Musk posted that the company would make roughly 500,000 cars in 2019 without advance approval from a Tesla lawyer.
The two sides amended their earlier agreement that aimed to set limits on his tweeting by adding specific topics that Mr Musk isn't supposed to post about without pre-approval. The subjects include the company's financial condition, potential mergers or acquisitions, production and sales numbers, new or proposed business lines, projections and forecasts that haven't been previously published, and Mr Musk's purchase or sale of Tesla securities.
While Mr Musk's statements may have run afoul of the SEC agreement, the agency might not reopen the case against him, according to Harvey Pitt, a former SEC chairman who now leads the advisory firm Kalorama Partners.
"The SEC has bigger fish to fry," Mr Pitt said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
Mr Musk has made similar comments before about Tesla's stock being overvalued. In May 2017, when Tesla had a roughly $50 billion market capitalisation, the CEO said it was higher than the company deserved.
"We can only guess at motivations behind his sequence of tweets," Ben Kallo, a Robert W. Baird analyst, said in a note to clients. He has a $700 price target for Tesla's stock but warns that there could be "significant uncertainty over the next 2-3 quarters" regarding the company's efforts to restart production.
When asked if he was selling his possessions because he needed cash or was protesting, Mr Musk responded that the answer was neither. He's long sought to reach Mars with his rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp, and is devoting himself to that effort, and to the Earth, he wrote.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla falls as Musk says stock too high in 2018-style tweets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tesla Inc. shares plunged after Elon Musk said the electric-car maker’s stock is too high in a stream of tweets reminiscent of the posts that securities regulators sued him over in 2018.
The chief executive officer posted more than a dozen times in a span of less than a 75 minutes Friday, claiming he’s selling “almost all” of his physical possessions and won’t own a house. He also renewed his call for reopening the economy.
Hours later, Tesla’s head of human resources for North America told employees that furloughs will be extended at least another week. The carmaker’s shares fell 10% to close at $701.32.
Musk, 48, told the Wall Street Journal in an email that he wasn’t joking and his tweets weren’t vetted before he posted them. Tesla’s stock is still up 68% for the year, an advance that’s put him in position to meet the final performance threshold he needs to receive stock options that would yield a windfall of about $730 million.
Explained: Why Elon Musk’s tweet on Tesla stock price is problematic
“We view these comments as tongue-in-cheek and it’s Elon being Elon,” Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst with a hold rating on Tesla, said in an email. “It’s certainty a headache for investors for him to venture into this area as his tweeting remains a hot-button issue.”
Musk’s Twitter burst followed a profane rant during Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. He railed against shutdown orders aimed at containing the coronavirus, telling analysts he was worried about not being allowed to reopen the company’s assembly plant in Fremont, California. He compared shelter-in-place measures with forcible imprisonment.
“Musk is frustrated, and he has a pattern when he’s under pressure to turn to Twitter,” Gene Munster, a managing partner at Loup Ventures, said by phone. “It’s his form of therapy. But he also has an agenda, which is to get the Fremont factory back open.”
Tesla’s environmental, health, and safety team has been working “non-stop” on procedures to facilitate the return to work, Valerie Capers Workman, the North American human-resources chief, said in an email to staff seen by Bloomberg News. San Francisco Bay area counties this week extended their stay-home orders through the end of May.
In December, Musk joked about Tesla’s stock being “so high” when it climbed above $420. That’s the price at which he said Tesla would go private in 2018, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said he picked the number to make a marijuana-related joke that would impress his girlfriend.
On Friday, Musk said his girlfriend, the musician Grimes, is now mad at him. They have a baby due on Monday, he wrote.
Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million to settle the securities-fraud lawsuit the SEC brought in September 2018 over the CEO’s tweets claiming that he had the funding to take Tesla private. But the dispute carried on into last year after Musk posted that the company would make roughly 500,000 cars in 2019 without advance approval from a Tesla lawyer.
The two sides amended their earlier agreement that aimed to set limits on his tweeting by adding specific topics that Musk isn’t supposed to post about without pre-approval. The subjects include the company’s financial condition, potential mergers or acquisitions, production and sales numbers, new or proposed business lines, projections and forecasts that haven’t been previously published, and Musk’s purchase or sale of Tesla securities.
While Musk’s statements may have run afoul of the SEC agreement, the agency might not reopen the case against him, according to Harvey Pitt, a former SEC chairman who now leads the advisory firm Kalorama Partners.
“The SEC has bigger fish to fry,” Pitt said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Musk’s opinion probably falls within the subject matter that must be preapproved by a securities lawyer. Yet there’s an argument that the opinion is based on past results.
Musk has made similar comments before about Tesla’s stock being overvalued. In May 2017, when Tesla had a roughly $50 billion market capitalization, the CEO said it was higher than the company deserved.
“We can only guess at motivations behind his sequence of tweets,” Ben Kallo, a Robert W. Baird analyst, said in a note to clients. He has a $700 price target for Tesla’s stock but warns there could be “significant uncertainty over the next 2-3 quarters” regarding the company’s efforts to restart production.
When asked if he was selling his possessions because he needed cash or was protesting, Musk responded the answer was neither. He’s long sought to reach Mars with his rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., and is devoting himself to that effort, and to the Earth, he wrote.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Live From Omaha, It’s Warren Buffett on Saturday Night</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s what we all needed to hear: “Nothing can stop America” — Warren Buffett’s way of saying, “We will get through this.” 
Saturday evenings aren’t normally the ideal time for tuning into a multi-hour investor conference, especially after being cooped up all week working from home due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But mere minutes into the live-streamed Berkshire Hathaway Inc. annual shareholder meeting, it was clear that something much more meaningful was unfolding. Buffett, sitting on a stage in an empty Omaha arena, began with a history lesson like no other — a vivid walk through the other moments in America’s past that tested its resiliency, but never broke it. At 89 years old, he’s lived through many of them.
The current crisis “is creating a huge amount of anxiety and changing people's psyche and causing them to somewhat lose their bearings, understandably,” the chairman and CEO of Berkshire told his virtual listeners, while peering out where some 40,000 of them would normally be sitting. “The American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again.”
While his unwavering confidence in the U.S. economy is hardly a new theme in Buffett’s lectures, they’re not normally so moving. Like many of those watching, he was in need of a haircut and acknowledged it, adding that he had grown used to wearing sweat suits — as opposed to the real suit and tie he donned on Saturday. It was a humanizing moment. Watching Buffett was like watching Dr. Anthony Fauci or New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, the two government leaders whose comforting words and realism have probably stuck with Americans most during the pandemic and helped to create a sense of hope and community. 
Even so, going into the event, it wasn’t quite so clear that Buffett still believed in his mantra, “America’s best days lie ahead.” He had been notably quiet in recent weeks, and Berkshire was selling stock and shunning acquisitions, a bearish signal for a company where the ethos is to buy when others are panicking. After all, Buffett once wrote:
Berkshire has done neither, even with $137 billion of cash just sitting there. As such, some say his optimistic outlook doesn’t align with his actions of late. But Buffett explained that the panic hasn’t hit the stock and credit markets to the extent it did during the 2008 financial crisis — or not for as long, thanks to the extraordinary measures taken by the Federal Reserve. His investing during that time “was not designed to make a statement, it was designed to take advantage of what we thought were very attractive terms,” he said. He’s not finding as many enticing investments now, partly because of those Fed actions, which removed the need for many companies to seek a lifeline from a deep-pocketed savior like Buffett.
The complicated public-health aspect of this downturn also makes it impossible to predict how long it will carry on or how much worse it will get before it gets better. “The cash position isn’t that huge when I look at worst-case possibilities,” Buffett said Saturday.
There are also some industries that may be permanently altered by the coronavirus, such as airlines, Buffett said. Berkshire was a top-three shareholder in American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc., Southwest Airlines Co. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. as recently as early April. Buffett has since decided to completely exit those positions: “The world changed for airlines and we wish them well.”
Even though Buffett is still a believer in the long-term prospects of the U.S. economy as a whole, his 180-degree turn on the airline industry shows that he sees the virus changing at least some consumer behavior for good. That will affect future dealmaking. One of Buffett’s biggest takeovers was Precision Castparts, a supplier of airplane engine parts, which he bought for $37 billion in 2016. It was also his last major transaction. 
As fascinating as Buffett’s commentary was, the Q&A wasn’t the same without his usual sidekick, Charlie Munger, who is known for his quips and comically curt responses compared to Buffett’s monologues. Munger, Berkshire’s longtime vice chairman, is 96 years old and lives in California. Though he is in good health, Buffett said, it didn’t make sense to have him travel to Omaha — a reminder of both their ages, even if they are as sharp as ever. 
Instead of Munger, Buffett was joined by Greg Abel, who oversees all non-insurance operations under the Berkshire umbrella and is Buffett’s likely successor. "When I talk to Greg, sometimes I wonder, am I talking to Warren?” Lawrence Cunningham, a professor at George Washington University Law School and author of books on Berkshire, said during the meeting pre-show. It may be a while before others see him that way. While Abel answered some questions Saturday, he mostly deferred to Buffett and stuck to high-level corporate-speak. 
Buffett, who recently joked that his age puts him “in the urgent zone,” did have a message for whoever does replace him: “I will bet on America the rest of my life, and I hope my successors at Berkshire do.”
He closed the evening with a smile and a laugh: “We’ll see you next year and we’ll fill this place!” Let’s hope. But if it turns out that this virtual event was the Oracle’s last time as the master of ceremonies, it will stand as a fascinating and beautiful sermon that will be remembered.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett says the coronavirus cannot stop America, or Berkshire Hathaway</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday said the United States’ capacity to withstand crises provides a silver lining as it combats the coronavirus, even as he acknowledged that the global pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments.
Over more than 4-1/2 hours at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Buffett said his conglomerate has taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units, and throwing in the total on a multi-billion-dollar bet on U.S. airlines.
Buffett also said he remains keen on making a big acquisition, which he has not done since 2016, but has not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.
The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska with 1-3/4 hours of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year’s bear market, even if the pandemic gets a second wind late this year.
Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, Buffett called dealing with the pandemic “quite an experiment” that had an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible economic outcomes.
But he said Americans have persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression. American “magic” prevailed before and would do again, he said.
“Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it,” Buffett said. “I will bet on America the rest of my life.”
The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo Finance.
Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly 2-1/2 hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.
Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.
BERKSHIRE EXITS AIRLINES
The meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75 billion first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealized losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America Corp and Apple Inc during the market meltdown.
While quarterly operating profit rose 6%, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, hurt by the negative impact of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Buffett said operating earnings will, through at least this year, be “considerably less” than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.
Berkshire’s cash stake ended the quarter at a record $137.3 billion, though Buffett said “we’re willing to do something very big,” perhaps a $30 billion to $50 billion transaction.
But it won’t be in U.S. airlines, after Buffett confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its “entire positions” in the four largest: American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Airlines Holdings Inc.
Buffett said he “made a mistake” investing in the sector, which the pandemic has changed “in a very major way” with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors.
“It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” he said.
The meeting was devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.”
ABEL SHARES THE STAGE
Abel stood in for longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Buffett to answer shareholder questions.
Buffett said Munger was in “fine shape” and “good health,” and looked forward to attending Berkshire’s 2021 annual meeting.
Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire’s insurance businesses and is also considered a possible CEO candidate, was also absent from the meeting. Abel lives closer to Omaha than Munger and Jain.
Berkshire has said its board of directors knows who would become CEO if Buffett died or became incapacitated.
Buffett’s eldest son Howard would likely become non-executive chairman, and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler could succeed Buffett as chief investment officer.
Abel told investors “I don’t see the culture of Berkshire changing” after Buffett and Munger are no longer there.
He also said Berkshire was likely to expand its workforce, which totaled 391,539 people at year end, even though some businesses have furloughed employees and cut salaries since the pandemic began, and could start resorting to layoffs.
Berkshire wouldn’t be alone. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totaled about 30.3 million, or 18% of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.
Abel nonetheless said that in five years, “we see our employment numbers being far greater than they are today.”
Shareholders also elected Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of longtime Berkshire holding American Express Co , to Berkshire’s board, making him the company’s first African American director.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus cannot stop America or Berkshire Hathaway, says Warren Buffett</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday said the United States' capacity to withstand crises provides a silver lining as it combats the coronavirus, even as he acknowledged that the global pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments.
Over more than four and half hours at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Buffett said his conglomerate has taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units, and throwing in the total on a multi-billion-dollar bet on US airlines, the Reuters reported.
Buffett also said he remains keen on making a big acquisition, which he has not done since 2016, but has not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.
The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska with 1 hour 45 minutes of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year's bear market, even if the pandemic gets a second wind late this year.
Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, Buffett called dealing with the pandemic "quite an experiment" that had an "extraordinarily wide" range of possible economic outcomes.

But he said Americans have persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression. American "magic" prevailed before and would do again, he said.
"Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it," Buffett said. "I will bet on America the rest of my life."
The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo Finance.
Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly 2 and half hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.
Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire's non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.

The meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75 billion first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealized losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America Corp and Apple Inc during the market meltdown.

U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer had sent a letter to the Small Business Administration (SBA) demanding a review of all loans made to Ashford, run by Trump donor and Dallas hotelier Monty Bennett.
According to media reports, the hospitality firm is the biggest known applicant of the government’s small-business relief program.
The company said it would return the funds due to the SBA’s “recently changed rules” and “inconsistent federal guidance that put the companies at compliance risk.”
The group’s publicly traded companies overseen by Bennett include Ashford Inc, Ashford Hospitality Trust Inc and Braemar Hotels & Resorts Inc.
Schumer said in his letter that he was “deeply concerned that large, publicly traded companies, like Ashford, may be exploiting the Program.”
The company said in its statement, “Some media and members of Congress have falsely implied” that Ashford accessed loopholes to qualify for the funds.” (Reporting by Aishwarya Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Alistair Bell)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Activist investor hedge fund reportedly financing Eko lawsuit against Quibi over Turnstyle feature</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. is financing Eko’s patent lawsuit against streaming service Quibi, The Wall Street Journal reports. Eko’s suit claims that Quibi stole trade secrets and that its “Turnstyle” feature violates Eko’s patents. Turnstyle allows Quibi videos to play differently depending on the orientation —vertical or horizontal— of the viewer’s phone, switching in real time.
Eko wants Quibi to stop using its technology or license it and is suing for a preliminary injunction and damages. As part of the financing arrangement, Elliott would get an equity stake in Eko, according to the WSJ, though it’s not clear how much money is involved.
Quibi, the mobile video app that launched last month, raised nearly $2 billion to produce “quick bite” shows that last a max of 10 minutes. It filed a lawsuit against Eko a day before Eko filed its suit, asking a court to find that Turnstyle doesn’t infringe Eko’s patent. Quibi told The Verge in March that Turnstyle was its patented technology and that Eko’s claims were “without merit.”
A Quibi spokesperson reiterated its stance in a statement emailed to The Verge late Sunday. “As we made clear in our filing, Quibi’s patented Turnstyle feature is the result of the work from our talented engineering team,” the spokesperson said. “When a new product launches, these types of claims are unfortunately too common. Eko’s actions and complaints remain meritless.”
Elliott Management did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday. An Eko spokesperson declined to comment.
Elliott Management is known for aggressive investor activism, backed by more than $40 billion in capital. The group was behind a recent push to replace Jack Dorsey as CEO of Twitter. The two sides reached an agreement in March that allowed Dorsey to remain as CEO but gave Elliott executive Jesse Cohn a seat on Twitter’s board, and a seat on a board committee tasked with evaluating a CEO succession plan for Twitter. Elliott also acquired a stake in AT&T in 2019, writing in a letter that the telco “suffered from operational and execution issues over the past decade, for which the current leadership team is accountable.” But it supported the recent appointment of AT&T COO John Stankey to CEO, according to CNBC.
(Disclosure: Vox Media, which owns The Verge, has a deal with Quibi to produce a Polygon Daily Essential, and there have been talks about a Verge show.)
UPDATE: May 3rd 6:40PM ET: Added information about Elliott’s role at AT&T
UPDATE May 3rd 7:06 PM ET: Added that Eko declined to comment.
UPDATE May 4th 9:50AM ET: Added comment from Quibi spokesperson

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hedge Fund Elliott Management Backs Patent Lawsuit Against Quibi</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The activist investor that waged high-profile battles with AT&T and Twitter is financing a patent infringement lawsuit against mobile streaming service Quibi, a source familiar with the matter confirms.
Elliott Management agreed to fund Eko’s suit in exchange for an equity stake in the company, theWall Street Journal first reported.
The dispute centers on Quibi’s signature feature, called Turnstyle, which displays full-screen video horizontally or vertically—depending on how the viewer holds the phone.
The Israeli company claims two Quibi employees, who were provided access to its subsidiary’s technology while working at Snap, stole its idea. A Quibi spokesperson issued a statement denying that, saying Eko’s claims lack merit.
The conflict will pit Elliott’s combative founder, billionaire Paul E. Singer, against another tenacious figure, Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg.
Elliott had previously called for the ouster of Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, before reaching a settlement with the company earlier this year. AT&T agreed last year to separate the CEO and chairman roles after Randall Stephenson stepped down.
Quibi launched on April 6, 2020, debuting a service designed to deliver quick bursts of entertainment for busy people on the go—in the middle of a pandemic. Katzenberg and CEO Meg Whitman raised $1.75 billion to launch the service, which attracted 1.7 million downloads in its first week.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ireland unveils 6.5 billion euro coronavirus business package</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUBLIN: Ireland will allow firms impacted by the coronavirus crisis to warehouse tax liabilities for 12 months, offering a "lifeline" as part of an additional package of business supports that could reach 6.5 billion euros (US$7.2 billion), the government announced on Saturday (May 2).
Commercial rates will also be written off for three months, a 2 billion euro credit guarantee scheme introduced for small and medium sized businesses and Ireland's sovereign wealth fund mandated to invest 2 billion euros directly into bigger firms, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said in a statement.
After a lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19, Ireland laid out a roadmap on Friday for a gradual re-opening of the economy that could allow building sites and some retailers to reopen in two weeks, with restaurants following in June, hotels in July and finally pubs in August.
The government concentrated its initial 8 billion euro fiscal response on increased jobless payments and wage subsidies for workers, with 1 billion euros of liquidity supports offered to reeling firms.
The much larger package on Saturday also included a 10,000 euro restart grant for micro and small businesses. Ireland's main business lobby, IBEC, welcomed the measures as an important further step in addressing the cashflow crisis facing many.
Highlighting the scale of the economic shock, Donohoe said firms had deferred 800 million euros of tax in March alone and that that figure could reach 2 billion euros by June.
He also hoped the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund's (ISIF) new equity fund would lead to investment far in excess of the 2 billion euros available capital as it will seek to maximise added capital from existing shareholders and new co-investors.
While Jobs Minister Heather Humphries said more supports will be needed for sectors that will find the coming months harder than others, Donohoe said the acting government had not yet considered any potential sector-specific cut to VAT rates.
Hotels, restaurants and pubs, which will only be allowed operate at limited capacity when they open, have called for the VAT rate for the hospitality sector to be temporarily cut to 0 per cent from 13.5 per cent and for state funds to help them pay rent.
Donohoe said a new government would be required to enact the tax deferral and credit guarantee schemes, the first tangible sign that the political deadlock since an election in February election could directly hurt business if it cannot be broken.
Donohoe's Fine Gael and rival Fianna Fail are trying to find enough support from smaller parties to form a coalition. No new legislation can be passed until a new government is formed and selects the remaining members of the upper house of parliament.
"It is very clear to me that there are economic decisions that our country will need relavent to keeping jobs and creating new jobs that in the coming weeks will require the election of a new Taoiseach (prime minister)," he told a news conference.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Experts optimistic on oil price rise - Premium Times Nigeria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Despite the current crisis in the petroleum sector occasioned by a slide in crude oil prices, industry experts and policy analysts foresee that there will be stabilisation of crude oil price.
They however warn stridently that Nigeria must seize the opportunity of the crisis to undertake long-awaited reforms of the sector and a diversification of the economy.
These points, among others, were the resolutions from the maiden webinar series on Post COVID-19 Petroleum Agenda for Nigeria (PoCoPAN) hosted by OrderPaper Nigeria on April 27.
The event tagged ‘COVID-19 Opportunity for Petroleum Reforms in Nigeria’ was conveyed to aggregate thoughts on the petroleum sector crisis and how Nigeria can benefit from the misfortune of COVID-19.
It featured two highly rated guest speakers – Joe Nwakwue (petroleum industry expert and former government energy advisor) and Tope Fasua (economist and public policy analyst) – and was organised in collaboration with Publish What You Pay Nigeria and DotCivics.
In an outcome document signed by Oke Epia, Executive Director, OrderPaper Nigeria, and Convener, PoCoPAN, the experts noted that the crude oil price stabilisation will occur once the global economy picks up.
Participants of the event were from the petroleum industry, the legislature, the academia, civil society organisations, and the media, among others.
Resolutions from the event read: “Crude oil price would eventually stabilize as global economy gradually picks up (this is due to the fact that price volatility is an inherent characteristic of the Oil and Gas industry).
“There is however, a pervasive concern that the nation may not learn from this present experience based on patterns deduced from previous oil price crash scenarios.
“The present pandemic-induced economic crisis occasioned by the fall in crude oil price is as a result of obsolete and inappropriate policies that regulate the petroleum industry; lack of will by government to use resources from Oil and Gas to facilitate development of industry value chain & other sectors of the economy; over-dependence on foreign technology; and exportation of raw materials rather than refined products.
“Funding of the 2020 national budget in the current crisis is a huge challenge attributed to the fact that Nigeria runs a petro-dollar economy (53% revenue of 2019 budget was provided by foreign exchange from Oil and Gas industry).
“The country’s Oil and Gas industry has not witnessed new exploration in the last decade as critical stakeholders such as investors, host communities and the government remain unsatisfied with the current path the industry threads.
“Diversification and re-invention of the economy from a sole petro-dollar source is highly imperative to insulate the country from the effects of future price volatilities.”
The document further reads: “Critical decisions have to be made to determine models that are most suited for efficient running of the nation’s Oil Gas industry: Joint Ventures (JVs) and Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) need to be re-evaluated so as to determine if the current arrangements are providing maximum benefits for the country. (A potential capacity of Oil and Gas business to generate between 12 and 15 trillion naira per annum was highlighted).
“Revenue from Oil and Gas operations is needed to facilitate the country’s emergence from the Dutch disease hence, it was recommended that Reserve to Production (R/P) ratio should be increased, gas assets developed and the midstream sector enhanced in a string of industry diversification that will impact the economy in general.
“The petrol subsidy regime strongly impedes development of the industry and cobbles the participation of private investors and should therefore be abrogated to allow for deregulation of the downstream sector.
“The economic crisis presented by COVID-19 era is an opportunity to rethink and re-evaluate the modus operandi of the Oil and Gas sector and the nation’s economy at large. Opportunities presented in the development of local technology (artisanal refining for instance), deep focus on gas exploration, development of indigenous human capital in critical sectors of the economy, and enactment of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) should not be lost.”
The thought leaders urged that the COVID-19 pandemic should present “a strong need for increased citizen engagements on transparency and accountability – holding government’s feet to fire – both on the management of the petroleum sector specifically and the nation’s public finance generally.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘End jumbo pay for NASS’ - The Nation Nigeria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Professor Jonathan Aremu is a Professor of International Economic Relations at the Covenant University (CU), Ota, Nigeria and a consultant at the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on Common Investment Market, Abuja, among other multilateral agencies. In this interview with Ibrahim Apekhade Yusuf he speaks on the implications of the falling oil prices on Nigeria and offers suggestions on the way forward. Excerpts:
What is the implication of the falling oil prices on the economy?
With the drastic tumbling price and unpredictable demand contraction facing the oil sector, coupled with COVID-19, there is urgent need to look into Nigerian economy and make urgent necessary adjustments that cut across the entire national public and private governance structure. Both the falling prices of crude oil, which is the main income earner for Nigerian economy, and the coronavirus pandemic is already having negative effects on the country’s main macroeconomic variables such as the exchange rate, price level, employment and growth. Thankfully, to achieve a return to the previous tradition of running the budget from January to December for better implementation and performance, the National Assembly worked on the appropriation bill presented it to the President before the end of 2019. But the speedy passage of the 2020 budget by the government appears meaningless with the global threat of coronavirus as well as the drastic collapse in the crude oil prices. The unpredictable time of exit of these twin problems suggest that there may not be any quick-fix solutions in sight; suggesting the need for fundamental structural changes in the economic governance.
While the 2020 budget was benchmarked on an oil price assumption of $57 per barrel and oil production of 2.18m barrel per day; with the outbreak of coronavirus, the price has gone down to ridiculous level today showing that the economy may earn nothing in the next few months from the product. With the global COVID-19 disaster, the time for the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to discuss cutting production to raise price appears to be irrelevant now. Since the money from oil accounts for about 60 per cent of our revenue and 90 per cent of our foreign exchange, the running and sustenance of Nigerian economy is determined by crude oil price. Furthermore, without the knowledge of the emergence of COVID-19 and falling prices of crude oil, budget 2020 is already a deficit one. Clearly, there is no way the federal government can mitigate the effects of these issues on the economy without drastic decisions; and the need to borrow more than what we envisaged in the budget may not even be a good option as well, unless the conditions for such borrowing will guarantee sustainable development of the economy.
Unfortunately, we don’t know how long the coronavirus will stay, but from what the World Health Organisation (WHO) is saying, it is not disappearing now. Currently, the pandemic has resulted to lockdown of productive activities; and government can only try its best to contain it, but before everybody gets back to life, it will take some time. Even then, since the pandemic affects all sectors of the global economy, a lot of resources to fight it are required even in Nigeria. In other words, substantial budgetary provisions that would have been used to develop Nigeria economy are being deployed to contain the virus at a time when the sector that contributes substantially to the national revenue is in distress.
How soon do you think the economy can recover from the shock of the global oil price crash?
Clearly, the pace of Nigerian economic recovery from the ills of coronavirus and declining oil price remains abysmally slow, as declining real incomes and weak investment continue to weigh on economic activity, while external vulnerabilities remain on the increase, reflecting a higher account deficit and declining reserves that remain highly vulnerable to capital flow reversal; all of these would have negative implications on the national growth, price and exchange rate stability as well as employment. In other words, worsening oil prices and a falling exchange rate will create a further fiscal crisis, imports will become more expensive and inflation pressures will rise, productive sector wobble, unemployment and poverty will worsen and our external reserves further depleted.
What would you suggest as a way forward?
There is urgent need to re-organise our priorities, at both the executive and parliamentary arms of governance. The wastages in the executive arm in terms of overlapping of jurisdictions of activities in governance must be urgently restructured and remunerations for unnecessary activities removed forthwith such as reduction in the numbers of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). On the parliamentary side, the costs of maintaining this arm of governance is out of tune with the current realities. The question is: Does it means that even if we earn nothing from the oil, the National Assembly as still qualified for their jumbo remunerations; while the productive sectors of our national economy is on recess? We must be bold enough re-prioritise in the context of increasing dwindling of national resources. Coupled with the restructuring at the governance levels are other actions to such as: selective fiscal and monetary stimulus in areas that will have an immediate positive impact on our national productivities in all sectors. In addition, there is an urgent need to abandon the current protectionist trade and so as to improve the business climate. The current national debt profile is definitely not sustainable to growth; thus, outright cancellation as well as rescheduling should be embarked upon with the assistance of support from the global economic governance institutions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire sells entire stakes in U.S airlines - Buffett</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway Inc has sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines, Chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company’s annual meeting.
The conglomerate held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines and about 9% stakes in both United Airlines and Southwest Airlines Co at the end of 2019, according to its annual report.
Airline stocks have been hard hit by the near collapse U.S. travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Buffett said Berkshire had invested around $7 billion or $8 billion amassing stakes in the four airlines including American Airlines Group Inc.
“We did not take out anything like $7 or $8 billion and that was my mistake,” Buffett said at the company’s annual meeting which was livestreamed. “I am the one who made the decision.”
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the sales.
“It is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up…. It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” Buffett added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire sells entire stakes in US airlines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK, May 3 — Berkshire Hathaway Inc has sold its entire stakes in the four largest US airlines, Chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company’s annual meeting.
The conglomerate held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11 per cent stake in Delta Air Lines and about 9 per cent stakes in both United Airlines and Southwest Airlines Co at the end of 2019, according to its annual report.
Airline stocks have been hard hit by the near collapse US travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Buffett said Berkshire had invested around US$7 billion or US$8 billion (RM30 or RM34.3 billion) amassing stakes in the four airlines including American Airlines Group Inc.
“We did not take out anything like US$7 or US$8 billion and that was my mistake,” Buffett said at the company’s annual meeting which was livestreamed. “I am the one who made the decision.”
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the sales.
“It is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up.... It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” Buffett added. — Reuters

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THE outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which has so far killed over 230 000 people and crippled economies around the world, is a huge opportunity for Zimbabwe to reindustrialise, economic analysts have said.Declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation in March this year, Covid-19, a respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, has decimated Zimbabwe's fragile economy, with some of the country's major trading partners like China, cancelling orders due to port closures, hurting exports in the process.Economic analysts, who spoke to Standardbusiness, said Zimbabwe should start taking import substitution policies seriously and reindustrialise, lest the whole economy crumbles.The southern African country has been, for a long time, talking about an import substitution policy, but with little support from government in terms of political will and financial support."We need to rethink our strategy as a country. We need to reindustrialise and policy makers should take this more seriously."I see this coronavirus as a significant force for the country to reindustrialise."It can be seen as levelling the ground," Persistence Gwanyanya, an economist, said."It's an opportunity to catch up with the rest of the world."We now need to take advantage of that opportunity to grow our economy."Covid-19, according to ZimTrade — the country's export promotion body — is expected to impact China's global trade for several months as it recorded the first case of the virus.China is one of Zimbabwe's top trading partners, with Harare sending exports worth US$974 million in 2019 against imports of US$368 million, according to Trade Map.Chinese companies are cancelling import orders due to port closures and Zimbabwe's exports to the Asian country would be affected, ZimTrade said."With China having shut down its manufacturing centres and closed its ports, there will be a resultant decrease in demand for the Zimbabwean products," ZimTrade added."At the same time, closed borders in China means Zimbabwean manufacturers that rely on raw materials and other consumables from China will be affected and the spiral effect of reduced manufacturing in China will have a toll on Zimbabwean industries."The major products that Zimbabwe imports from China include machinery, mechanical appliances, boilers, electrical machinery, equipment, vehicles, chemical products, rubber, and plastics.Zimbabwe mainly imports raw materials and machinery for production purposes, which will then be used to manufacture different products some of which are exported."Going forward, it is important for local companies to start considering locally produced raw materials that can support businesses," ZimTrade said."This can be easily achieved if stronger linkages are created between suppliers and buyers so that they can strike a balance between supplying the quality products and right prices."This import substitution will allow the country to create employment and at the same time preserve the scarce foreign currency."Another economic analyst, Believer Mhlanga said it was high time the government analysed Zimbabwe's imports and strategise on substitution."I understand we have been importing things that we can manufacture ourselves or raw materials that we have or can produce on our own," Mhlanga said."Instead of holding hands and counting loses on imports, we should make use of this opportunity to manufacture our own products using our own resources."We should only import raw materials that are not locally available-this should be a turning point for Zimbabwe."We have seen countries like South Africa, Ghana and other developed countries crafting policies that are internally friendly."On exports, Mhlanga said government should engage its counterparts to open the ports and guarantee safety of exports."If they have warehouses for storage they can produce and store in anticipation for the high demand when economies open-provided storage costs are manageable and bearable," he added."The government can come in by providing low cost capital for sustenance."In some of his writings, Richard Chinomona noted that while the Covid-19 crisis had brought about untold fear and suffering to the human race, the challenges Zimbabwe faced after closing its borders had presented unexpected opportunities for the local industries to resuscitate and grow.Chinomona noted that Zimbabwe's industrial base collapsed partly because of the cheap imports mainly from China and Europe."Now that the boarders are by and large closed to international trade this is the time to resuscitate the local industries, produce locally all previous imports and only buy locally made Zimbabwean products," he wrote.Chinomona said forex shortages affected many industries that imported inputs outside Zimbabwe as the country was importing unnecessary products like old clothes, fruits, stationary while also spending a lot on unnecessary government foreign trips."With restricted international trade and government official foreign trips, Zimbabwe can harness the available forex towards the purchase of high-tech machinery to resuscitate and boost our industrial base," he said."Now that Covid-19 disrupted China's production and supplies globally, particularly the dumping of cheap products into the Zimbabwean market, this is the right opportunity to resuscitate our industries and supply the void made in our local market."With Covid-19 also causing havoc in South Africa and most of its industries closed or producing below capacity amid border closures or restrictions, Chinomona said the local market needed Zimbabwe's local industries to supply all the previously imported products.He said Covid-19 was likely to be an issue for at least a year unless a vaccine or cure is found and this on its own, implied that Zimbabwe should gear up to resuscitate its industrial base tosatisfy the local market. Strategies to resuscitate Zimbabwe's industrial base during the crisis, according to Chinomona, should include adoption of a deliberate import substitution strategy as a matter of government policy, creation of a special fund for industrialisation, which makes available cheap funds to the industrial sector.Zimbabwe should craft a policy that discourages importation of products from China, South Africa and Europe, he said."The policy should promote partnership between foreign and Zimbabwean industries and with production done in Zimbabwe," Chinomona said."For instance, if China is our "all weather friend" why can't it come and set up it's industries in Zimbabwe in partnership with our local industries and produce at the lowest possible cost?""Why should China want to produce cheaply thousands of kilometres away from Zimbabwe and then dump its cheap products in Zimbabwe?"If China is really our "all weather friend" then it should bring its technology and build industries in Zimbabwe, produce in Zimbabwe and employ Zimbabweans.Produced in Zimbabwe and Buy Zimbabwe should be Zimbabwe government's priority strategy during this Covid-19 crisis and beyond, Chinomona added.

“Instead of holding hands and counting loses on imports, we should make use of this opportunity to manufacture our own products using our own resources.
“We should only import raw materials that are not locally available-this should be a turning point for Zimbabwe.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">GST Network Helpdesk on Sunday said it has handled over 56,000 taxpayer issues in one month since the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25. According to data from GSTN, over 19,552 tickets raised by taxpayers were resolved between March 25 and April 24. The highest number of tickets handled in a day was 2,766 and the highest number of calls handled was 1,776.
"However, due to the lockdown, there is a steep dip experienced in the call and ticket volume trend at GST helpdesk. The total received transactions (inflow of calls and GRP tickets) are approximately 20 per cent of the usual volume trend," GSTN said.
Before the lockdown, on an average, GST helpdesk would receive around 8,000 to 10,000 calls every day, while around 2,000 tickets were raised on the GRP portal on a daily basis.
The GST Helpdesk, whose 65 per cent of staff worked from home, was fully operational through its toll-free number from 9 am to 9 pm serving in 12 languages, it added.
GSTN CEO Prakash Kumar said help desk agents had to work from home, calls had to be routed to them at their phone and this was done in a secured manner.
"This was not a small job, but necessity made GSTN and its tech partner Tech Mahindra to do this. Today, a good number of associates are providing helpdesk support to GST stakeholders. We would continue to work ensuring 360-degree safety of people and process to combat the situation," Kumar added.
Out of the 12 languages, the Hindi Helpdesk services received the highest number of calls comprising 61.66 per cent of the total call volume, followed by English language with 14.80 per cent volume. Marathi at 4.75 per cent received the third-highest number of calls, closely followed by Gujarati 3.65 per cent, Telugu 3 per cent, Bengali 2.93 per cent and Tamil 2.86 per cent. The other languages are Kannada, Punjabi, Oriya, Malayalam and Assamese which registered lesser call volume respectively.

    <h5 class="mb-1">International Economic Week In Review 4/27-5/1</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
Investment thesis: Most of the markets are still far too speculative to make any kind of investment. We're starting to get the economic reports about the severity of the damage and its severe. However, the China and Brazil trades from last week are still attractive for now.
The latest Markit PMI for Chinashows a modest contraction in manufacturing (emphasis added):
Here's a chart of the data:
Notice how quickly the data bounced back to near the 50 level that separates expansion and contraction. New orders were at their lowest level in three months while employment dropped and backlogs increased. The primary problem is the drop in new export orders, which is shown in this chart:
China was the first country hit by the pandemic; it shut down its economy about a month to a month and a half before other regions. The drop in export orders is caused by that four-to-eight-week delay. I would expect it to bounce back within the next few months.
The Bank of Japan released its latest summary of economic projections and economic outlook, which contained the following observation about the long-term risks to the economy (emphasis added):
While the first concern has been implied in the financial press, it hasn't been explained this well. The current thinking about the pandemic appears to be that it is largely a March-June period of aberrant economic activity that will naturally resolve itself by mid-3Q20. Assuming that to be the case, the consensus forecast is for a 2H20 economic rebound. But the longer this goes on, the more pronounced the negative impact of sentiment, which will have a negative impact on consumer and business spending.
This is the first time I've seen the second observation and it's a very interesting point to make. The BOJ is arguing that should the outbreak continue for an extended time, the global economy would be forced to completely rethink itself using "information and communications technology" as central components of that transformation. It doesn't say what this will look like, only that technology would enable it to happen.
In other news, Japanese retail sales were down 4.6% Y/Y in March while industrial production declined 5.2%.
South Korea continues to be the best performing COVID economy: industrial production only decreased .3% M/M in March while retail sales increased 1%.
Russia released two coincidental economic data points. 1Q GDP rose 2.1% Y/Y in 1Q20 while retail sales increased 5.6% Y/Y in March. Neither data set includes lockdown information, so the only thing they really show is that the Russian economy was in fair shape before the lockdown.
EU GDP contracted 3.5% Y/Y in the first quarter:
There is also new information from the largest EU economies:
Today, not only did the ECB add a number of new programs to support liquidity, they also issued a new "whatever it takes" statement (emphasis added):
Don't be surprised to see additional facilities in the future.
Statistics Canada released a flash estimate for March GDP:
Let's look at this week's performance table:
Last week was a stellar week for Latin America: the ETF that tracks the region was the best performer, gaining 7.31%. Brazil rebounded from its sell-off, taking on a gain of 6.41%. A majority of the indexes were up or down modestly. China was the worst-performing sector; it was down 2.28%.
Last week, I noted that traders with a high risk appetite might want to consider going long China or short Brazil. Both markets did the exact opposite.China was breaking out very nicely - until there was new talk of trade sanctions and heightened tensions between it and the US. There was also an uptick in hostilities between the mainland and Australia, as that country argued there should be an international investigation of the virus outbreak.Brazil rallied during the first part of the week but sold off on Thursday and Friday.
I'd hold on to both for at least another week with a sell-stop on the China position just in case there's a sudden uptick in the war of words.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Risk To Escalate When U.S. Monthly Employment Data Released Next Week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the release of the US and EU GDP figures, Q1 is behind us. Amidst the great uncertainty, there is at least one thing that is clear. The current quarter is going to be worse, even if not for China. The good news is that with lockdowns gradually easing, the US and European Union, and parts of Asia are probably near the peak of the economic contraction.
The March data suggested China was likely past its low point, and the April PMI, if one accepts it as face value, shows the domestic economy is gaining traction. The non-manufacturing PMI rose to 53.2 in April, which is above the six-month, 12-month, and 24-month averages (49.5, 51.6, and 53.0, respectively). Fears that China will take advantage of the situation to buy depressed assets are prompting many countries to look to tighten up rules about foreign direct investment, especially by state-owned companies. There also appears to be greater sensitivity to sectors, such as medicine and medical equipment, in which officials want to discourage foreign investment.
In the week ahead, the April PMIs may pose some headline risk, but the preliminary reports steal most of the thunder. The May reports will be more interesting as the economies may begin showing signs of stabilizing, before turning up in June or July. The week will start slowly as China and Japan are on holiday through Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.
The most interesting, if not important, data point next week the US national employment data at the end of the week. In the four-week period up to the week the establishment survey was conducted, weekly initial jobless claims rose by an astounding 22 mln. Given high levels of uncertainty and unknowns, this gives a rough sense of the magnitude of the impact and, by chance, is also the median forecast for the loss of jobs last month. This in on top of the 701k jobs lost in March.
From the household survey, the unemployment rate is derived. The rise in weekly jobless claims suggests something on the magnitude of 16.0%-16.5%. Here too, the impact has been so profound that the normal confidence intervals around forecasts are not helpful. Under usual circumstances, the difference of a couple tenths of a percent in the unemployment rate (or 100k in the nonfarm payrolls) is significant. Still, now the more considerable variability has been granted. It is also understood that the data lags the developments on the ground, and that thing will get worse in the months ahead.
The US economy contracted by 4.8% (annualized pace) in the first quarter. It held up better than China (-9.8% quarter-over-quarter) and the eurozone (-3.8% quarter-over-quarter). The second quarter will likely tell a different story. China may return to growth. Local government infrastructure spending will provide the necessary fillip. The downturn in Europe and the US will accelerate sharply. A 10%-15% contraction in Q2 in the eurozone looks reasonable. In the US, the annualized decline in output of between 20% and 30% would not be surprising.
The idea that the US economy will be "rocking" by July, as some officials have suggested, seems like one of those aspirational truths rather than a thoughtful economic projection. First, without a cure or vaccine, it appears that new flare-ups of the virus are nearly inevitable as social distancing is relaxed. Second, in aggregate terms, almost an eighth of the US workforce depends on mass transportation. Of course, it is not evenly distributed, with several large urban centers accounting for the bulk, and only about half of workers have access to public transportation. Until people feel safe, the re-opening can only go so far.
Canada also reports April jobs data at the end of the week. Remember the proportions: As a rough and ready estimate, Canada's GDP is a little less than 1/10 of the US, and its population is a little more than 1/10 of America's. It lost more than a million jobs in March (divided almost 50/50 between full and part-time positions. As of May 1, there were three contributors to the Bloomberg survey for Canada's April jobs data. Two of them were looking for jobs losses of 5 mln or more. The third was the outlier at a still staggering 1.2 mln. The unemployment rate could rise toward 20%. 
Canada entered the crisis with fiscal capacity. Consider that the federal government's deficit was a little more than 0.5% of GDP in 2019. The ratio is a function of how large the contraction in the denominator (GDP) and how much the numerator (deficit) will rise. Canada's fiscal response is estimated to be almost C$100 bln or a little more than 4% of (2019) GDP. The IMF's new World Economic Outlook projects the Canadian economy to contract by 6.2% this year. Canada could wind up with a budget deficit of something around 5%. In contrast, the US budget deficit in 2019 was about 4.7% of GDP. The Congressional Budget Office projects this year's shortfall to be near $3.7 trillion or 18% of GDP.
A common refrain is that US yields are low because the Federal Reserve is buying Treasuries. It is obscuring the price discovery process. Perhaps, but not in the way that one might suspect. If the Fed stood back completely and pulled back from the alphabet soup of facilities, the capital markets would seize up like a cardiac arrest. The demand for Treasuries would surge. Interest rates would plummet. This is not a projection or forecast. It is what happened for a few days in March when the markets were unhinged, and the 10-year Treasury yield fell to almost 30 bp. The stabilization of the capital markets saw the 10-year yield rise. Last month, it traded between about 54 bp and 78 bp. 
As the markets stabilized, foreign central banks also stopped selling Treasuries. For six consecutive weeks beginning in early March, foreign central banks sold nearly $110 bln of US bonds from their custody accounts the Federal Reserve holds for them. In percentage terms of their holdings, it is rather minor. When their holdings bottomed in early April, they were worth about $2.85 trillion. 
Still, it helped spark the Fed to offer repo facilities so foreign central banks would not have to sell their Treasuries. We were skeptical of its merits as 1) banks were already providing this kind of facility, and 2) that foreign central banks were not the disruptive element. Subsequent research at the Bank for International Settlements suggests it was large pools of leveraged capital playing for small incremental movements played a significant role, for example. 
The repo facility does not appear to have been utilized. However, as the capital markets stabilized, foreign central banks have begun buying back their Treasuries. In the last three reporting weeks, foreign central banks have bought about $24 bln of US Treasuries for their accounts at the Fed. 
One thing that could scare foreign investors and especially central banks is anyone who gave the recent press report that the possibility of that the US would default on debt owned by China a shred of credibility. Even if the US wanted to get China to "pay for Covid-19" by not servicing its debt, it is more complicated then merely not sending Beijing a check on the interest of the nearly $1.1 trillion of US Treasuries it held at the end of February (according to US estimates).
It was quickly denied by Trump's chief economic spokesperson Kudlow. One cannot help but wonder why it was leaked in the first place. It is clear that such a topic is sacrosanct. Even broaching it is dangerous. The amount of money saved by not servicing debt that is owed to China would be lost many times over as a consequence. 
Was it planted intentionally to allow for the denial, and making the other retaliatory measures more palatable?  Other actions, like removal of its sovereign immunity, which would make China subject to lawsuits in the US, is a dangerous road to embark upon as the US also benefits from it. The US could deny government pension funds from investing in Chinese stocks, but it would likely impact the returns more than China. 
While some US officials appear to have already reached a conclusion, many other countries in Europe and Asia have called for a thorough investigation. It is disheartening and troublesome that China is attacking those seeking an inquiry and not cooperating with the World Health Organization that is looking into the origins of the virus. 
China's markets are closed for the extended May Day holiday, which will carry into the first couple of days in the week ahead. The offshore yuan sold off on May 1, and the roughly 0.75% decline was the most since mid-March. The dollar was at its best level in nearly a month, reaching almost CNH7.14. Some suspect it could be China firing a warning shot. It might be, but it does not seem like the most likely explanation. The offshore yuan's decline began during US trading on April 30 and took another leg up in the NorthAmerican session on May 1. There was no need for Chinese officials to do anything because the market was doing it for them if a softer yuan was desired. Asset managers with onshore yuan or offshore yuan exposure (e.g., Dim Sum bonds) might want to hedge the currency risk using the offshore market. Speculators can express their views easier in CNH than CNY. We note that ahead of the weekend, US yields were slightly softer, as the equity losses, disappointing earnings, and weak data sapped risk appetites.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kickstarter Prepares To Shed 'Up To 45-Per Cent' Of Staff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kickstarter has been transparent that, as a result of the pandemic, the number of fundraising projects on the platform is nowhere near normal. Today, the company confirmed to Gizmodo that shrinking revenues have forced it to drastically reduce staff.
The economic impacts of coronavirus have been dramatic and difficult to predict: massive unemployment is an expectation when whole swaths of the economy shut down overnight, while farmers destroying their food and the collapse of the online ad market were far less obvious. With no physical footprint, Kickstarter would appear to be well positioned to weather this crisis, but that hasn’t been the case.
“While people are continuing to support live projects on Kickstarter as normal, the COVID crisis has led to a 35% drop in live projects from a year ago,” David Gallagher, Kickstarter’s senior communications officer, told Gizmodo in an email. (Less than a month ago, the company stated that “the number of live projects on Kickstarter is down about 25% from this time last year,” suggesting the financial situation is continuing to worsen.) “Fees on funded projects are our only source of income. Our margins were already thin before the crisis, and we don’t know when this situation will turn around,” Gallagher stated.
The news of staff reductions was first made public by OPEIU, the union which Kickstarter employees successfully joined in February, becoming the first major tech company to organise. According to the union, members “voted tonight to ratify a lay-off agreement with the crowdfunding company after CEO Aziz Hasan announced sweeping layoffs of up to 45 per cent of employees.”
Gallagher contests the 45-per cent figure, and while the union solely refers to these reductions as layoffs, Gallagher indicated the staff reductions include some amount of voluntary buyouts. “When we know which employees are interested in leaving voluntarily, we will be able to look at those roles and the company’s strategic needs, and better understand the scale of any layoffs that may be required,” he wrote.
Both Kickstarter and the union agree on the terms which were negotiated for departing employees, however, which include four months’ reverence, up to six months’ health insurance, and the ability to return to their current roles within a year if the company is in a position to hire for them.
“It’s devastating that so many of our brilliant, passionate colleagues are being let go. But I’m incredibly proud that we were able to leverage our collective power to assure that the terms of our severance are generous, uplifting and well-tailored to the specific needs of our unique workforce,” Oriana Leckert, a Kickstarter employee and member of the union bargaining committee wrote in a statement.
“We all wish we could have avoided this situation, but the outcome of these negotiations is better because of the open and collaborative process we undertook with the union,” Gallagher wrote. “We will have to say goodbye to colleagues and that is never easy. But we believe this agreement offers security to those we are letting go, and ensures Kickstarter can weather this crisis and serve its mission.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pretty Little thing founder furloughs staff despite lavish lifestyle and £1bn fortune</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The founder of fashion retailer Pretty Little Thing has placed his staff into furlough - despite being worth £1bn.
Tycoon Umar Kamani, 32, has put 86 members of staff at his Manchester-based company into furlough, while he enjoys a lavish lifestyle in Dubai.
Umar is one of many businesses who have decided to use the government's scheme which uses taxpayers money to pay 80 per cent of their wages.
But Mr Kamani doesn't appear to be phased by the lockdown or the decision to furlough his staff when he posted a photo on Instagram of his Dubai home, along with his girlfriend Nada Adelle, 26, on April 18, with the caption 'isolationship'.
Pretty Little Thing reported a turnover of £374m in 2018, six years after Umar launched the company.
His father Mahmud founded internet fashion company Boohoo, which led Umar to launching his own company in 2012.
Umar lives a luxurious lifestyle - he owns two Rolls-Royce cars, a Lamborghini worth £300,000 and other expensive cars.
He is friends with some of the world's most famous celebrities, such as Denzel Washington, Jennifer Lopez and Kylie Jenner, and others.
Umar also made £5m from an investment company that is developing a news coronavirus antigen test, according to reports.
He spent £1m in shares in Avacta Group. which is working with US-based Adeptrix to develop a Covid-19 test.
Mr Kamani paid 18p a share for stock in the company but shares continue to spike as the company continues to work on a test.
Commenting on the decision to place its staff into furlough, a Pretty Little Thing spokesperson told the Mail Online : "We are entering an unprecedented period and while it is too early to quantify the future impact of Covid-19, we are taking measures to position the business to protect jobs going forward and keep the business on a strong financial footing in what we expect to be a temporary environment.
"It is important to note that Pretty Little Thing staff are still being paid their full salary as a result of the Government furlough initiative and the company's decision to 'top up' salaries so they receive 100 per cent of what they would usually be entitled to each month."
The spokesman added that some staff would be returning to work on Monday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pretty Little Thing founder Umar Kamani worth £1billion took taxpayers' cash to furlough 86 staff... as the playboy tycoon lounges in a pool with his beautiful girlfriend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lounging in a pool with his beautiful girlfriend, fashion tycoon Umar Kamani seems not to have a care in the world. But while the Pretty Little Thing founder enjoys a spa in Dubai, ordinary taxpayers are covering the cost of his employees' wages. 
The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the 32- year-old, whose personal wealth is estimated at £1billion, has furloughed 86 members of staff at his Manchester-based company.
He took the decision shortly after the lockdown in order to use the Government's scheme, which uses taxpayers' money to pay workers 80 per cent of their usual income up to a maximum of £2,500 per month. 
Pretty Little Thing had a turnover of £374million in 2018, yet saddling the taxpayer with the cost of paying his workers didn't appear to trouble Mr Kamani when he posted a photograph at his Dubai home with girlfriend Nada Adelle, 26, on Instagram on April 18, with the caption: 'Isolationship.' 
On the same day, one of his employees wrote on Twitter about how missing work had left her feeling 'depressed' and 'bipolar'. Mr Kamani, whose father Mahmud founded the internet fashion firm Boohoo, launched his own company in 2012. 
His wealth has allowed him to buy a fleet of cars, including two Rolls-Royce Phantoms, a £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador, a £92,000 customised G-Class Mercedes and a high-end Range Rover.
He leads a playboy lifestyle, regularly travelling by private jet to socialise with the likes of P Diddy, Jennifer Lopez and Denzel Washington.
Other pictures on his Instagram account show him with US reality star Kylie Jenner, dining at the plush Nobu restaurant in Malibu and posing at the wheel of a yacht on Italy's Amalfi Coast.
As well as deferring the cost of his staff to the taxpayer, Mr Kamani has made £5million from an investment in a company that is developing a new Covid-19 antigen test. 
Last month, he spent £1million on shares in Avacta Group. Mr Kamani paid 18p a share for stock in the company but the price has risen sharply throughout April on hopes the firm will successfully develop the antigen test. 
Shares closed on Friday at 109p each, giving the company a market capitalisation of £226.7million. That means Mr Kamani's investment is now worth almost £5 million. 
Last night, a spokesman for Umar Kamani, who lives in Alderley Edge, the Cheshire village popular with Premier League footballers, said: 'We are entering an unprecedented period and while it is too early to quantify the future impact of Covid-19, we are taking measures to position the business to protect jobs going forward and keep the business on a strong financial footing in what we expect to be a temporary environment. 
'It is important to note that Pretty Little Thing staff are still being paid their full salary as a result of the Government furlough initiative and the company's decision to 'top up' salaries so they receive 100 per cent of what they would usually be entitled to each month.' 
The spokesman also said a number of Pretty Little Thing employees would be returning to work tomorrow. 
James Corden is taking a £45,000-a-week salary cut to cover the wages of 60 furloughed staff who work on his US chat show. 
The 41-year-old presenter of The Late Late Show took the decision after the CBS TV network said it would only cover the salaries of production workers until tomorrow. 
The show was shut down on March 15 due to coronavirus but relaunched with a skeleton crew from the garage of Corden's £8million Los Angeles home on April 14. 
Pledging to continue broadcasting, the comedian said: 'Socially, we can be as connected as ever. Physically, we can't be together, but socially and mentally we can be together. The world has never been more equipped for us to stay connected to each other.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett says coronavirus cannot stop America</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett said on Saturday gave an upbeat assessment of the United States’ ability to withstand crises, even as he acknowledged that the coronavirus pandemic could have a wide range of impacts on the economy.
The 89-year-old Buffett spoke at Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, which was held virtually for the first time, without shareholders, because of the pandemic. The meeting was streamed by Yahoo Finance.
Buffett said the potential impact of the pandemic, which has already battered the global economy, had a “extraordinarily wide” range.
But he maintained his usual optimism that the United States would weather it successfully, citing its emergence from crises such as World War Two and the influenza pandemic a century ago.
“This is quite an experiment,” Buffett said. “I remain convinced … that nothing can basically stop America.”
The annual meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75 billion first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealized losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America Corp and Apple Inc during the market meltdown.
While quarterly operating profit rose 6%, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, and Berkshire said some of its more than 90 businesses are facing “severe” negative effects from COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Buffett also let Berkshire’s cash stake soar to $137.3 billion as of March 31, reflecting difficulty in finding good places to invest.
The meeting is devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.”
Buffett is expected to answer shareholder questions at the meeting.
He is being joined by Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, who has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive officer.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s government on Saturday said the U.S. Commerce Department had published a notification of its intention to keep an agreement regulating Mexican sugar exports into the United States active for another five years.
The United States in 2014 imposed hefty duties on imports of Mexican sugar after determining the country’s sugar firms were dumping cheap, subsidized sugar into the U.S. market.
The two governments then reached a deal to remove duties, which established quotas and minimum prices for imports of raw and refined sugars from Mexico.
“The announcement…is a good sign for Mexican sugar exports, given that it provides certainty and maintains access to the U.S. market under preferential conditions,” Mexico’s economy ministry said in a statement.
In the current sugar cycle, Mexico will be able to export up to 1,421,901 metric tons to the United States, the highest amount since the 2014 agreement, the ministry added. (Reporting by Miguel Angel Gutierrez Editing by Alistair Bell)

The United States in 2014 imposed hefty duties on imports of Mexican sugar after determining the country's sugar firms were dumping cheap, subsidized sugar into the U.S. market.
The two governments then reached a deal to remove duties, which established quotas and minimum prices for imports of raw and refined sugars from Mexico.
    "The announcement...is a good sign for Mexican sugar exports, given that it provides certainty and maintains access to the U.S. market under preferential conditions," Mexico's economy ministry said in a statement.
    In the current sugar cycle, Mexico will be able to export up to 1,421,901 metric tons to the United States, the highest amount since the 2014 agreement, the ministry added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway loses $50B during coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cue the tiny violins: One of the world’s richest men has lost billions because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. investment firm posted a quarterly net loss of $50 billion Saturday and reported that a number of its 90 operating businesses have been “severely affected,” according to Reuters. 
Buffett, 89, is nicknamed the Oracle of Omaha because of his Nebraska roots and investment savvy. He is the fifth-wealthiest billionaire, according to Forbes, with a personal net worth of about $72 billion. The other top four: Jeff Bezos, $138 billion; Bill Gates, $104 billion; Bernard Arnault, $94 billion; and Mark Zuckerberg, $75 billion.
Berkshire saw two of its biggest businesses take particularly hard hits.
BNSF Railway, North America’s largest freight railroad network, saw shipping volumes of consumer products and coal plummet, while insurance giant Geico set aside money for car premiums it probably won’t collect.
The smaller operations cut salaries and furloughed workers, and retailers such as See’s Candies and Nebraska Furniture Mart closed stores.
Berkshire reported buying a net $1.8 billion of stocks in the first quarter but selling a net $6.1 billion in April. The investment firm repurchased $1.7 billion of its own stock in the first quarter, but that was less than the prior quarter.
The pandemic also has forced Buffett to cancel “Woodstock for Capitalists,” a weekend festival that normally draws tens of thousands of people to Omaha.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett’s company reports Q1 loss of $50 billion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
Hard-hit by the market rout surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company of Warren Buffett, has reported first-quarter net losses of nearly $50 billion, it reported Saturday.
The company, based in Omaha, Nebraska, called the setback “temporary” but said it could not reliably predict when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
Buffett is considered one of the savviest investors anywhere. His fortune of $72 billion is the fourth-largest in the world, according to Forbes, and in normal years, the company’s annual gathering in Omaha is a high-point of the calendar for investors, a “Woodstock for capitalists.”
But the devastating economic impact of the pandemic has hit hard at Berkshire Hathaway’s wide range of investments, and the need for social distancing forced it to hold the annual meeting online.
The meeting is set to begin at 3:45 pm Central time (2045 GMT) and will be live-streamed.
Buffett, in a statement, played down the bleak-looking net figure. He said a better measure of the company’s performance was its operating earnings, which exclude investments and are less subject to sharp fluctuations.
By that measure, Berkshire Hathaway saw growth to $5.9 billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier.
The brutal drop in the net — to a loss of $49.75 billion from a profit last year of $21.7 billion — resulted primarily from the virus-related decline in value of its broad investment portfolio, which ranges from energy to transport to insurance and technology.
The annual meeting often has an almost carnival atmosphere, as thousands of fans and investors flock to Nebraska to hear from the celebrated “Oracle of Omaha.” Buffett, famous for his relatively sedate lifestyle, turns 90 on August 30.
In documents filed Saturday, Berkshire noted that until mid-March many of its companies were posting “comparative revenue and earnings increases” over the same 2019 period.
Many of its companies — including in rail transport, energy production, and some manufacturing and service businesses — are deemed essential and are able to continue working amid the far-reaching confinement orders.
But their turnover slowed considerably in April, the company statement said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Venture capitalists reveal the startups that changed everything in the past decade</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 2010s were a wild ride for startups and the investors who pumped money into them.
As the decade kicked off, smartphones were becoming ubiquitous, connecting billions of people to the internet — many for the first time — and paving the way for a wave of innovative business models.
Online marketplaces and sharing economy platforms — Amazon, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, and many more — demonstrated the power of network effects, and in doing so, completely changed how people and businesses interact with each other.
Companies seized on the stream of constant, real-time, location-based, and personalized data that consumers volunteered via a growing list of smart devices to provide them with faster and more convenient services.
Entrepreneurs had the wind at their backs, thanks to a flood of venture money and access to technical infrastructure —  Amazon Web Services — meaning they could spin up and scale up their startups like never before. Unicorns seemed to appear everywhere, and tech IPOs had investors excited.
But the tides began to turn in the second half of the decade as a flood of scandals chipped away at the idea that tech companies — and tech founders — are inherently good. Public investors became skeptical of the premium price attached to some tech companies, and the batch that went public in 2019 had a rough go of things.
Four months into 2020, the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic has rocked the global economy and startup world, leading to at least 30,000 layoffs at venture-backed companies and even impacting unicorn tech darlings like Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, and Peloton as funding and sales have dried up. 
After speaking with five venture capitalists about how things have evolved since 2010, some clear lessons emerged — as well as some clear examples of those lessons. While it would be impossible to include every important startup, below are the companies that investors said have had the most impact on their industry in the past 10 years.
Uber's Travis Kalanick, Theranos' Elizabeth Holmes, and WeWork's Adam Neumann: All were considered charismatic and visionary founders who sought to change the world, but each was eventually forced out of their respective companies amid scandal.
When Holmes resigned in 2018 in the face of criminal charges and reports of fraud at Theranos, "everyone in venture really questioned their own diligence," Kristin Gunther, a principal at Revolution, told Business Insider. Gunther added that it made her reflect on how she engages as a board member.
"Against a background where, for a couple years here, hot deals moved really fast and people could get funded based on two PowerPoint slides, it became even more important to say, 'Hey, fine, this is a hot deal, but I'm going to miss it because it's not worth it to cut the corners,'" Gunther said. 
Kalanick was also forced out for cutting corners. In 2017, investors orchestrated his resignation at a time when Uber's public image had plummeted. Once a company that every investor wanted in on, critics had started alleging that Uber enabled workplace harassment, skirted local regulations, and that Kalanick's own behavior had put the company on a crash course.
Neumann, WeWork's eccentric founder, stepped down earlier this year after the company's failed attempt to go public led to reports of his extensive conflicts of interest, mismanagement, and bizarre behavior.
All three companies epitomized Silicon Valley's obsessive focus on growth and a celebration of ambitious founders, which often ignored problematic behavior and business practices.
"I just think we abandoned values in terms of, not just how we invested, but managed companies," Elliott Robinson, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, told Business Insider.
The pervasiveness of social media and digital ads has given companies powerful new ways to connect with their target audience and helped enable the rise of direct-to-consumer brands.
Anu Duggal, founding partner at Female Founders Fund, told Business Insider that social media has "enabled brands to have a direct conversation with those consumers and have that impact their actual product design."
Duggal highlighted brands like Warby Parker and Glossier as companies that have effectively leveraged conversations with those consumers to inform product development.
Jenny Lefcourt, general partner at Freestyle and founding member of All Raise, said another reason these brands have been so successful is that they've created "authentic community" among their consumers.
"Maybe you go to Glossier because you love makeup and you start connecting with the community about that and before you know it, you start becoming friends and you're sharing travel tips," Lefcourt told Business Insider.
These companies didn't initially seem like sure bets, however. Gunther pointed to online retailer Jet.com and its acquisition by Walmart as an important proof of concept, and said it "showed the exit path for some of these direct-to-consumer companies where that was really a question."
It's no secret that venture capital firms — and, as a result, the entrepreneurs they fund — suffer from a lack of diversity. A recent survey by RateMyInvestor found that the typical founding team was a "two person, 'all male,' 'all white,' U.S. university-educated team residing in Silicon Valley."
Over the past decade, however, with several women-led ventures reaching multi-billion-dollar valuations and Stitch Fix founder Katrina Lake becoming the youngest female founder to take a company public, investors are finally taking notice.
"Venture capitalists are pattern matchers," Lefcourt said. "Seeing these women take these companies from start to IPO and be incredibly successful enables other venture capitalists — whether they're men or women — to change their view on what successful looks like."
Venture capital firms still have a long way to go both in terms of who they invest in and who is doing the investing, especially when it comes to racial and educational diversity. But, at least when it comes to women-led ventures, Duggal said investors are "recognizing the fact that there are real returns to be made."
RateMyInvestor's survey also found that venture funds have a strong geographical bias, with nearly half of all investments in the past five years going to startups based in Silicon Valley. But in recent years, several companies have revealed the untapped potential of other markets, particularly outside of the US.
"There were always great companies and great innovation outside of the US," Victoria Treyger, general partner and managing director at Felicis Ventures, told Business Insider. But prior to Shopify, she said, "there was a belief that VC-backed companies outside of the US exited earlier."
Shopify, which is based in Ottawa, Canada, is notable for its outsize role in empowering small and medium businesses. Robinson, who invested in Shopify, said that by building ecommerce tools and "multiple revenue streams off of a really large user base, that just really changed the way people thought about [software as a service]."
Atlassian, an enterprise software company out of Sydney, similarly put Australia on the map. "I just see the number of [Atlassian] alums that are in that ecosystem," Treyger said, noting how employees of pioneering companies like Shopify and Atlassian often go on to start their own ventures.
Israel has also become a hotbed of entrepreneurial activity. It has produced household names like Waze (which was acquired by Google) and, in 2018, 61 companies exited at an average deal size of $81 million.
Within the US, cities like Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Portland, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C., have also seen massive increases in both investment and startups.
Fintech was another sector this decade that saw major disruption and a flurry of new companies achieving massive valuations. Startups took advantage of the rise of smartphones, digital banking, and machine learning to bring more consumers into the financial system and upend how people spend, make, borrow, and exchange money.
"When you look underneath, there is true technological innovation," Treyger said. "It's really exciting to see that the dollars went into companies that have truly transformed the financial service sector."
As just a few examples, Stripe and Square helped change the way businesses get paid, Lending Club and SoFi took on incumbents in the personal loan space, and Robinhood reinvented how everyday consumers invest.

Fintech was another sector this decade that saw major disruption and a flurry of new companies achieving massive valuations. Startups took advantage of the rise of smartphones, digital banking, and machine learning to bring more consumers into the financial system and upend how people spend, make, borrow, and exchange money.
“When you look underneath, there is true technological innovation,” Treyger said. “It’s really exciting to see that the dollars went into companies that have truly transformed the financial service sector.”
As just a few examples, Stripe and Square helped change the way businesses get paid, Lending Club and SoFi took on incumbents in the personal loan space, and Robinhood reinvented how everyday consumers invest.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The proposed 1.1 billion dollar (£880 million) sale of the dot-org online registry to an investment firm has been shelved following widespread opposition.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) board voted not to allow the sale to Ethos Capital of the website suffix that is widely used by non-profits and community groups.
Activists, politicians and hundreds of organisations had protested that costs for non-profits would rise and freedom of expression would be at risk if a for-profit company were in charge of dot-org, one of the original domains created in the 1980s.
Vetoing the sale is “reasonable, and the right thing to do,” said ICANN’s chairman Maarten Botterman in a blog post.
Mr Botterman noted the “fundamental public interest nature” of the organisation that currently oversees dot-org which wold have been transferred to one “bound to serve the interests of its corporate stakeholders” had the sale gone through.
He also expressed concern over what the debt involved in the transaction would mean for those dot-org users, which include public radio broadcaster NPR, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and medical humanitarian group Doctors without Borders.
Ethos Capital and the Internet Society, the nonprofit founded by many of the internet’s early engineers and scientists that currently runs the registry, had said concerns were misplaced.
The investment firm said in a statement that the decision “will suffocate innovation and deter future investment in the domain industry” and that it is evaluating its options.
The Internet Society said it is disappointed “that ICANN has acted as a regulatory body it was never meant to be”.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which had campaigned against the sale, said ICANN’s decision was a “stunning victory for nonprofits and NGOs around the world working in the public interest”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sale of internet's dot-org suffix nixed after protests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK — After widespread opposition, the organization overseeing internet domain names has voted against the $1.1 billion sale of the dot-org online registry to an investment firm.
The board of the Los Angeles-based Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers voted not to allow the sale to Ethos Capital of the website suffix that is widely used by non-profits and community groups.
Activists, politicians and hundreds of organizations had protested that costs for non-profits would rise and freedom of expression would be at risk if a for-profit company were in charge of dot-org, one of the original domains created in the mid-1980s.
Vetoing the sale is “reasonable, and the right thing to do,” said ICANN's chair, Maarten Botterman, in a blog post .
Botterman noted the “fundamental public interest nature” of the organization that currently oversees dot-org. That would have been transferred to one “bound to serve the interests of its corporate stakeholders” had the sale gone through, he said.
He also expressed concern over what the debt involved in the transaction would mean for those dot-org users, which include public radio broadcaster NPR, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and medical humanitarian group Doctors without Borders.
Ethos Capital and the Internet Society, the nonprofit founded by many of the internet’s early engineers and scientists that currently runs the registry, had said concerns were misplaced. Ethos had offered concessions including capping price hikes.
The investment firm said in a statement that the decision “will suffocate innovation and deter future investment in the domain industry” and that it is evaluating its options. The Internet Society said it is disappointed “that ICANN has acted as a regulatory body it was never meant to be.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">7 jobs that can earn you a 6-figure salary in the $4 trillion auto industry</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The global auto industry is, to be quite blunt, huge.
It generates trillions in annual revenue and keeps millions employed. 
The pay can also be pretty good. A unionized hourly worker at vehicle assembly plant in the US can bring home a mid-five-figure yearly total, and with seniority and overtime, get close to $100,000.
If you survey the entire industry, which supports everything from engineering to banking to insurance, you could easily find numerous six-figure salaries.
At the moment, with automakers enduring massive manufacturing shutdowns and undertaking layoffs to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, employment in the industry is in limbo. But demand for cars isn't likely to vanish, so these careers remain good bets.
Here's a sampling:
"F&I" is auto-industry shorthand for "finance and insurance." If you've ever bought or leased a vehicle from an auto dealer, you've most likely interacted with an F&I professional. They're the last stage in the purchasing process, where you're walked through the details of your lease or loan, warranty, given the opportunity to buy into extras that are dealership-exclusive, deal with local DMV regulations and paperwork, and can have insurance coverage arranged.
Sometimes, your dealer will introduce you to an F&I staffer during the buying process to review lease and loan options. The dealership, if it's franchised to sell major brands (Toyota, Ford, Cadillac, Mercedes, and so on), should have access to an automaker's captive-finance arm, as well as a bunch of banks that can make loans to buyers of varying creditworthiness.
Almost nobody walks into a dealership with bag of cash, so an F&I manager has a very big job: he or she needs to figure how people from all walks of life can get across the car-buying/leasing finish line.
Dealers make money from selling cars, but they make their real profits acting as loan brokers, insurance brokers, and by selling things like extended warranties to customers. That's why the F&I manager is well compensated — NADA reckons on average almost $133,000 a year — and often has received special training or a certification.
The range is what one might expect here: designers at the beginning of their careers make less than six figures, but the pay is still good, in the mid-fives.
Once you get some seniority, six figures is in sight. And if you become a major name in the field or oversee all design operations for a large automaker, you can rack up a lot more than $100,000.
An experienced designer at a top auto brand should spend his or her days dealing with a team of fellow designers, meeting with the engineers who are determining how a vehicle is going to get built, and spending a lot of time sketching ideas, refining those ideas using computers drafting programs, and in some cases creating physical clay models and even making full-size "tape" drawings on walls. And not all designers work on exteriors — everything from seats to sun visors also have to be developed.
Most car designers have graduated from a transportation-design program, such as the one at California's Art Center College of Design, whose alumni include Tesla's Franz von Holzhausen, Acura's Michelle Christensen, and the controversial Chris Bangle, formerly of BMW.
Becoming an engineer has always been a great path to a good starting salary. But if you stick with the gig and labor in, say, the Detroit area for General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, you could expect to hit $120,000 if you achieve some seniority. (The BLS reports that the top 10% can earn almost $137,000.)
By that point, you won't be tinkering with turbochargers any longer, but rather overseeing a group of tinkerers.
Keep at it and satisfy the boss' demands and you could become the boss yourself. Then you become a manager and might be assigned an entire vehicle to launch. At a company such as Ford, high-pressure engineering roles involve new Mustangs and pickup trucks.
Engineers typically have four-year degrees from colleges that are known for feeding into the car business, but grad-school isn't a requirement. Often, however, those with their sights on becoming executives will get MBAs.
The median salary for an electrical engineer is about $95,000, so more senior folks could easily top $100,000.
Demand for electrical engineers should dramatically increase in the coming decade as automakers shift from internal-combustion powerplants to EVs. The industry already employs electrical engineers, but going forward, battery designs and electric propulsion are going to require additional talent.
The relative simplicity of EVs compared to gas vehicles doesn't mean they aren't complicated in   other ways. Tesla, for example, has battery packs that require thousands of lithium-ion cells, all wired together and managed with software.
Becoming a professional gearhead is actually not a bad career move, as skilled mechanics can make $40-50,000 annually.
But as with other jobs in the rundown, the more experience and expertise you amass, the more you get paid. Master mechanics who have some years under their tool belts and have been trained and certified for complicated service and repair procedures are in demand and can command $100,000-and-up wages.
College degrees aren't requires, and shortage of mechanics has some vocational schools stressing the potentially big-time paydays for trained mechanics.
 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the median yearly salary for a software developer is $110,000. And while you might think that the auto industry needs mechanical engineers more than folks who can wrangle code, you'd be mistaken.
In fact, as cars become more and more like rolling computers, and as companies such as Cruise, Waymo, and Tesla strive to crack the challenge of autonomous vehicles, a massive talent hunt is on in the world's auto capitals to hire software engineers.
Some professionals could be trying to teach cars to drive themselves, but others could spend their days developing testing programs, supporting manufacturing teams and robotics efforts, or figuring out new ways to provide wireless connectivity to vehicles.
In the good old days, trains loaded with iron ore would roll up to one side of Ford's famous River Rouge factory and finished cars would roll out the other side.
But ever since the 1980s, such highly vertical manufacturing has been supplanted by so-called "lean" or "just in time" systems, with parts arriving as they're needed rather than being stockpiled in inventory.
To make this process work for companies that do business around the world, the supply chain manager has entered the picture and taken on a critically important role. So important that various salary-tracking websites rank this job as one of the industry's best-paying.
A degree in lots of fields can get you started, but areas such as business administration, math, economics, engineering, or science should expose you to the level of detail and organization you'd need to thrive in supply chain management.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett's firm plans online event after reporting US$50B loss</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OMAHA, NEB. -- Warren Buffett is planning to lead an unusual annual meeting Saturday afternoon without any of the roughly 40,000 shareholders who typically attend, but the investor will offer some of the commentary that draws the huge crowds.
Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting will be livestreamed and will include an abbreviated version of the question-and-answer session Buffett normally leads. All of the surrounding events, including a trade show where Berkshire companies sell their products, were cancelled this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, and Buffett will have a different partner for the question session.
"It's going to be a strange annual meeting," said Andy Kilpatrick, a retired stockbroker who wrote a Buffett biography and has attended every annual meeting since 1985.
Instead of sitting next to business partner Charlie Munger in an arena filled with shareholders, Buffett will be joined this year by Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel, who oversees all of the company's non-insurance businesses, to answer questions in front of a camera.
The two men likely will be asked about the nearly US$50 billion loss that Berkshire reported Saturday morning and the huge pile of cash the company is holding.
Berkshire said it lost $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, during the first quarter. That's down from last year's profit of $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per Class A share.
The biggest factor in the loss was a $54.5 billion loss on the value of Berkshire's investment portfolio as the stock market declined sharply after the coronavirus outbreak began. The year before, Berkshire's investments added $15.5 billion to the company's profits.
Buffett has long said Berkshire's operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings improved to $5.87 billion, or $3,617.62 per Class A share, from $5.56 billion, or $3,387.56 per Class A share.
Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected operating earnings per Class A share of $3,796.90 on average.
Berkshire's revenue grew 1 per cent to $61.27 billion. The company said revenue slowed considerably in April as the virus outbreak negatively affected most of its businesses. Berkshire closed several of its retail businesses, such as See's Candy and the Nebraska Furniture Mart, this spring while BNSF railroad and its insurance and utility businesses continued operating.
Berkshire is sitting on a pile of more than $137 billion cash because Buffett has struggled to find major acquisitions for the company recently. Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said it was striking that Buffett didn't find any bargains to invest in at the end of the first quarter.
"The lack of investment activity really sticks out," Shanahan said.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns more than 90 companies, including the railroad and insurance, utility, furniture and jewelry businesses. The company also has major investments in such companies as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Bank of America.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What Warren Buffett Said at Berkshire Hathaway's 2020 Shareholder Meeting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett is the most closely followed investor in the world, and every year, shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) look forward to hearing what the Oracle of Omaha has to say. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, however, the tens of thousands of people who would ordinarily descend on Nebraska's largest city to see Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting have instead had to settle for a live-streamed remote event.
Despite not being able to invite shareholders to join him in person, Buffett nevertheless wanted to be sure to keep the lines of communication with investors open. Berkshire's chairman and CEO had plenty to say, answering questions compiled by well-known financial journalists and addressing some of the most important issues that Buffett's followers have had on their minds lately. Here are some of the most interesting things Buffett had to say at the May 2 shareholder meeting.
Buffett has always believed in America, and nothing about the coronavirus pandemic has changed his views on that. He gave an extended history lesson about the nation, pointing to the challenges it's faced in the past and the way in which it has overcome them.
Buffett has no illusions that he can predict where stocks will be tomorrow, next week, next month, or even next year. But he thinks America in 2020 is in better shape than it's been at any other time in its history, and he believes that investors who put money in stocks for the long run now will be amply rewarded.
Buffett has famously said that he suggests that a perfectly good way for investors to participate in the gradual rise of the stock market over time is to invest in an S&P 500 index fund. With low expenses, index funds can give investors exposure to a wide swath of the businesses that have been responsible for America's economic success over the decades.
Indeed, investing in an index fund isn't just a bet on the success of America. With so many multinational companies in the S&P 500, index funds give you ownership in the companies that are finding success around the globe.
On a related topic, one reason Buffett advises index funds is that they're inexpensive. Too many people pay large amounts of money for financial advice, and Buffett is critical of the performance that most financial advisors are able to achieve. Buffett believes that most salespeople in the financial industry aren't able to deliver superior results, despite the fact that those salespeople generally "believe their own baloney," in his words.
Another reason Buffett likes stocks right now is that the alternatives aren't very good. U.S. Treasury bonds with 30-year maturities yield just 1.25%. Berkshire itself has taken advantage of low interest rates by borrowing money at zero interest rates.
Buffett thinks America's economic tailwinds will persist. But when all it takes to beat 30-year Treasuries is to match the rate of inflation, it's even more of a no-brainer in the Berkshire chief's views to invest in stocks instead.
There's been a lot of speculation about the moves that Berkshire Hathaway has recently made with its airline stock holdings. In early April, Berkshire sold substantial amounts of its holdings in Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), with disclosures necessary because of Berkshire's having held more than 10% of the two airlines' outstanding shares. At the time, it seemed as though Buffett might simply be reducing its positions below 10% to avoid future complications.
However, Buffett reported selling a total of $6.5 billion in stock during April, far more than the Delta and Southwest sales that had been reported and also including shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) as well. Questioned later, the Berkshire CEO said that the company sold off its entire positions in the four airlines. As he explained it, he "just decided I made a mistake." He had initially figured that investing $7 billion to $8 billion to buy 10% stakes in the four biggest U.S. airlines would give him about $1 billion in underlying earnings, which seemed like a reasonable value. However, Buffett said, "It turned out I was wrong about the business."
Buffett didn't blame airline CEOs, who managed their companies well and did a lot of things right. However, the Berkshire leader no longer feels comfortable that airlines will ever recover to their pre-coronavirus levels, and even two to three years from now, it's possible that not nearly as many people will be flying. Unfortunately, even if airlines recover 70% to 80% of their pre-crisis passenger loads, they'll still have far too many planes. With airlines selling stock to raise capital, upside is limited. Buffett concluded, "The world changed for airlines, and we wish them well."
Buffett has an optimistic attitude that investors around the globe find compelling. Even with all the uncertainty related to the coronavirus pandemic, the Oracle of Omaha's general demeanor was positive.
For those who have been near panic as a result of the bear market in February and March, listening to Buffett can restore confidence in the stock market as a creator of long-term wealth. No matter what happens to the stock market in the months to come -- or to Berkshire's share price on Monday -- Buffett's words will provide reassurance and remind us how we've always managed to overcome difficult challenges in the past -- and will again this time.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The subsequent share drop erased around $13 billion from Tesla's market value and nearly $3 billion from the value of Musk's stake. Still, shares remain up almost 50% from the start of April
Shares of Tesla Inc tumbled 9% on Friday after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted that the electric carmaker's high-flying stock was overly expensive.
"Tesla stock price is too high," Musk said on Twitter in one of several unusual messages, including ones quoting parts of the U.S. national anthem and that he would sell almost all his physical possessions.
The subsequent share drop erased around $13 billion from Tesla's market value and nearly $3 billion from the value of Musk's stake. Still, shares remain up almost 50% from the start of April.
More than two hours after the tweets began, Tesla had not responded to requests for comment. Twitter declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had responded to an email asking whether he was joking or whether his tweet was vetted by saying, "No".
Musk has a history of sending provocative tweets. In August 2018, he tweeted that he had secured funding to possibly take Tesla private at a big premium, which led a fraud case by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk settled by agreeing to pay $20 million and have a Tesla lawyer pre-screen tweets with important information about the company.
Last month, a federal judge said Tesla and Musk must face a lawsuit by shareholders over the going-private tweet, including a claim that Musk intended to defraud them.
In April 2019 Musk tweeted, "My Twitter is pretty much complete nonsense at this point."
"We view these Musk comments as tongue in cheek and it's Elon being Elon. It's certainty a headache for investors for him to venture into this area as his tweeting remains a hot button issue and the Street clearly is frustrated," Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said by email.
Tesla's stock has surged in recent weeks, but is down since Wednesday after the company reported an unexpected quarterly profit, despite manufacturing interruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Musk's latest tweets follow others this week. On Tesla's quarterly conference call on Wednesday, he called sweeping U.S. stay-at-home restrictions to curtail the coronavirus outbreak "fascist". Those restrictions have forced Tesla to shutter its car plant in Fremont, California.
"Musk has recently expressed some strong and, at times, controversial, views on COVID-19 and some elements of the response to the crisis and we believe is attempting to use his broad following and visibility to bring attention to some economic factors that he believes may be overlooked," Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a client note on Friday.
Musk's iconoclastic stance has helped him attract over 33 million followers on Twitter and is seen as a marketing boon for Tesla.
Tesla's recent rally has put Musk on the verge of a payday of over $700 million. The six-month average of Tesla's market capitalization is just short of $100 billion, a target that would trigger the vesting of a tranche of options granted to Musk to buy 1.69 million shares as part of his two-year-old pay package.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) — Shares of Tesla tumbled 9% on Friday after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the electric carmaker’s high-flying stock was overly expensive. “Tesla stock price is too high,” Musk said on Twitter in one of several unusual messages, including ones quoting parts of the U.S. national anthem and saying that he would sell almost all his physical possessions.
The subsequent share drop erased around $13 billion from Tesla’s market value and nearly $3 billion from the value of Musk’s stake. Still, shares remain up almost 50% from the start of April.
More than two hours after the tweets began, Tesla had not responded to requests for comment. Twitter declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had responded to an email asking whether he was joking or whether his tweet was vetted by saying, “No.”
Musk has a history of sending provocative tweets. In August 2018, he tweeted that he had secured funding to possibly take Tesla private at a big premium, which led to a fraud case by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk settled by agreeing to pay $20 million and have a Tesla lawyer prescreen tweets with important information about the company.
Last month, a federal judge said Tesla and Musk must face a lawsuit by shareholders over the going-private tweet, including a claim that Musk intended to defraud them. In April 2019, Musk tweeted, “My Twitter is pretty much complete nonsense at this point.”
“We view these Musk comments as tongue in cheek, and it’s Elon being Elon. It’s [certainly] a headache for investors for him to venture into this area as his tweeting remains a hot button issue and the Street clearly is frustrated,” Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said by email.
Tesla’s stock has surged in recent weeks but is down since Wednesday after the company reported an unexpected quarterly profit, despite manufacturing interruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Musk’s latest tweets follow others this week. On Tesla’s quarterly conference call on Wednesday, he called sweeping U.S. stay-at-home restrictions to curtail the coronavirus outbreak “fascist.” Those restrictions have forced Tesla to shutter its car plant in Fremont, California.
“Musk has recently expressed some strong and, at times, controversial, views on COVID-19 and some elements of the response to the crisis and we believe is attempting to use his broad following and visibility to bring attention to some economic factors that he believes may be overlooked,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a client note on Friday.
Musk’s iconoclastic stance has helped him attract over 33 million followers on Twitter and is seen as a marketing boon for Tesla. Tesla’s recent rally has put Musk on the verge of a payday of over $700 million. The six-month average of Tesla’s market capitalization is just short of $100 billion, a target that would trigger the vesting of a tranche of options granted to Musk to buy 1.69 million shares as part of his two-year-old pay package.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As and when it is over and we are out of the lockdown, the first desire everywhere will be to return to what we had, the Old Normal, regardless of its many problems. Everyone will need to feel that the dreaded epidemic has been eliminated and they can live again as they used to.
This is Repair. It involves helping many groups of people whose lives have been severely disrupted. All the people laid off due to the economy being shut down will need help with resuming their old life. Governments at the state level cannot help as they have been hit by loss of revenue due to the shutting down of alcohol shops and the drop in petrol sales, two sturdy sources of revenue. Only the Centre can help here.
The Old Normal was a phase of growth recession. The Budget had already acknowledged the need for a fiscal stimulus. Now, as all other economies are doing, a massive reflation will be necessary to accomplish the tasks of repair, restoration and renewal. Restoration will be the urgent step which will take the economy back to a growth path.

The most needy group is the urban workers in the informal sector, especially the migrants. These migrants have returned to their native areas lately with help from their ‘original’ states. Now to bring them back should be the Centre’s task as far as financing is concerned. Ideally, the Centre should compensate the states which have paid to bring ‘their’ migrants back home.
The next task is to build a welfare state suitable to Indian conditions. Modi 1.0 began the task of providing health care, financial inclusion, digital access. MUDRA provided financial help for businesses run by women, Dalits, tribals. The need now is to address the biggest gap left by 70 years of economic policy — the large pool of the unemployed. The need is for a temporary unemployment benefit scheme for up to 100 days a year similar to the MNREGS so that urban workers do not suffer during short periods of unemployment. This will establish parity between rural and urban poor.
Opinion | When all this is over, it really is important that big bosses of Indian journalism urge season of introspection
Modi 1.0 also provided for rural housing on a large scale. The plight of migrant workers points to the need for urban housing. A massive programme of urban housing at affordable rents for eligible working families is needed across the large and small cities. Dharavi has been much romanticised in books and films. It should be a blot on Mumbai and India. The advantage of housing as a public infrastructure investment is its capacity for job creation as well as tackling homelessness. Given the large unfulfilled demand, this will have to be a multi-year investment project.
This housing programme will help resume growth and sustain it over a long period. But there is a need to renew industrial growth. Over the last 70-plus years, India has frittered chances to become a centre of manufacturing on the scale of other Asian countries. This was due to labour laws which protected the small formal sector. This has led to the overhang of unemployment. The disruption of global supply chains during the pandemic creates tremendous opportunities to reindustrialise India. No previous government has been equal to this challenge. Modi 1.0 launched Make in India. Now is the chance for renewal.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Internet companies like Urban Company, MakeMyTrip, Dunzo, HealthifyMe and Zomato are changing their social media handles and app icons to promote wearing face masks as a hygiene practice amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Apna Mask initiative -- an effort by StartUpVsCOVID (a startup community with over 1,000 members) -- is promoting homemade masks and aims to drive behavioural change to ensure that people wear masks and stay protected as they step out of their homes.
The #ApnaDeshApnaMask campaign was kicked off by startup industry stalwarts like Rajan Anandan of Sequoia India, Paytm's Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Alok Mittal (Indifi), Vishal Gondal (GoQii) and others. They were later joined by celebrities like Vidya Balan, Dia Mirza, Juhi Chawla, Divya Khosla Kumar, Juhi Parmar, Deepshika Deshmukh, Sonu Sood, Shama Sikander, Preetika Rao and others.
Within a span of two weeks, the initiative has garnered 100 million outreach across digital platforms, including WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
The team working on the campaign also reached out to various organisations to support the initiative, especially as parts of the country get ready to come out of the lockdown which has been extended till May 17.
"Urban Company, MakemyTrip, Dunzo, HealthifyMe, Zomato, Redbus, Ixigo, MoneyTap, MyUpchaar, Bounce, RazorPay, Medanta, WittyFeed, LBB, Porter, Meesho, Daily Hunt, 1mg, Paytm Games have changed their social media handles while some are changing the app icons as well," a statement said.
These brands are also inviting more companies to join the initiative.
"Given the immense response we have received, we will have more brands join #ApnaMask in this critical initiative. We believe some of these steps will be helpful in building habit changing behaviour towards wearing homemade masks," Poonam Kaul, co-founder of ApnaMask, said.
In a separate statement, Crowdera -- an online fundraising platform -- said it is offering its premium syndicated fundraising technology solutions for free to companies and NGOs working to help the COVID-19 affected individuals, families and health workers.
"Crowdera will be extending its support through offering its products and services worth almost USD 150,000 (Rs 1 crore) free to organisations aiding the affected...The solution will help corporations and NGOs to quickly syndicate with their own employees, influencers, other foundations, or charity partners to raise funds 10X more than through a regular crowdfunding campaign," it said.  
Under this pledge, Crowdera has already extended its support to companies like Rapido, Repos, BYJU'S, SirfTaxi, and Tartl to engage their employees and partners in fundraising for the COVID-affected workforce.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global experts predict worldwide recession of 1.9% in 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berlin: Around 1,000 economic experts from 110-odd countries and regions expect a global recession at 1.9 per cent in 2020 due to the coronavirus crisis, according to a survey published by Germany's influential Ifo institute on Thursday.With a global recession of this magnitude, it was "lowest number since the survey began in 1989," the ifo researchers noted.Europe has been hit "particularly hard" as the gross domestic product (GDP) in the 19-member eurozone is expected to fall by 5.3 per cent in 2020, according to the ifo survey.Within the eurozone, the recession is expected to be the most severe in Italy with a 7-per cent decline. For both Germany and France, the experts predict a GDP decrease of 5 per cent, according to the survey.
Only a few countries, such as China and India, are expected to increase their economic output albeit at "historically" low rates, the ifo noted.Economic output in the United States is expected to fall by 4.6 per cent. GDP would decrease by 4.2 per cent in Brazil and by 3.4 per cent in Russia and South Africa each. Japan would experience a 3.3 per cent recession, according to the survey.The pandemic has had a negative impact on worldwide economic activity through a "variety of different channels," the ifo found. Investment cutbacks, in particular, have had a significantly negative impact.Rising national budget deficits, lower consumer spending, company closures as well as production stops, quarantine measures and disruptions in international supply chains further impeded the global economy, according to the ifo survey.However, the experts surveyed by the ifo considered potential bankruptcies of banks a minor issue only, the survey found.Liquidity support for small and large companies, tax deferrals for companies as well as the purchase of securities by central banks and temporary reductions in value-added tax (VAT) are considered "helpful countermeasures" during the COVID-19 crisis.In the emerging and developing countries, 34 per cent of the experts surveyed believed that a return to a "pre-crisis performance level" would already happen this year. For the European Union (EU), on the other hand, only 6.7 per cent of the experts expected an upswing as early as in 2020

    <h5 class="mb-1">Canada’s economy is in recession due to Covid-19 impact: Report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A leading Canadian think tank has projected that the country’s economy is now in recession thanks to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Toronto-based C D Howe Institute’s Business Cycle Council made this official even as it stated that the first quarter of 2020 was historic in the sense that the country recorded its highest ever drop in GDP, at a 2.6 per cent fall. Statistics Canada has estimated that Canada’s GDP took a nine per cent hit in March alone, as the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis rattled the economy with several sectors being shut down. March also saw a 5.3 per cent drop in employment in the nation.

The Council’s decision to declare a recession was based on preliminary data available on April 30 and it stated that while revisions to GDP figures will occur, they are “extremely unlikely to be significant enough to alter the recession call.”
This sobering announcement came as the country recorded over 55,000 Covid-19 cases with 3,391 deaths.
Already, nearly seven million Canadians, approximately a fifth of the country’s population, have availed of an emergency fund established by the Government to counter the adverse economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. A note published by the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated that total could increase by 20 per cent, to about 8.5 million using the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which was announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and is scheduled to last four months, beginning with March.

With a subsidy programme also being introduced to support businesses in retaining employees, the budget deficit will go over CA$ 252 billion. Decisions on how the Government will deal with the looming economic crisis have yet to be made, and Trudeau made it clear that facing the current challenges caused by Covid-19 will remain the priority for the short-term. Right now, he said during a media briefing after a session of Parliament, the “focus is on getting through this together as a country.”
“There will be time after this is all done as we figure out how exactly this unfolds, where we will have to make next decisions on how that recovery looks,” he said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Customers need to submit details such as their contact information, geographical location, choice of vehicle variant, colour, powertrain and transmission. After reconfirmation, they can proceed to paying the booking amount via online payment options
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) India on Saturday announced the launch of its online 'touch-free' Jeep retail experience in response to continued movement restrictions and social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic. Prospective customers can book and own a Jeep online without having to physically visit a showroom, and will enjoy the convenience of a test drive and sanitized vehicle delivery at their doorstep, the company said in a statement.
FCA India President and Managing Director Partha Datta said, "Our commitment is to ensure customers can still continue to access Jeep at their fingertips. To ensure health, safety and convenience, we are making the Jeep retail experience as touch-free as possible."
The online booking is being dovetailed into a 360-degree digital retail architecture that will deliver easy-to-use experience for customers and prospective customers can book and own a Jeep without leaving the safety of their homes, he added.
Customers need to submit details such as their contact information, geographical location, choice of vehicle variant, colour, powertrain and transmission. After reconfirmation, they can proceed to paying the booking amount via online payment options.
Afterwards, FCA's automated retail architecture will automatically create a unique ID and link the customer's information to its authorized dealer in that city and a sales executive will assist the customer for test drive, booking and final payment, the company added.
"The touch-free retail experience is designed to enhance convenience for customers. Physical distancing has become the new normal and keeping this in mind, our approach is to ensure customers as well as our dealer showroom staff are well protected," Datta said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">F&O data denotes modest support for Nifty</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Drop in volatility coupled with higher Put-Call ratio indicates a possible bounce in the week ahead for the May derivatives series
Drop in volatility coupled with higher Put-Call ratio indicates a possible bounce in the week ahead for the May derivatives series. Short covering and rollovers to May F&O series added to the gains.
The options band is expected to be 9,000-10,200 range. However, F&O data indicates that no strong Call writing seen at immediate strikes of the previous closing, said analysts.
On the options front, At The Money (ATM) strike of Call and Put holds significant Open Interest (OI) and it reveals the trading in the range of 9,500-9,750 levels.
Maximum Call OI of 27.47 lakh contracts was seen at 9,900 strike, which also recorded highest OI addition of 22.82 lakh contracts, followed by 10,000 strike with 25.40 lakh contracts, 9,000 strike with 9.77 lakh contracts and 11,000 strike with 9.95 lakh contracts. Highest Call OI winding up was recorded at 9,500 / 9,600 / 9,700 strikes.
Marginal OI buildup is seen above 9,950 level. This clearly indicates that support level for NSE Nifty is moving up, but in a modest way, observe analysts.
Dhirender Singh Bisht, senior research analyst (derivatives) at SMC Global Securities Ltd, said: "From the derivatives front, the Call writers at 9,500 strike trigger sharp short covering, which is propelling the Nifty to move towards 9,900 levels."
Coming to Put side, highest Put OI of 26.43 lakh contracts recorded at 9,000 strike followed by 9,800 strike, which recorded maximum OI addition of 22.49 lakh contracts, with 23.01 lakh contracts, 9500 strike with 18.43 lakh contracts and 9,850 strike with 18 lakh contracts. Further, 9,700-9,850 zone witnessed reasonable Put OI buildup.
April derivatives series concluded on Thursday as Nifty recorded 14.1 per cent gain, highest since May 2009. Nifty rollover into May derivatives series stood at 60 per cent as against 59 per cent in previous month, while Bank Nifty rollover increased to 67 per cent for May F&O series from 52 per cent for April series.
Overall rollover is at 71.29 per cent, higher than previous 68.69 per cent. But the rollover was with low base of OI and OI declined by 17 per cent on expiry-to-expiry comparison, said analysts.
"Once again bulls made a comeback in Indian markets and Nifty and Bank Nifty both the indices soared high in the week gone by majorly taking cues from firm global markets as positive results for experimental Remdesivir drug for Covid-19 treatment lifted the sentiment," said Bisht.
For the week ended April 30, 2020, (holiday on May 1), BSE Sensex closed at 33,717.62 points, a net gain of 2,390.40 points or 7.63 per cent, from the previous close of 31,327.22 points.
Similarly, NSE Nifty too recovered by 705.5 points or 7.70 percent, and closed the week at 9,859.90 points as against last week's at 9,154.409,266.75 points.
"For coming week, however, now 9,500-9,400 zone would act as a key support for the markets, while 10,000 would act as psychological level for Nifty on higher side.
From the technical front, the secondary oscillators suggest further upside into the prices in coming sessions and traders should use any dip as a buying opportunity," forecasts Bisht.
India VIX continued to ease in the seventh consecutive session and five weeks in a row as it declined by 0.43 per cent to 33.99.
"The Implied Volatility of Calls closed at 29.68 per cent, while Put options closed at 31.43 per cent.
The Nifty VIX for the week closed at 33.99 per cent and is expected to remain volatile. PCR OI for the week closed at 2.09 up as compared to last week at 1.59, which indicates Put writing," maintained Bisht.
According to ICICI Direct.com, stocks that recorded long buildup and short covering included HDFC Ltd, Apollo Tyres, SBI, Infosys, Sail, Hindalco and HDFC Bank.
Select stocks such as Cummins India, HPCL, Nestlé India, Berger Paints, Cipla, Voltas and Hindustan Unilever witnessed short buildup and profit booking.
FPIs bought worth Rs722 crore, while DIIs bought Rs786 crore in the cash segment. FPIs sold index futures worth Rs66 crore and bought Rs423 cr in index options, as per data from ICICI Direct.com.
Bank Nifty
Gaining by 1,947.85 points or 9.94 per cent for the week, Bank Nifty closed at 21,534.50 points as against 19,586.65 points.
"Banking index, however, outperformed the other sectors as hefty short covering was seen from lower levels with HDFC and HDFC Bank remained among top performers in the financial sector," added Bisht.
The Nifty is expected to trade between 9,500 and 9,750 levels amid high volatility in Bank Nifty Futures. In the stock futures segment, FPIs bought worth Rs478 crore.
Banking stocks continued their upward march for a third consecutive session.
The Bank Nifty in the last session rose 1.5 per cent to close above its resistance level of 21,000, led by HDFC Bank while follow-up buying was also witnessed in midcap as well as PSU banks.
After the breakout from the broader trading range of 19,000 and 21,000, analysts hold the view that Bank Nifty may continue towards 21,700.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Index Outlook | Sensex, Nifty 50 poised at crucial levels</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In sync with global markets, the domestic equity indices witnessed s strong rally in the past week. The short-covering on April month expiry also pushed the key benchmark indices — the Sensex and the Nifty — higher.
However, the US and Asian markets experienced selling pressure on Friday, which may get reflected in the domestic indices with a weak opening this week. Selling interest and profit-booking can keep the benchmark indices under pressure.
Therefore, investors should thread with caution in the coming weeks.
The Nifty 50 index skyrocketed 705 points, or 7.7 per cent, in the truncated week, decisively breaching a key short-term, trend-deciding level in the 9,500-9,600 band.
But it faces another crucial resistance ahead at the 10,000 mark.
The week ahead: Last week, the Nifty extended the rally by initially surpassing the immediate resistance at 9,280 and, thereafter, it breached the aforementioned band. However, the index has a significant barrier on its onward journey, at 10,000. An emphatic break above this hurdle is needed to strengthen the short-term uptrend that commenced from the March low of 7,511. An emphatic break above 10,000 can push the index northwards to 10,335 and then to 10,500 in the coming weeks.
If the index fails to move beyond 10,000, a pull-back can be witnessed and it can fill the gap formed on Thursday by declining to 9,600 levels.
A conclusive fall below the next support level of 9,400 will bring back selling pressure on the back of profit-taking and drag the index further to down to 9,100 and then to 9,000.
An empathic plunge below the 8,800 will the mar the short-term uptrend and pull the index to 8,600 and then to 8,400 levels. The key resistances above 10,500 are at 10,750 and 10,830.
We reaffirm that a decisive tumble below the psychological base level of 8,000 can strengthen the downtrend and pull the index down to 7,800 and 7,500 levels.
Medium term: The index continues to be in a medium-term downtrend as long as it trades below the crucial medium-term resistance in the 10,000-10,150 band. A strong break above this band will alter the downtrend and pave the way for an upmove to 10,335 and 10,500 over the medium term.
The next medium-term resistances are pegged at 10,750 and 11,000. On the other hand, key level of 9,000 could provide base. But a slump below this support will underpin the downtrend and pull the index down to the subsequent key medium-term support at 8,400.
The supports below this level are at 8,000 and 7,500.
The Sensex jumped 2,390 points, or 7.6 per cent, in the previous week, surpassing a crucial barrier at 33,000. This level can act as a key support now.
Going forward, the Sensex faces a significant resistance at 34,000 and 34,500 levels.
A strong break above this resistances will reinforce the bullish momentum and take the index northwards to 35,000 and then to 35,500 levels.
Conversely, if the index fails to take support at 33,000, a decline to 32,500 and then to 32,000 is possible in the ensuing weeks. The supports below 32,000 are at 31,000 and 30,500. But the on-going short-term uptrend will be mitigated if the index decisively breaks below the psychological support level of 30,000; the supports at 29,000 and 28,500 will come into play.
As long as the index trades above 29,500, the short-term uptrend that started from the March low of 25,638 will stay intact. Investors with a long-term view can buy in dips with a revised stop-loss at 27,500.
Last week, the Nifty Bank jumped 1,947 points, or almost 10 per cent, outperforming the bellwether indices. This rally surpassed a vital resistance at 21,000, but the index faces a key hurdle at 22,000.
A strong break above this level is required to strengthen the short-term uptrend and take the index northwards to 23,000 in the coming weeks. Having said that, a fall below the immediate support level of 21,000 can pull the index lower to 20,500 and then to 20,000 levels.
A further decline below 20,000 can drag it down to 19,000. Traders should tread with caution as long as the index is range-bound between 21,000 and 22,000.
A break above 22,000 will be a cue for initiating fresh long positions with a fixed stop-loss.
Equally, if the index falls below 21,000, traders can go short with a fixed stop-loss. The key supports below 19,000 are placed at 18,500 and 18,000. A plunge below the short-term, trending-deciding level of 19,000 will mar the current uptrend.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index tumbled 2.5 per cent on Friday, eroding the initial gains, and closed marginally in the negative territory at 23,723 in the previous week. The index tests a key resistance at 24,000.
To strengthen the bullish momentum, a decisive break above this level is needed. In such a scenario, it can rally to 24,500 and then to 25,000. The immediate supports are at 23,500 and 23,000 levels.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Customers skip the line as warehouse, sample sales shift online amid pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VANCOUVER — Last year, more than 2,000 shoppers descended on a Toronto pop-up store, looking for deals at undergarment maker Knix's first warehouse sale. It was a success: the company sold out of most items during the three-day event and needed to double its staffing.
Knix planned a bigger event for April 2020 at a space four times larger, but scrapped that plan in favour of a virtual sale as the COVID-19 pandemic created insurmountable challenges for an in-person event.
"That became clear when we went to remote work and closed our stores," said founder and chief executive officer Joanna Griffiths.
Some retailers known for annual warehouse or seasonal sample sales are shifting those events online amid the pandemic and finding the digital switch offers new benefits such as broader customer reach, lower overhead and more consumer insights.
For Knix, the virtual event outstripped last year's in-person sale.
About 3,000 customers waited for the Knix site to go live at 10 a.m. April 23, the company said.
It sold more items in the first 10 minutes of this year's sale than over the three-day event in March 2019, and in just over an hour its sales outdid all of Black Friday. In the first 30 minutes, it rung up $500,000 in sales.
The success was welcome after the scramble to quickly shift the event online.
The company hustled to build two new websites for the virtual sale — one for Canadian consumers and one for Americans. It worked with its fulfillment centre, which was originally going to transport garments to the warehouse sale, to move inventory into the online system instead.
One of the biggest challenges to navigate would be managing the assortment of items.
The company had to work to remove or hide products from the website quickly as they run out, said Griffiths, to avoid frustrating customers.
Customers also couldn't try items on before committing to a final sale, meaning no returns allowed. Knix planned to make staff available for online support to help shoppers select sizes.
Sizing items virtually was also an issue for Hilary MacMillan, a Toronto-based womenswear brand, at a digital sample earlier this month.
The fashion brand founded in 2013 holds several such in-person events each year and had one planned for the end of April, said Lindsay Ditkofsky, the company's vice-president of brand development.
The coronavirus pandemic prompted the label to shift the sale online. The label, which sells runway samples initially created to clothe models much taller than the average consumer, knew sizing could be problematic in the virtual space.
"There's always a challenge when it comes to how does something fit a body," said Ditkofsky, adding the company attempted to overcome that problem by providing detailed item descriptions and accurate size charts.
Knix realized the online process would be smoother for customers in some ways.
In 2019, eager customers lined up around an entire block of downtown Toronto. With a virtual sale, there's no waiting in line, Griffiths said.
Shoppers didn't have to navigate a large space filled with clothes either. All the products were laid out neatly online with about 20 staff available over live chat to answer questions.
This makes for an easier shopping experience, said Griffiths.
Hilary MacMillan saw some benefits to the business as well.
"Any time you do something digital, there's sort of a paper trail," said Ditkofsky.
Website analytics showed the company where visitors were located, how many were coming to the site for the first time and other metrics that a brick-and-mortar sale doesn't provide, she said.
It also allowed the company to reach more customers than just those near its Toronto studio space, which it uses for the sales and personal appointments.
"We reached a totally new level of customer that we haven't been able to touch before with this kind of event."
Griffiths has started suggesting to her industry peers that they should think about moving warehouse sales online as well, though she's yet to hear of another company planning a similar move.
Vancouver-based clothing retailer Aritzia Inc. holds an annual, multi-day warehouse sale in Vancouver. The company declined an interview request.
"At this point, no decisions have been made regarding our warehouse sale," wrote Anna Cordon, senior manager of public relations.
For Knix and Hilary MacMillan, the switch to a virtual warehouse sale may become permanent.
Griffiths expects the company will hold next year's event online regardless of whether physical distancing restrictions are still in place.
"Now that we've done all this work and ... we think it's better for so many reasons, I think this will be a virtual, annual thing," she said.
The fashion label, on the other hand, wants to incorporate the digital component while continuing in-person events, said Ditkofsky.
Both women believe Canadian consumers, who are often criticized for lagging behind Americans in e-commerce, will become more comfortable shopping online during the pandemic, especially as more retailers move their stores online and finesse the digital experience.
"I think that Canadians are more comfortable shopping online than we give them credit for," said Griffiths.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You recently wrote that I can change our family home to joint ownership by doing this "personally". Could you tell me how to do this? Our house in Melbourne is in my name because my husband was in business and requested that I be the nominal owner. He conducted this business in a home office on the ground floor of the residence. If we sell the house, which has appreciated somewhat since we occupied it, the office part will attract a sizeable Capital Gains Tax (CGT) amount, as it is about one third of the "footprint" of the property. My thinking is that if the house was in both our names we could spread the CGT between our two incomes, a small part of which is from the aged pension. J.T.
In NSW, the State Revenue website is informative, telling us that if a family home is also used for other purposes, the duty exemption for transfers between spouses will only apply to the residential part of the home, unless only one room was being used for the business.
In Victoria, the State Revenue Office is less helpful and its 21 page "Guide to Spouse/Domestic Partner Property Transfers in Duties Online", which you can download from the SRO website, says nothing about using part of a home for business purposes.
The SRO’s client adviser (on 13 21 61) didn’t know the answer and its technical branch believed that as long as you meet all other requirements and the house is now wholly used as a principal residence, nothing in the law would reduce the exemption.
Assuming you obtain an exemption, go to the website, propertyandlandtitles.vic.gov.au and look for "Transfer of Land Forms" to download the "Guide: Transferring property between spouses or domestic partners".
It will give you the option for a non-monetary transfer under the quaint title "Natural love and affection".
Having gone through all that, it is a grey area whether you will save on CGT when you sell.
If you bought your home after 1985 and started using part of it to produce income for the first time after August 20, 1996, you are assumed to have bought the dwelling at its market value at the time.
However, CGT will not apply if the business was run through a company or trust. Also, you may be able to apply one or more of the small business CGT concessions to reduce your capital gain.
It's best to talk to a tax accountant, or seek a private ruling.
Regarding your recent comments on the Australian Taxation Office's treatment of foreign pensions, our tax accountant in WA was apparently not aware of the deductible amount you mentioned in your answer. My wife and I have both been receiving defined-benefit pensions for a number of years from our Canadian employers and also from the Canadian Pension Plan. We are citizens of both Australia and Canada, are non-tax residents in Australia and spend more than half the year in Canada. We may follow our children back to Australia in future. Would the deductible amount from the Canadian defined-benefit pensions be tax exempt? P.C.
As long as you are a non-tax resident, your Canadian pension is not taxable here.
Once you live here for 183-days of a financial year, whether continuously or with breaks, you would be considered a tax resident and your foreign pensions would be taxable.
Where tax is withheld in Canada, you can claim a foreign income tax offset, unless you are entitled to seek a refund there.
Your personal after-tax contributions to the pension fund form the Undeducted Purchase Price (UPP). That part of your annual pension, which represents a return to you of your UPP, known as the deductible amount, is untaxed and is calculated by dividing the UPP by your life expectancy factor at the start of the pension.
Should you move back to the much warmer Land of Oz, and want to claim a deductible amount, Google "ATO Request for a determination of the deductible amount of UPP of a foreign pension or annuity".

    <h5 class="mb-1">ICICI Lombard Q4 net rises 24% to ₹282 cr</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company on Saturday reported a 23.8% rise in net profit at Rs 282 crore for the March quarter.
The non-life insurer had posted a net profit of ₹228 crore in the corresponding period of 2018-19.
The gross direct premium income (GDPI) of the company stood at ₹3,181 crore in Q4 FY20, compared to ₹3,485 crore in Q4 FY19, ICICI Lombard said in a regulatory filing.
For the full year 2019-20, the profit after tax or net profit increased 13.8 per cent to ₹1,194 crore from Rs 1,049 crore in the preceding fiscal.
GDPI of the company stood at ₹13,313 crore in FY20 compared to ₹14,488 crore in FY19, a de-growth of 8.1 per cent, it said.
Excluding crop segment, GDPI increased to ₹13,302 crore during the year compared to ₹12,036 crore in FY19, up 10.5 per cent.
This was in line with the industry growth (excluding crop segment), ICICI Lombard added.

Combined ratio — a measure of profitability — stood at 100.4 per cent in 2019-20 compared to 98.8 per cent a year ago, primarily on account of long-term motor policies, change in product-mix and losses from catastrophic events, the company said.
For the March quarter, the combined ratio stood at 100.1 per cent compared to 99 per cent in the same period last year.
The ratio denotes the money flowing out via in dividends, expenses, and losses. Whereas a ratio below 100 indicates underwriting profit, above 100 means paying out more money in claims than receiving through premium.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to brand cultural products in overseas markets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Researchers from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics and the University of Arizona published a new paper in the Journal of Marketing that examines brand name strategies when cultural products are marketed in foreign countries.
The study forthcoming in the Journal of Marketing titled "Branding Cultural Products in International Markets: A Study of Hollywood Movies in China" is authored by Weihe Gao, Li Ji, Yong Liu, and Qi Sun.
Cultural products such as movies and novels often have immediate brand name recognition in their home countries. But in foreign markets, consumers are accustomed to titles translated into the local language. In an era of globalization, the trend is to stay as much as possible to the original brand name, particularly for well-branded products (e.g., Batman and Superman movies). However, there is often a need to reframe brand names of cultural products that may be culturally distant to foreign consumers. For example, the animated comedy movie Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was translated to It's Raining Falafel in Israel because meatballs are not something Israelis relate to, whereas falafel is a better equivalent to a local food staple.
By incorporating the unique characteristics of these cultural products, the research team develops a theoretical framework that integrates similarity, which focuses on how the translated brand name relates to the original brand name, and informativeness, which focuses on how the translated brand name reveals product content, to study the impact of brand name translations.
The movie market is the research context, specifically Hollywood movies shown in China from 2011 to 2018. The researchers show that higher similarity leads to higher Chinese box office revenue and this effect is stronger for movies that perform better in the home market. When the translated title is more informative about the movie, the Chinese box office revenue increases. The informativeness effect is stronger for Hollywood movies that have a greater cultural gap in the Chinese market. Moreover, both similarity and informativeness effects are strongest at the time the movie is released and reduce over time.
The study provides several valuable managerial implications for cultural product industries. First, the results point out that brand name translation is not a trivial task. How the brand name is translated can have important consequences on product sales. Two different strategies are described: 1) Make translated brand names resemble the original brand names; or 2) Make translated brand names informative of product content. While each can be managed to influence the sales in international markets, there is also a synergy between them—one strategy becomes more effective if the other strategy is also implemented. However, there are situations where achieving both goals in one brand name is difficult because it may require different brand name features and translation techniques. Therefore, companies need to make trade-offs between similarity and informativeness.
This trade-off leads to the second managerial implication. If the product has high home market performance but a small cultural gap, the translation should focus on brand name similarity. If the product has low home market performance but a large cultural gap, the translation should focus on informativeness. If the product has both high home market performance and large cultural gap, both similarity and informativeness will be highly effective in generating sales. Thus, the company should pay attention to both similarity and informativeness, with the relative emphasis between the two decided based on the effect size and the feasibility of each strategy. Finally, if the product has low home market performance and small cultural gap, both strategies will still be helpful, but will not be highly effective.
Third, results indicate that these branding strategies are most effective for product sales in the early period after introduction. This is particularly important for managers given the short life cycle of cultural products. It is critical for companies to be sensitive to brand name translation early and to make sure either similarity or informativeness, or both, are in place before introduction to help increase sales quickly.
Finally, related to the trade-off between similarity and informativeness, companies can follow this analysis to estimate the effect size of the moderating factors. Managers can then more precisely evaluate to what extent product sales will benefit from either strategy so that a sensible trade-off can be made.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to brand cultural products in overseas markets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Researchers from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics and the University of Arizona published a new paper in the Journal of Marketing that examines brand name strategies when cultural products are marketed in foreign countries.
The study forthcoming in the Journal of Marketing titled "Branding Cultural Products in International Markets: A Study of Hollywood Movies in China" is authored by Weihe Gao, Li Ji, Yong Liu, and Qi Sun.
Cultural products such as movies and novels often have immediate brand name recognition in their home countries. But in foreign markets, consumers are accustomed to titles translated into the local language. In an era of globalization, the trend is to stay as much as possible to the original brand name, particularly for well-branded products (e.g., Batman and Superman movies). However, there is often a need to reframe brand names of cultural products that may be culturally distant to foreign consumers. For example, the animated comedy movie Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was translated to It's Raining Falafel in Israel because meatballs are not something Israelis relate to, whereas falafel is a better equivalent to a local food staple.
By incorporating the unique characteristics of these cultural products, the research team develops a theoretical framework that integrates similarity, which focuses on how the translated brand name relates to the original brand name, and informativeness, which focuses on how the translated brand name reveals product content, to study the impact of brand name translations.
The movie market is the research context, specifically Hollywood movies shown in China from 2011 to 2018. The researchers show that higher similarity leads to higher Chinese box office revenue and this effect is stronger for movies that perform better in the home market. When the translated title is more informative about the movie, the Chinese box office revenue increases. The informativeness effect is stronger for Hollywood movies that have a greater cultural gap in the Chinese market. Moreover, both similarity and informativeness effects are strongest at the time the movie is released and reduce over time.
The study provides several valuable managerial implications for cultural product industries. First, the results point out that brand name translation is not a trivial task. How the brand name is translated can have important consequences on product sales. Two different strategies are described: 1) Make translated brand names resemble the original brand names; or 2) Make translated brand names informative of product content. While each can be managed to influence the sales in international markets, there is also a synergy between them--one strategy becomes more effective if the other strategy is also implemented. However, there are situations where achieving both goals in one brand name is difficult because it may require different brand name features and translation techniques. Therefore, companies need to make trade-offs between similarity and informativeness.
This trade-off leads to the second managerial implication. If the product has high home market performance but a small cultural gap, the translation should focus on brand name similarity. If the product has low home market performance but a large cultural gap, the translation should focus on informativeness. If the product has both high home market performance and large cultural gap, both similarity and informativeness will be highly effective in generating sales. Thus, the company should pay attention to both similarity and informativeness, with the relative emphasis between the two decided based on the effect size and the feasibility of each strategy. Finally, if the product has low home market performance and small cultural gap, both strategies will still be helpful, but will not be highly effective.
Third, results indicate that these branding strategies are most effective for product sales in the early period after introduction. This is particularly important for managers given the short life cycle of cultural products. It is critical for companies to be sensitive to brand name translation early and to make sure either similarity or informativeness, or both, are in place before introduction to help increase sales quickly.
Finally, related to the trade-off between similarity and informativeness, companies can follow this analysis to estimate the effect size of the moderating factors. Managers can then more precisely evaluate to what extent product sales will benefit from either strategy so that a sensible trade-off can be made.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM-led meet dwells on crop biotech, format for capital infusion in farming</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today, the government deliberated on the possibility of a uniform statutory framework in the country for infusing capital and technology in the agriculture sector through newer ways.
It also discussed pros and cons of biotechnology in the crop sector, along with fast-tracking reforms in agriculture marketing, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
Developing the Electronic-National Agriculture Market (e-NaM) platform into a ‘platform of platforms’ for e-commerce trade was discussed in the meeting as well.
Yesterday, the government added 200 new mandis to the e-NaM platform taking the total to 785.
The meeting is part of the series of such deliberations that Prime Minister Modi is having on various sector in the aftermath of Covid-19 crisis. Sources said in today's meeting apart from the Prime Minister and PMO bureaucrats, Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also participated. Both the Home Minister and Finance Minister have been part of earlier deliberations on other sectors as well.

Officials in the know said that these sectoral meetings are doubling up as forums to discuss relief measures for various sectors and stakeholders.
There will be some more sectoral meetings on Sunday as well.
“There are no separate meetings to discuss the package. The needs of various sectors, small and medium enterprises, farmers, workers and others are being discussed in the relevant sectoral meetings. These discussions will find their way to any package that is announced,” said an official.
Meanwhile, according to the statement, Prime Minister Modi in today's meeting on agriculture stressed on the need for management of marketable surplus, access of farmers to institutional credit.
He also underlined the need for freeing agriculture sector of various restrictions with appropriate backing of statute.
The focus of the deliberations was also on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco-system and bringing appropriate reforms.
Issues related to cheap credit to agriculture infrastructure, special drives to saturate Kisan Credit Card penetration and PM-KISAN beneficiaries along with facilitating inter-state and intra-state trade in agriculture produce to ensure fairest return to farmer were some of the important areas covered.
Agriculture accounts for 15 per cent of India's gross domestic product and is a source of livelihood for more than half of the country's 1.3 billion population.
The government has maintained that the country's farm sector is functioning smoothly despite the Covid-19 lockdown and there will not be much impact on its growth in the current fiscal, unlike other sectors.

The challenges of the Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016 and how to protect the interest of small and marginal farmers was discussed in detail.
Ways to make the Essential Commodities Act compatible with present times so that large-scale private investment in post-production agriculture infrastructure is incentivized, and how it has a positive effect on commodity derivative markets, was also discussed.
Developing ‘Brand India', creation of commodity specific boards/councils and promotion of agri-clusters or contract farming are some of the interventions that were deliberated to boost agriculture commodity export.
The use of technology in the agriculture sector is of paramount importance as it has the potential to unlock the entire value chain for the benefit of farmers.
Modi emphasised on the dissemination of technology till the last mile and making farmers more competitive in the global value chain.
It was decided to further strengthen the role of Farmers Producer Organisations (FPOs) to bring vibrancy in agrarian economy, transparency in agriculture trade and enable maximum benefits to the farmers.
Overall emphasis was on revisiting the existing laws governing market for better price realisation and freedom of choice to the farmers, the statement said. The growth rate of agriculture and allied sector's growth stood at 3.7 per cent during the 2019-20 fiscal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In PM’s push for farm reforms, a role for Kisan credit cards, PM-KISAN scheme</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held a meeting with ministers and government officials to discuss ways to boost the agriculture sector in India as the country looks to rebound from the economic setback dealt by coronavirus outbreak.
The government’s focus is on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco-system for the farm sector and bringing appropriate reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development.
A government release said that this would be achieved by further strengthening Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and by developing ‘Brand India’ in the sector that would contribute to boosting agricultural exports.
“PM Narendra Modi holds a meeting to discuss ways to boost the agriculture sector; emphasises on the dissemination of technology till the last mile and making farmers more competitive in the global value chain,” said a release by the government.
The prime minister has been stressing on boosting exports to aid economic growth.
The meeting also discussed ways to make several government instruments for the sector including the Kisan Credit Cards, PM-KISAN and e-Nam even more effective and increase their contribution to farmer welfare.
Kisan Credit Cards offer short-term credit limits for crops and term loans to holders by participating banks including cooperatives. This initiative grants farmers access to formal banking networks. KCC credit cardholders are also eligible for personal accident insurance for death and permanent disability.
Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) is a scheme started by the Narendra Modi government in 2018 that provides income support of Rs.6000/- per year to all farmer families across the country. The sum is paid in three equal installments of Rs.2000/- each every four months.
National Agriculture Market or eNAM is another initiative to modernize the farming sector with a tool that helps farmers in discovering the best price for their produce. It (eNAM) is an online trading platform for agricultural commodities that brings farmers, traders and buyers at one place.
Saturday’s meeting, which also discussed ways to invigorate the agriculture sector with modern technology, comes in the backdrop of appeals by the prime minister for self-reliance in a post-coronavirus world and for attracting foreign investments by offering a favourable environment aided by government policy, infrastructural and technological advancement.
India readies to enter the third phase of nationwide lockdown from May 4, which will see a graded resumption of economic activities across the country. The government has given total exemptions to the agriculture sector in all zones.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Holiday Guru is always on call to answer your questions.
This week coronavirus-related queries include British Airways' rebooking policy, claiming money back on travel insurance and rights surrounding a 'non-refundable' deposit on a holiday lodge in Scotland. 
Q. We have paid for a trip to Kenya in July, booking hotels and British Airways flights separately. The hotel says we can go in 2021 instead. Can we change flights?
Karen Grace, via email.
A. BA is offering customers online vouchers for flights before July 31. You may then rebook up to 355 days in advance for up to two years. For a refund, wait until your flight is cancelled, then call 0800 727 800.
Q. Is it legal for a travel firm to say in its terms and conditions that it will not abide by the Package Travel Regulations during a ‘force majeure’?
Andy Brockhurst, via email.
A. The Package Travel Regulations (PTRs) still legally apply, says the consumer group Which? So refunds should be made within 14 days of a cancellation.
Q. I cannot get a refund for my cancelled Ryanair flight. Any advice?
Tracey Snell, via email.
A. Ryanair says customers ‘will be refunded once this crisis is over’, despite EU law stating customers are entitled to refunds within seven days. Either wait, or accept a voucher (if you use Ryanair often).
Q. I paid a £100 ‘non-refundable’ deposit on a holiday lodge in Scotland. Can I now get this back?
Lorraine Hastie, via email.
A. Yes. The Consumer Contracts Regulations (2013) say you are due a refund within 14 days.
Q. What about my travel insurance — can I get money back?
Barbara Unsworth, via email.
A. Yes you should be able to get a refund, provided the insurance was bought before travel restrictions came into effect.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Agricultural Bank of China, one of the country's big four state-owned banks, has tested the digital currency in four cities in an app launched last Wednesday
China's central bank has started testing its official digital currency, pressing ahead with its plan to roll out a virtual money payment system, days after Facebook-backed Libra scaled back its ambitions to become a global currency.
The Digital Currency Research Institute of the People's Bank of China (PBC), China's central bank, said that the research and development work of China's official digital currency, dubbed as DC/EP, is proceeding steadily, and the internal pilot tests are carried out in four cities. The tests will be conducted in scenarios of the 2022 Winter Olympics Games in Beijing.
China's official digital currency is undergoing testing and has not been officially released, state media reported. Insiders said the trial run will be piloted within a small range of banks and end users, and spread to a wider range with an improved technology and system, the Global Times reported.
More banks will continue to participate in the test of the DC/EP, in a bid to improve the technology, security and stability of the payment tool, Chen Bo, director of the Finance Research Centre at the Institute of Finance and Economics at the Central University of Finance and Economics told the daily.
The Agricultural Bank of China, one of the country's big four state-owned banks, has tested the DC/EP (digital currency/electronic payment) in four cities in an app launched last Wednesday. "There will be two types of players in future trials, the banks and telecom companies. At present, the central bank is testing the software of DC/EP, and whether it will be combined with 5G and sim cards in the future needs to be discussed," Chen said.
He noted that in the future, there may be two forms of digital currency payments - one is to be applied in an application, and the other is to bind with the sim card. According to a research note by Citic Securities, China is expected to officially make the sovereign digital currency available to the public later this year.
The brokerage house added the total size of China's digital currency could reach one trillion yuan ($140 billion), equivalent to about one-eighth of China's cash, the South China Morning Post reported. In comparison, the total market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, is about $200 bn.

    <h5 class="mb-1">China’s Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency enters race days after Facebook’s Libra fails to fly</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">China’s central bank has started testing its official Bitcoin-like digital currency DCEP, and the bank is now planning to roll out the virtual money payment system soon. Days after Facebook-backed Libra scaled down its ambitions to become a global currency, China is now inching ahead in the race. Digital Currency Research Institute of the People’s Bank of China (PBC) said that the research and development work of China’s official digital currency DCEP is proceeding steadily, PTI reported. China is currently carrying out internal pilot tests for the cryptocurrency in four cities. However, the cryptocurrency has not been officially launched yet, state media reported.
Trial runs for DCEP will be piloted in a small range of banks and end users. After that, it will be spread to a wider range with certain improvement in technology and system, the Global Times reported. Later, more banks are also likely to participate in the test of the DCEP to improve overall technology, security and stability of the payment tool, Chen Bo, director of the Finance Research Centre at the Institute of Finance and Economics at the Central University of Finance and Economics told the daily.
“There will be two types of players in future trials, the banks and telecom companies. At present, the central bank is testing the software of DCEP, and whether it will be combined with 5G and sim cards in the future needs to be discussed,” Chen said.
Earlier, US-based social media website Facebook had also announced its plans to launch its in-house cryptocurrency called Libra with launch expected in 2020. However, the currency met with a lukewarm response in the home market with US regulators and politicians expressing concerns about the currency. India too had expressed reservations about cryptocurrencies in general.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Air New Zealand Signs Government Deal To Take Cargo To The World</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Air New Zealand Cargo is entering a partnership with the Government to ensure critical cargo transport lines are maintained.
The International Airfreight Capacity agreement with the Ministry of Transport will allow exporters and importers the ability to access key markets in a world where available air freight capacity is reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Air New Zealand General Manager Cargo Rick Nelson says cargo customers will be able to access capacity across Air New Zealand’s traditional network, with a handful of exceptions.
“The new agreement means Air New Zealand can publish scheduled cargo services into key markets which will allow freight forwarders, exporters and importers to plan and operate their logistics supply chains with certainty.
“We are working to offer connectivity to and from the United Kingdom and Europe, as well as Houston and Chicago via Los Angeles and San Francisco, Hong Kong and Narita gateways.
“This agreement will add significant value to New Zealand’s air cargo community, and we encourage the New Zealand forwarding, export and import communities to get behind these cargo options. Naturally, we hope the need to operate under an agreement of this nature will be a short-term business model and in time we’ll be able to revert to our traditional model as demand for passenger travel begins to pick up.”
Ports the airline will not operate cargo flights to under the agreement are London and Buenos Aires. Singapore is also not included in the initial phase.

    <h5 class="mb-1">International cargo flights ramp up - Twyford</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Government support to help restore international air freight capacity has added 56 weekly cargo flights from New Zealand, with more to come, Transport Minister Phil Twyford announced today.
The International Air Freight Capacity scheme adds capacity for high-value export cargo and maintains trade links with key global markets. It also ensures there are essential imports such as medical supplies.
Phil Twyford says it is vital air freight capacity recovers as New Zealand responds to the COVID-19 global pandemic.
"At the beginning of the pandemic, we moved quickly to support charter flights to ensure New Zealand had the crucial supplies it needs and to back our exporters. However, these flights only allowed businesses to export to a limited number of markets.
"This scheme builds on that support, with a schedule of weekly flights to a greater number of global markets. This new schedule restores more export markets to more businesses and with greater frequency.
"There is a huge demand for air freight, at a time when capacity is limited. This scheme helps provide certainty for business, while airlines and carriers respond to a changing world.
"The $330 million scheme is short-term and market-led. Funding is provided to guarantee cargo on key routes under agreements with the carriers. Carriers then offer that capacity directly to freight customers on commercial terms.
"We invited commercial proposals to deliver air freight capacity with key markets. The first successful applicants are Air New Zealand, China Airlines, Emirates, Freightways Express, Qantas and Tasman Cargo. We are working with other carriers, and expect to make further announcements shortly.
"We are closely monitoring the international air freight market, and will respond based on how the COVID-19 situation evolves. As the market recovers, we will reassess the need for funding.
"The Government set aside $600 million for the aviation sector as part of its $12.1 billion COVID-19 support package. Acknowledging the impacts of the pandemic on the domestic aviation sector, the Government has also provided immediate funding for local air freight and lifeline air services.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Refunds save the day for April direct tax collection; mop-up down 5%</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Direct tax collection surged 36.5 per cent to Rs 34,784 crore in the first month of fiscal year 2020-21, despite a nationwide lockdown, thanks to a 63 per cent year-on-year (YoY) fall in tax refunds in April.
Without accounting for refunds, the collection contracted 5.4 per cent, indicating muted economic activity as the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent curbs paralysed most sectors.
Gross direct tax collection stood at Rs 41,556 crore in April, as against Rs 43,950 crore in the corresponding period last year. Refunds of Rs 6,772 crore were about a third of the amount disbursed in the same month last year, at Rs 18,474 crore, which boosted net collection. Incidentally, the government last month announced expediting refunds up to Rs 5 lakh to improve cash flows for individuals and small and medium enterprises amid coronavirus-related disruptions in the economy.
“A sharp fall in refund disbursement can be credited for the high double-digit net direct tax collection growth seen in April. The gross figure, on the other hand, paints the real picture, where collection has fallen,” said a government official.

Coming months will see net collections under pressure as the base effect will wean off, and economic growth is at a standstill.
A tax official said the lower refunds in April were due to avoidance of ad hoc adjustment, where large corporates paid extra tax in March on the request of tax officers to meet tax targets.These are later adjusted in April by way of refunds or deducted as TDS payments. “This time, due to economic uncertainty and lockdown, there wasn’t much extra tax paid by corporates in March. Therefore, refunds are low,” said another official.
Refunds in the Mumbai zone were 84 per cent lower at Rs 1,600 crore, compared with the Rs 10,000 crore refunds issued in April last year.
Direct tax collection missed the downward revised target for 2019-20 by Rs 1.42 trillion, settling at Rs 10.27 trillion, a 9.5 per cent fall over the previous year. A growth rate of 28.2 per cent will be needed as against the assumed rate of 12 per cent in the Budget to meet the collection target of Rs 13.19 trillion.

With earnings of a majority of companies hit due to the Covid-19 lockdown, the February revenue collection target announced in the Budget no longer holds. Hence, income tax officers have urged for a revision in the Budget estimates.
FY21 revenue projections were based on an assumed nominal GDP growth of 10 per cent, which means a tax buoyancy of 1.2. The Economic Survey had pegged FY21 real GDP growth at 6-6.5 per cent, which is far from realistic now.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cut India’s growth forecast for FY21 in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) report to 1.9 per cent from 5.8 per cent projected in January.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bucking the lockdown trend, the Centre’s net direct tax collections soared to ₹34,783 crore in April this year. This is a 36.5 per cent jump from the net direct tax mop-up, which stood at ₹25,477 crore.
While gross direct tax collections fell marginally in April, a reason for this spurt in net collections is lower refunds.
According to sources, about ₹6,772 crore of income tax refunds were issued in April this year as against ₹18,473 crore in April 2019.
Meanwhile, gross direct tax collections declined by 5.4 per cent in April 2020 to ₹41,555 crore as compared to ₹43,950 crore in April last year.
The direct tax mop-up could give some reprieve to the Exchequer, which is already faced with slowing goods and services tax collection amid the national lockdown to prevent the rapid spread of Covid-19.
The Centre has deferred the release of revenue data from GST for April.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Top Wall Street Analysts See Bitcoin Hitting $15,000 in Next 12 Months</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The price action over the past few days has undoubtedly been positive for Bitcoin. Case in point: the cryptocurrency ripped over 20% higher from the mid-$7,000s to a price as high as $9,500 over the course of 48 hours.
Prices have since consolidated at $8,800, with BTC finding itself stuck between support around $8,500 and resistance at the ever-important level of $9,000.
While some have said that this price action is indicative of Bitcoin forming a topping pattern, a leading analysis firm on Wall Street has suggested that the recent surge is just the beginning of a bigger crypto market rally.
In a research note on cryptocurrency published Thursday, David Grider — the lead digital strategist at Wall Street analysis firm Fundstrat Global Advisors — said that his firm is bullish on Bitcoin moving forward, specifically citing the halving as a positive catalyst:
Marketwatch, which covered the note, suggested that Fundstrat sees the cryptocurrency nearly doubling in the coming 12 months to $14,350.
Fundstrat co-founder Thomas Lee shared the positive sentiment on Twitter, explaining that Bitcoin’s year-to-date performance proves that it is not only benefiting from the halving, but is also acting as a “solid risk-on asset and as a hedge against calamity.” 
Adding to the fundamental confluence that Fundstrat’s analysts laid out, there are other signs, technical analysis signals, that Bitcoin is preparing to enter a bull phase.
Per previous reports from Bitcoinist, a trader noted that BTC’s strong rebound from the start to the end of April allowed the cryptocurrency’s monthly candle to close above a key level of the Ichimoku Cloud on the one-month chart.
This is relevant for BTC because the last time Bitcoin claimed this technical level was near the start of 2016, when the cryptocurrency was trading around $500. What followed was a nearly 4,000% rally that brought the cryptocurrency to $20,000 just 20 months later.
Chart from @TraderSmokey (Twitter)
Adding to this, the cryptocurrency recently accomplished a strong technical feat: it managed to surmount $6,400 without much resistance, then claim the level as support by bouncing off it.
This is important because $6,400 has been key to BTC for the past 18 months, acting as a turning point for this market on many occasions. Bitcoin recapturing this level gives credence to the idea that the cryptocurrency is entering into a medium-term bull trend.

    <h5 class="mb-1">There’s a $8 Million Bitcoin Sell Wall That Will Haunt Any Near-Term Uptrend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The price action over the past few days has undoubtedly been positive for Bitcoin. Case in point: the cryptocurrency ripped over 20% higher from the mid-$7,000s to a price as high as $9,500 over the course of 48 hours.
Prices have since consolidated at $8,800, with BTC finding itself stuck between support around $8,500 and resistance at the ever-important level of $9,000.
The consolidation, unfortunately, could result in a further sell-off as an analyst has noted that a large Bitcoin sell wall has formed on Binance.
Although Bitcoin has been making attempts at rallying higher over the past few hours as of this article’s writing, a top analyst observed that a sell wall consisting of 1,000 Bitcoin — worth over $8 million — has just recently appeared on Binance.
Should BTC fail to catch a bid during any attempt at rallying in the coming hours, it could be strongly rejected by the Binance sell wall, which will act as resistance for the cryptocurrency market as long as it is on the order book.
Adding to the threat the sell wall poses to Bitcoin in the near term, Bloomberg also recently observed that the cryptocurrency recently became technically overbought “based on the GTI Global Strength Indicator,” with the momentum oscillator recently crossing above 70.
This confluence corroborates an analysis by a top crypto trader, who identified that Bitcoin is likely to correct towards the low-$8,000s due to the rejection at a key Fibonacci Retracement level. He wrote:
Despite the risk of a short-term correction, there is a growing number of prominent investors and traders that believe the crypto market’s medium-term trajectory remains bullish.
Kelvin Koh — a former Goldman Sachs partner and current partner at The Spartan Group — recently wrote in an analysis that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak is decisively bullish for Bitcoin and other digital assets.
Central banks injecting trillions of dollars worth of stimulus into all facets of the economy while BTC will see its block reward halving, Koh explained, are trends with “uncanny timing[s]” that “dramatically increase the odds that we get another exponential price spike for Bitcoin with spillover effects to other crypto assets.”
In terms of on-chain metrics, data companies in the industry like Glassnode and Coin Metrics have observed that the number of individuals using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is on the rise, only corroborating the idea that a bull rally is brewing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why using all your credit cards now will protect your finances</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unusual times call for unusual advice, which is why I’m now saying something I never expected to while doing my job:
Go out and use all of your credit cards.
Before you start thinking I’ve lost my mind after weeks of social distancing alone in my work cave, let me explain that the advice has nothing to do with racking up debt and everything to do with protecting your available credit and credit score.
Credit advice right now is anything but standard; here are four protective steps that every consumer — but especially those fearing and/or facing potential financial hardships — should be taking now.
   1. Use all of your credit cards, especially the ones you normally don’t.
When times get tough, lenders go turtle. Banks and credit-card issuers aren’t taking all new credit offers off the table, but they are cleaning up their books.
“Historically, the first cards banks cut are the ones that are rarely if ever used, just because they’re not making any money off of them,” explains Matt Schulz, chief industry analyst at CompareCards.com. “So if you keep a card for traveling, for emergencies, as a back-up and you haven’t used those cards in a while, using those dormant cards now is a good idea.
Advertising
“Don’t spend more money, just shift some purchases around over a couple of cards instead of focusing on one,” he adds. “You can put the expense on and then pay it off right away, but showing that you still use the card is a good idea.”
In the standard credit-card agreement, issuers must give a six-week notice before changing interest rates, but typically they can reduce your credit limit or shut down a card that hasn’t been used without prior warning.
If your credit limits are cut or eliminated and total available credit is reduced, that changes your “credit utilization,” the second biggest factor in calculating credit scores. It’s the percentage of credit you have access to that you are actually using, and lenders generally want to see it below 30 percent.
Comparecards.com research shows that the average American household had roughly $6,800 in credit-card debt entering the coronavirus pandemic, with about $26,500 in available credit, making for a credit-utilization rate of roughly 25 percent.
Squeeze that average consumer’s available credit by eliminating just $5,000 from limits or in unused cards and the utilization rate goes past the 30 percent threshold, gouging the consumer’s credit score and reducing credit options.
Since active card use makes you a more-attractive customer, get the cards you use for emergencies, travel, back-up and such out of the mothballs.
Advertising
“If you might need the credit, make sure you still have access to it,” says Ted Rossman of CreditCards.com. “Spread your purchases around on your cards right now; issuers want to see that you’re using them, it’s important right now.”
   2. Check your credit report.
The Big Three credit bureaus – Equifax, Experian and TransUnion – are offering consumers free weekly credit reports through April 2021 as a protection from financial hardship created by the coronavirus.
Access the free reports at annualcreditreport.com.
There’s no reason to check weekly, but monthly – especially if you’re asking card issuers and lenders for forbearance – makes sense.
“If you need financial help and call lenders to ask for payment relief or to ask if they will stop the interest clock, be sure to ask if their assistance will show up on your credit report,” says Gerri Detweiler, education director for Nav.com “Don’t assume they’re giving you both payment and credit relief – even though most are — because if they let you skip payments but report anything to the credit bureaus, it could hurt your credit score.
“Even if they tell you they’re doing the right thing, check your credit report to make sure,” she adds.
Review your credit report looking for inaccuracy, mistakes and areas you can improve.
Make sure your name and all addresses are correct; a wrong address – where you never lived – or misspelled name could be a sign of fraud. Be sure you recognize all accounts; if you don’t know why a lender is listed on your credit report, that’s a warning sign.
Examine payment history, especially with any lenders who give you forbearance or deferred-payment plans.
Pursue corrections for anything you even think is wrong; when in doubt, challenge the item and let the lender prove to the credit bureau that the problem is real. If they fail to step up to show that the details are right, they red mark will be removed from your report.
   3. Boost your credit score in a matter of minutes.
Credit reports are the basis for credit scores; it is more important to know the information that’s used to calculate the score is right than to know your score itself, but most consumers want to know where they stand. Many card issuers and banks offer customers their credit scores for free. It’s never a bad idea to check; any significant, unexpected change should send you back to the credit report to figure out what happened.
Experian Boost is a free service that looks at a consumer’s payment history on bills that are not part of the credit report. It considers your payment history with utilities, cell-phone companies and the alike; good histories earn extra points.
It’s available at Experian.com/boost.
Says Rossman: “It won’t hurt you and if you can take an easy win that’ll boost your credit, now is a good time for it.”
   4. Check on card rewards before you lose them.
While most loyalty programs are extending expiration dates, consumers facing financial distress could lose their rewards by missing a payment or entering a deferment program.
“If you see that falling behind in payments is even possible on a rewards card, use the rewards before that happens,” says Detweiler. “Know if you lose the rewards if your payments are missed or you default; if you don’t know, get something of value for your points before they become one more thing you lose getting through this pandemic.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">PERSONAL FINANCE: Managing your Sacco loan amidst current crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">My Sacco has sent me an email about the loans we are currently servicing. It is a thoughtful email.
They have given us options about what we can do to lighten the monthly burden of repaying these loans. Because, you know, coronavirus, uncertain times etcetera etcetera.
They have put these four options on the table. I have broken each down to understand how it applies to you as a borrower, and what you should be aware of as you consider exercising it.
Remember, all these options are temporary measures in response to the current pandemic. We don’t know how long it will last or how much longer it will take before our financial circumstances settle.
For whichever option you exercise, ask your Sacco if you can still revert to normal loan terms – repayment period of 48 months, 12 per cent interest rate – once the cat has been belled. Also ask how it affects your monthly contributions and annual dividends.
Option #1: Repurchase your loan
What the Sacco is saying here is that, on top of your current loan, you can borrow more money on new terms.
That is, a similar interest rate but for a longer repayment period – you will have a bigger loan, more money at your disposal but you will repay less per month.
You will also service this bigger loan for a much longer period and you will end up paying much more on the interest.
Say you had been regularly servicing your loan prior to the pandemic, and now had Sh500,000 left. You exercise this option and borrow more money, say Sh300,000. Your new loan balance is now Sh800,000.
You now have extra money to sort out any other financial emergencies that may have – or will – come up. Say rent, car or medical insurance, illness, employee salaries and whatnot.
Option #2: Consolidate all your loans
Here, the Sacco is offering to buy all the loans you have with other financial institutions and consolidate them into one huge Sacco loan.
That is your bank loan, your loan with another Sacco, your mobile-lending app loan and, if you try your luck, your shylock loan.
Again, we will assume you had a loan balance of Sh500,000. Your other loans are totalling to Sh100,000, this is the extra you borrow from your Sacco.
They will use this money to buy off your all these other loans. They will also extend your repayment period to 60 months.
You now only have the Sacco to deal with. Another plus is that Saccos offer the lowest rate of interest in the market – exercising this option means you will have more money from your income going back into your pocket at every payday.
The catch, again, is the interest you will you will end up paying.
Option #3: Restructure your loan
Restructuring your loan means that the balance you have on your current loan can become a new loan on a new repayment period with a new interest rate.
My Sacco gave this new repayment period as 84 months, and an interest rate of 13 per cent.
Exercising this option gives you some breathing room. Watch out for the ballooning interest though.
Option #4: Repayment proposal from you
My Sacco says it is open to engaging with borrowers so they can customise a repayment plan. I believe this is the best option because we are all swimming against these rough seas with different strokes.
Employees in the tourism industry felt the sting from as early as February and by March were either on compulsory unpaid leave or already had pay cut.
Industries such as media will begin to feel the pinch in May. Those in the telecomm industry may not feel the pinch at all.
You can flex your interest rate (to 12, 13 or 14 per cent) and your repayment period (to a maximum of 84 months) as a mash up of the better features from the other options.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) — Russia slightly increased its crude oil and condensate production in April ahead of the biggest-ever output cuts under the new OPEC+ deal.
The country’s producers pumped 46.45 million tons of oil last month, Interfax reported, citing preliminary data for April from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit. The figure, which may be rounded, equates to about 11.349 million barrels a day on average, based on the standard 7.33 barrels-per-ton conversion ratio. Russia produced 11.298 million barrels a day in March.
That means, that like Saudi Arabia, Russia took the option of pumping more crude last month after the collapse of the previous pact between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, but the increase in output was much smaller. Saudi Arabia’s move to hike production, to an unprecedented 12 million barrels a day in early April, coincided with nationwide lockdowns amid the coronavirus outbreak and exacerbated a global oil glut.
Last month, OPEC+, spearheaded by de facto leader Saudi Arabia, agreed to joint output cuts across the group of 9.7 million barrels a day in May.
Saudi Aramco has already begun reducing oil production, ahead of the May 1 start, to achieve the agreed level of 8.5 million barrels a day, according to a Saudi industry official familiar with the matter.
Russia’s share of the cuts, which is equal to Saudi Arabia’s, is set to reach 2.5 million barrels a day of crude — condensate is excluded — in May and June. Constraints in output will be divided between all Russian producers, including small oil companies and operators of product-sharing agreements, proportionally to their share in nation’s total output, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in an interview with Interfax news agency earlier this week.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russian oil output jumped to 11.35 million bpd in April, ahead of cuts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Vladimir Soldatkin
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia raised oil and gas condensate output in April to 46.45 million tonnes, or 11.35 million barrels per day (bpd), from 11.29 million bpd in March, Interfax reported on Saturday, before it makes cuts this month under a global supply pact.
The report, which cited Energy Ministry data, showed April's figure was the highest monthly average output since January 2019, when it was 11.38 million bpd.
Reuters uses the barrels/tonnes ratio of 7.33.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other allied producers, a group known as OPEC+, agreed last month to cut their combined oil output by about almost 10 million bpd, or 10% of global supply in May and June to tackle the economic fallout from the new coronavirus.
The United States, Norway, Canada and Brazil may add cuts that would bring the total reduction to 20 million bpd, or 20% of global supply, although the coronavirus crisis has driven down demand by as much as 30%, driving down prices.
Russia is expected to cut its oil production by 2.5 million bpd from a baseline of 11 million bpd in May and June.
This number exempts production of gas condensate, or light oil. Russian energy ministry does not disclose gas condensate production separately.
TATNEFT'S REDUCTION
Russia's mid-sized oil producer Tatneft (MM:TATN) said on Saturday it produced 1.994 million tonnes of oil in April, down from 2.442 million tonnes in March.
The reduction amounted to around 90,000 bpd, or 16% from March. It did not say why it reduced output last month.
Tatneft cut output because storage capacity is full and European demand is weak, according to sources and data seen by Reuters last week.
The company operates in Tatarstan in central Russia which became the country's main oil province in the 1970s with output of 2 million bpd, helping the Soviet Union fund its arms race with the United States.
Russia has pledged to meet its commitments in full with output projected to fall to between 480 million and 500 million tonnes, or 9.6 million to 10 million bpd, this year, its first annual decline since 2008.
Natural gas production in April reached 55.14 billion cubic metres, a decline of 14.3% from the same month a year earlier, the Interfax news agency also reported.
It also said Russian oil exports increased 2.2% year on year to 83.79 million tonnes in the January-April period.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In order to meet redemption pressure, fund managers are struggling to either sell or pledge top-rated liquid papers to raise money
Market regulator Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has directed mutual funds (MFs) to disclose data of all holdings in unlisted bonds - securities that cannot be traded in a frozen bond market. The move comes a week after one of the country's oldest asset management companies (AMC), Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund, voluntarily decided to close its six debt schemes effective from April 23, 2020. The AMC had cited redemption pressure and lack of liquidity in bond markets for the shutting of schemes.
In order to meet redemption pressure, fund managers are struggling to either sell or pledge top-rated liquid papers to raise money.
Sebi has asked the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) to furnish details - such as the assets under management of schemes holding unlisted non-convertible debentures (NCDs), unlisted bonds these have pumped in money and the share of such bonds in the scheme.
Will RBI's Rs 50,000 crore boost for mutual funds allay investors' fears?
The mutual fund body has also been asked to disclose investment break-up of portfolio of schemes holding unlisted NCDs, according to a report in The Economic Times. Funds have to give the details of residual maturities of all bonds (listed and unlisted) in each such scheme and whether an issuer holds other listed securities such as stocks, bonds, or CPs.
In 2019, Sebi asked MFs to reduce their investment limit in unlisted NCDs to 15% by March 31, 2020, and 10% by June 30, 2020.
However, considering a rise in bond yields, SEBI earlier this week eased the deadline by six months for MFs to comply with the cap on investments in unlisted NCDs. Unlisted NCDs have been facing a shortage of liquidity during the past few months as MFs were not allowed to invest in such securities (as well as unlisted commercial papers) since October 1, 2019.
The worth of unlisted papers in six schemes that were closed by Franklin Templeton was 32% as of April 22, 2020.
"Not all listed bonds are liquid, particularly in the current market. Probably SEBI is trying to assess the risk in the system and stress it could have if redemptions continue," said an industry person. "There are mid-sized companies, including NBFCs, which do not list their NCDs. In unlisted papers, the terms and conditions may not be readily available," said the person.
Sebi had asked  MFs to share details by Friday evening. "It's a bank holiday, exchanges are shut. We were not expecting any email from Sebi asking for data. The regulator has not said why it needs the information," a person with knowledge of the matter said.
Amid coronavirus crisis, funds are facing redemption pressure which is denoted by a rise in bond yields.
Many funds have sought a month-long loan line from banks - in place of the intra-day overdrafts they use in normal situations to meet the temporary cash-flow mismatch.
BT Insight: Where 6 Franklin Templeton funds got stuck; recovery tougher
On April 30, RBI decided to extend the regulatory benefits announced under the Standing Liquidity Facility-Mutual Fund (SLF-MF) scheme to all banks. To claim regulatory benefits, the banks would be required to submit a weekly statement on loans and advances extended to eligible entities.
The decision came merely three days after the RBI on April 27 announced a Rs 50,000 crore special liquidity facility to ease pressure on mutual funds, which are facing liquidity crisis amid heightened volatility in capital markets in reaction to COVID-19 outbreak.
This liquidity facility is available till May 11, 2020, or up to utilisation of the allocated amount, whichever is earlier. "When a scheme borrows, the interest cost to the extent of average portfolio yield is borne by the scheme. Most borrowings are at higher than portfolio yields and the spillover is borne by the AMC," a fund manager told ET.
MF schemes are allowed to borrow up to 20% of the assets under management.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sebi asks funds to give info on holdings in all unlisted bonds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mumbai: The Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked mutual funds (MFs) to share information of all holdings in unlisted bonds — securities which have become untradeable in a frozen bond market where fund managers, grappling with redemption pressure, are struggling to either sell or pledge top-rated liquid papers to raise money.
The capital market regulator has asked the fund industry body to give details — such as the assets under management of schemes holding unlisted non-convertible debentures (NCDs), the various unlisted bonds these have invested in, and the share of such bonds in the scheme.
Last year, MFs were told to lower their investment limit in unlisted NCDs to 15% by March 31, 2020 and 10% by June 30, 2020. However, faced with a risk-averse market and surging bond yields, Sebi, earlier this week, extended the deadline by six months for MFs to comply with the cap on investments in unlisted NCDs. The liquidity in unlisted NCDs have come down over the past few months as MFs were restricted from investing in such securities (as well as unlisted commercial papers) since October 1, 2019.
The value of unlisted papers in the six schemes that were recently shut down by the top asset manager Franklin Templeton was 32% as on April 22, 2020.
In its communication to the Association of Mutual Funds in India, Sebi has also asked for investment break-up of portfolio of schemes holding unlisted NCDs. For each such scheme, funds have to give the residual maturities of all bonds (listed and unlisted) and whether an issuer has other listed securities like stocks, bonds or CPs.
“Not that all listed bonds are liquid, particularly in the current market. Probably, Sebi is trying to assess the risk in the system and stress it could have if redemptions continue,” said an industry person. “There are mid-sized companies, including NBFCs, which do not list their NCDs. In unlisted papers, the terms and conditions may not be readily available,” said the person.
The fund houses were told to share the data by Friday evening. “It’s a bank holiday, exchanges are shut. We were not expecting any email from Sebi asking for data.The regulator has not said why it needs the information,” said a source.
According to market circles, funds are dealing with redemption and this is reflected in the rise in bond yields. Many funds have approached banks for a month-long loan lines – instead of the intra-day overdrafts they typically draw in normal times to tide of temporary cash-flow mismatch. “When a scheme borrows, the interest cost to the extent of average portfolio yield is borne by the scheme. Most borrowings are at higher than portfolio yields and the spillover is borne by the AMC,” said a fund manager. Rules allow an MF scheme to borrow up to 20% of the assets under management.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leading Indian carmakers had zero sales in April</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mumbai: India’s top carmakers couldn’t ship a single vehicle to dealers in April as they shut production after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the world’s biggest stay-at-home restrictions to stop the coronavirus from spreading.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., which produces about half the cars on India’s roads, and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., the nation’s biggest SUV maker, recorded no sales in the domestic market last month. Hyundai Motors India Ltd. too couldn’t sell a single unit last month. Maruti sold more than 120,000 cars a month in the year ended March 31.
“There’s always a first time for everything,” said Maruti’s Chairman R.C. Bhargava in a phone interview. “I can’t say what will happen in May. Whether we will start production or not is not possible to forecast.”
The total lockdown is hurting local vehicle makers, who sold more than 2.8 million cars, SUVs and vans each month in the year ended March, more than peers in other countries. In China, while sales plunged in February, the peak of the pandemic in that nation, companies managed to sell 224,000 cars. Indian carmakers were struggling even before the lockdown. The pandemic and the ensuing stay-at-home orders on March 25 have since disrupted supply chains.
With the economy set for a rare contraction, the outlook for the car manufacturers remains bleak. They are losing 23 billion rupees ($306 million) each day factories remain closed, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. The lobby group has written to the government seeking help.
“Considering the fragile health of the automotive industry, as also its economic contribution, we are writing to request you to kindly allow the entire automotive value chain for opening up and re-commencing operations,” car and auto part makers said in a joint letter to the Ministry of Home Affairs on Friday.
The ministry extended the stay-at-home restrictions for most parts of the country for two weeks starting May 4.
Bhargava in a recent interview to Bloomberg had said he expects a car-sales boom after the lockdown is lifted as customers appear more motivated to buy than before the pandemic because they see personal vehicles as safer than public transport.
Although there were no sales in the local market last month, Maruti exported 632 units after a port in the western state of Gujarat resumed operations, while Mahindra sold 733 vehicles in international markets. Hyundai shipped 1341 units in April. These are wholesale numbers as Indian carmakers do not announce retail figures.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The charity’s director general Hilary McGrady has said ‘a sharp drop in income’ is threatening the future of nature sites and staff.
The National Trust is set to lose up to £200 million this year due to the coronavirus crisis, the charity says.
The conservation organisation is now appealing to the Government for “urgent, practical” support after they had to halt a number of projects due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
Director general Hilary McGrady has said “a sharp drop in income” is threatening the country’s environmental sector.
Speaking to BBC Breakfast, the charity boss estimated the trust “lost about 50% of our annual income literally overnight” when they closed earlier this year.
Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Ms McGrady urged ministers to step in and “address nature, wildlife and environmental organisations with an immediate offer of support,” given that they had thanked a number of manufacturing businesses.
She also called on Government to be environmentally-minded in its economic recovery plan, and added: “Delivering green infrastructure will create new jobs and makes economic sense and there have been some encouraging signs from Government.
“No doubt some will argue for high-tariff fixes […] in some cases cutting back on environmental checks and spending to deliver these.
“Others will want the Government to dilute its proposed new nature-friendly farming legislation. They must not win.”
The boss of the largest conservation charity in the UK believes “if we sacrifice the environmental progress we have made, everyone will suffer.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Leeroy Jenkins Of Tech Sends Tweet, Wipes $14 Billion Off Tesla's Market Value</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tesla stocks are too damn high, or something like that. At least that’s what Elon Musk said on Twitter earlier today, “Tesla stock price is too high imo.” It appears that, once again, the stock market was listening.
As Ars Technica points out, before Musk sent that tweet, Tesla stock was around $US760 ($1,184) a share, but 20 minutes later it dropped to $US722 ($1,124), or five per cent lower. As of the writing of this article, Tesla stock sits at $US702 ($1,093) a share, or $US80 ($125) less than yesterday’s closing price. At the moment, about $US14 ($22) billion has been wiped from the market value of Tesla.
This isn’t the first time Musk has tweeted something that got him in trouble. In August 2018, he claimed that Tesla had secured funding to take Tesla private at $US420 ($654) per share. But the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against him for that tweet (and others), saying that he violated market-manipulation laws. In the lawsuit, the SEC sought to remove Musk as Tesla’s CEO as well as one of its board members.
The SEC won the case, resulting in Musk and Tesla being ordered to pay $US40 ($62) million in penalties to harmed investors. The settlement included provisions that required him to have Tesla approve any and all of his communications (including Tweets) that could affect stock price before he made them public. However, the SEC made a second filling against Musk in March 2019 for not having any of his tweets officially approved. It seems like Musk would be in the wrong again here, given that Tesla stock prices fell soon after his ‘Tesla stock is too high’ tweet. (Hey, maybe he got that boneheaded tweet approved!) Tesla did not immediately return Gizmodo’s request for comment, we’ll update this post when we receive a reply.
The original filing did not specify a time frame on that provision, only that Musk would be ineligible to be re-elected Chairman for three years, so not until 2021. It’s conceivable that he’ll still need a Twitter babysitter regardless. Or maybe just a babysitter in general. Today, The Wall Street Journal reached out to Musk to ask if he was joking or if he had his tweet vetted. He responded with a short, “No.”
It’s been a crazy week for Musk, to say the least. He went on an earnings call rant, claiming that covid-19 lockdown policies were akin to fascism, tweeted “FREE AMERICA NOW,” and pulled NASA into the mess by dismissing a reporter for asking a covid-19 related question. Oh, and he claims he’s selling almost all of his physical possessions, including his house, to devote himself to Mars and Earth. His GF is mad at him for saying that, but at least Musk made the stipulation that whoever buys his home can’t tear it down since it was once Gene Wilder’s home, and its soul must remain intact.

    <h5 class="mb-1">For Fed Chair Powell, March was pure madness as coronavirus response intensified</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON: A half-hour staff meeting in a secure location.
A 40-minute consultation with an infectious disease specialist.
Multiple days of "unscheduled telephone calls from home with staff and other government officials," including Saturdays and Sundays.
These are just a few of the items on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's March calendar, released on Friday, that chronicle a dramatic shift from warily watching the coronavirus to an all-out effort to bring policymakers, government officials and lawmakers on board for an economic support effort of unprecedented size and scope.
Though the calendar gives no details on what was discussed, it suggests an explosion of activity at the US central bank unseen since the darkest days of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
Powell's sudden ramp-up in activity began on Feb 28, with a flurry of calls to his central banker counterparts at the European Central Bank, among others. Those calls - including a 17-minute one with the head of the central bank in China, where the coronavirus outbreak had begun - continued for another two days as the Fed prepared its first concrete response to the coronavirus crisis: an emergency interest rate cut on Mar 3.
But that was only the beginning of a month packed with an exceptional number of meetings, some of which were quite unusual by the standards of Fed chair calendars, published monthly with a lag of four to six weeks.
Take, for instance, a Friday, March 6, late-afternoon phone call with someone identified only as an "outside expert."
A Fed spokeswoman later said it was a telephone briefing with University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's infectious disease chief, Trish Perl.
Two days later, Powell held an hourlong Sunday morning meeting with fellow central bankers, and a second hourlong call that evening with staff.
The next day he and the staff met for a half hour in a "sensitive compartmented information facility," a secure room usually reserved for classified information.
Fed policymakers met the following Sunday, conferencing by video their far-flung colleagues who participated from Fed regional banks across the country.
They slashed interest rates to zero and launched the first of nearly a dozen lending and other programs designed to keep financial markets from imploding.
They also aimed to cushion the economy from the oncoming shock of mass layoffs and business closures as the country began to shut down to slow the spread of the virus, the extent of which has only lately become clear as states report 30 million people sought unemployment insurance over the past six weeks.
Over the course of March, as cases of the coronavirus mounted and policymakers began to express more public concern, Powell spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at least 11 times, the calendar shows. That is surely an undercount as the two worked out a range of corporate lending programs, some of which had never before been tried, to keep previously healthy businesses afloat.
Mnuchin told CNBC on March 26 that he had been speaking with Powell 30 times a day.
Powell met with two titans of markets: Larry Fink, chief executive of Blackrock and Ron O'Hanley, CEO of State Street. Both firms later were assigned roles helping to administer emergency Fed programs to help financial markets.
And he spoke with several lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who later said he had told her to "think big fiscally."
Congress passed a US$2.3 trillion rescue package in late March that included grants to small business and loans to firms in critical industries, as well as cash payments to American households and for the newly unemployed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">For Fed Chair Powell, March was intense as response to Covid-19 intensified</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A half-hour staff meeting in a secure location.
A 40-minute consultation with an infectious disease specialist.
Multiple days of "unscheduled telephone calls from home with staff and other government officials," including Saturdays and Sundays.
These are just a few of the items on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's March calendar, released on Friday, that chronicle a dramatic shift from warily watching the coronavirus to an all-out effort to bring policymakers, government officials and lawmakers on board for an economic support effort of unprecedented size and scope.
Though the calendar gives no details on what was discussed, it suggests an explosion of activity at the US central bank unseen since the darkest days of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
Powell's sudden ramp-up in activity began on February 28, with a flurry of calls to his central banker counterparts at the European Central Bank, among others. Those calls - including a 17-minute one with the head of the central bank in China, where the coronavirus outbreak had begun - continued for another two days as the Fed prepared its first concrete response to the coronavirus crisis: an emergency interest rate cut on March 3.

But that was only the beginning of a month packed with an exceptional number of meetings, some of which were quite unusual by the standards of Fed chair calendars, published monthly with a lag of four to six weeks.
Take, for instance, a Friday, March 6, late-afternoon phone call with someone identified only as an "outside expert."
A Fed spokeswoman later said it was a telephone briefing with University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's infectious disease chief, Trish Perl.
Two days later, Powell held an hourlong Sunday morning meeting with fellow central bankers, and a second hourlong call that evening with staff.
The next day he and the staff met for a half hour in a "sensitive compartmented information facility," a secure room usually reserved for classified information.
Fed policymakers met the following Sunday, conferencing by video their far-flung colleagues who participated from Fed regional banks across the country.
They slashed interest rates to zero and launched the first of nearly a dozen lending and other programs designed to keep financial markets from imploding.
They also aimed to cushion the economy from the oncoming shock of mass layoffs and business closures as the country began to shut down to slow the spread of the virus, the extent of which has only lately become clear as states report 30 million people sought unemployment insurance over the past six weeks.
Over the course of March, as cases of the coronavirus mounted and policymakers began to express more public concern, Powell spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at least 11 times, the calendar shows. That is surely an undercount as the two worked out a range of corporate lending programs, some of which had never before been tried, to keep previously healthy businesses afloat.
Mnuchin told CNBC on March 26 that he had been speaking with Powell 30 times a day.

Powell met with two titans of markets: Larry Fink, chief executive of Blackrock and Ron O'Hanley, CEO of State Street. Both firms later were assigned roles helping to administer emergency Fed programs to help financial markets.
And he spoke with several lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who later said he had told her to "think big fiscally."
Congress passed a $2.3 trillion rescue package in late March that included grants to small business and loans to firms in critical industries, as well as cash payments to American households and for the newly unemployed.
Powell also spoke once with President Donald Trump on March 23, during which it was reported that Trump, usually a vociferous Powell critic, gave him rare praise.
Powell's calendar also shows how he personally adapted to stay-at-home orders that by the end of the month covered most of the US population.
Powell's last engagement that took place at the Fed's Washington headquarters was the March 15 policy-setting meeting. After that he worked from home every day that month, his calendar shows, including weekends.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Job Opportunities Grow As Primary Sector Exports Show Resilience Through COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MEDIA STATEMENT
Strong international demand for New Zealand’s food, despite the global effects of COVID-19, could help provide a springboard to get more Kiwis into primary sector jobs, Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor said.
“The latest provisional trade statistics show our apples and kiwifruit continue to be star performers, with $890 million of fruit exported between 1 February and 22 April 2020,” Damien O’Connor said.
“Our dairy and meat sectors are also holding their own into April and they shipped products to overseas customers worth $6.18 billion over the same period.
“Overall primary sector export revenue remains higher into April than for the same period in 2018, despite the forestry sector essentially being shut down over the past month. Now we’ve moved into Alert Level 3, industries affected by the lockdown such as forestry and wool are back into action and that will help.
“The strength of New Zealand’s primary sector coupled with the success of our health response to COVID-19 gives us a head-start on the world as we get our economy moving again.
“Our primary sector contributes over $46 billion dollars a year in exports to our economy and provides jobs for hundreds of thousands of people in our rural communities. These latest stats show the sector is in a strong position to help us reboot our economy.
Mr O’Connor said the primary sector will need about 50,000 more people in a post-COVID-19 world.
“There are jobs going all over the country ranging from hands on work in orchards, on farms, in forests and fishing boats, to professional roles in engineering, science and management.
“The Government is working alongside the primary sector to help ensure workers get to the places they are needed. We’re currently investigating further ways we can boost the primary sector workforce through the Government’s $100m redeployment scheme.
“I’ve been impressed by the way the primary sector, government agencies and others have come together to support each other, further reinforcing that our team of 5 million is just as important now as during the lockdown,” Damien O’Connor said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Exxon, Chevron slam brakes on shale as oil demand tumbles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are slamming the brakes on oil output, as the top two U.S. producers plan for combined global shut-ins of 800,000 barrels per day in response to plunging crude prices and fuel demand.
HOUSTON: Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are slamming the brakes on oil output, as the top two U.S. producers plan for combined global shut-ins of 800,000 barrels per day in response to plunging crude prices and fuel demand.
Both companies on Friday outlined deep cuts in investments in the Permian shale basin, the top U.S. oilfield where growth in recent years made America the world's top oil producer and a net exporter for the first time in decades. They each announced global shut-ins of up to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) this quarter due to lockdowns to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
Exxon and Chevron have been sidelining Permian drilling equipment since the market started crashing in March. U.S. crude prices have plunged nearly 70per cent this year to under US$20 a barrel, and traded in negative territory on April 20 for the first time ever.
Oil and gas output at both U.S. producers rose in the first quarter with the companies racing to produce 1 million barrels per day in the Permian. Then fuel demand sank nearly a third due to travel and business lockdowns, while a flood of Russian and Saudi oil hit the market when they abandoned production cuts.
"We would intend to bring activity back to the Permian when we see prices recover," Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said in an interview.
The two oil majors spent heavily in the last two years to expand in the Permian. Shale production can be brought on faster than deepwater and other oil exploration projects but requires near-constant drilling to maintain output.
Exxon's biggest cuts will come in the Permian, "where the short-cycle investments are more readily adjusted," said Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods.
He added that because shale wells produce big volumes at first and then decline rapidly, it is "beneficial in long term" to ensure "we're bringing those high production rates into a market that's more conducive." Exxon will sideline 75per cent of its Permian drilling rigs, keeping 15 working.
The company posted a US$610 million first-quarter loss, its first quarterly loss in three decades, on a nearly US$3 billion inventory writedown reflecting lower margins and prices. Chevron posted a US$3.6 billion profit on asset sales and improved refining results, and also said it would further reduce spending this year.
(For a graphic on Exxon's earnings, click here: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ygdpzydkyvw/index.html)
Both companies will slash spending budgets by 30per cent this year. Chevron cut its capital spending budget to US$14 billion and Exxon has set 2020 spending at US$23 billion, the lowest in four years.
Even though their results topped Wall Street's reduced estimates, Exxon shares fell 7per cent to US$43.14 while Chevron dropped 2.8per cent to US$89.44.
Chevron’s additional spending cuts will help it pay for its dividend and make it "a defensive energy holding and a relative safe haven in very stormy seas," said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones.
Exxon’s balance sheet "is strong enough to withstand the current environment," but it needs oil prices around US$75 per barrel this year to break even versus around US$50 on average for its peers, said Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited.
U.S. crude futures have recovered a bit since settling in negative territory on April 20, but the current price of around US$19 per barrel remains below the cost of production for many. International oil prices are around US$26 per barrel.
Both Chevron and Exxon maintained their quarterly dividends.
Other oil majors are also slashing investments and seeking ways to conserve cash. Royal Dutch Shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two and reported first-quarter profits down nearly half compared to a year-ago. BP Plc's first-quarter profit tumbled by two-thirds and its debt climbed to its highest on record.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Recovery of airline industry is vital for the health of the economy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ireland’s aviation industry has been devasted by the impact of Covid-19 on the economy. Stobart Air looks set to be rescued by the Stobart Group in the UK while CityJet is in examinership.
Yesterday, Ryanair announced plans to lay off 3,000 staff while Aer Lingus is to consult its employees on a plan to reduce its headcount by up to 20 per cent. Lockdown restrictions mean Aer Lingus flights are more about transporting cargo than passengers.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, the parent group of Aer Lingus, British Airways and other airlines, said it would be “several years” before air travel would get back to the level of 2019. Ryanair said the recovery in passenger demand and pricing will take at least two years, until summer 2022.
As an island nation, air travel is hugely important to the health of the Irish economy. The large network of flights to north America that has been built up over recent years has helped to underpin multinational investment from the United States.
And the tourists who come here usually disperse to the four corners of the State, helping to support rural communities throughout the country.
With EU state aid restrictions loosened, Aer France-KLM, Lufthansa and Swiss are just some of the big European airlines that have sought supports from their national governments. American carriers are being supported by Donald Trump’s administration.
Socialist TD Paul Murphy wants Aer Lingus renationalised, which would be a recipe for disaster.
Ryanair and Aer Lingus are both well capitalised businesses so they might not need access to direct financial support or credit at this point. But they will need support from the Government and state agencies to help rebuild their flight schedules over time, and market the country as open for business.
Getting back in the air is not just an imperative for the airlines, it is also vital for the health of the economy. There is huge aviation expertise here capable of devising a rescue plan for the sector. Forming a new Government and appointing a Minister for Transport to lead from the front would be a good start.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boeing raises $25bn in blowout debt sale</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair said on Friday that it planned to axe 3,000 pilot and cabin crew jobs, or 15 percent of staff, with air transport paralyzed by coronavirus.
Dublin-based Ryanair added that most of its flights would remain grounded until at least July and predicted it would take until summer 2022 at the earliest before passenger demand recovers.
The airline now expects to operate less than one percent of its scheduled flights in April, May and June.
“The Ryanair Airlines will shortly notify their trade unions about its restructuring and job loss program, which will commence from July 2020,” the group said in a statement.
“These plans will be subject to consultation but will affect all Ryanair Airlines, and may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid leave, and pay cuts of up to 20 percent, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers.”
The cost-cutting measures at the airline, which employs 18,000 staff worldwide, will be implemented “as a direct result of the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis,” it added.
Chief Executive Michael O’Leary has meanwhile agreed to extend his 50-percent pay cut for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021.
“Today we are announcing cuts of just over 15 percent, of which we have to lose regrettably about 3,000 mainly pilots and cabin crew over the next three to four months,” O’Leary told Bloomberg TV.
“That’s because this year we are now facing carrying less than a 100 million passengers against an original budget of 154 million passengers ... The situation is grim.”
“We expect to be allowed by the European governments to go back in July or from July onwards. What we are facing now is a historic decline in air traffic in Europe for the next 12-18 months.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Saudi Gazette reportRIYADH — Moody’s Investors Service, one of the world's leading rating agencies, affirmed Saudi Arabia’s sovereign credit rating at “A1”, however, it modified Kingdom’s outlook to “negative” from “stable”, Saudi Press Agency reported on Friday.The change in future outlook was the result of the outbreak of the coronavirus coupled with the crash of oil prices in the international market, according to Moody’s.“The negative outlook reflects increased downside risks to Saudi Arabia's fiscal strength stemming from the severe shock to global oil demand and prices triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, and from the uncertainty regarding the degree to which the government will be able to offset its oil revenue losses and stabilize its debt burden and assets in the medium term,” Moody’s said in a statement.Moody's noted that Saudi Arabia is the second largest oil producer in the world, and has significant oil reserves and low extraction costs, providing the Kingdom with a high degree of competitive advantage over other oil producers.In its report, Moody's stressed that the Saudi Arabia's “stable” rating reflects its effective monetary policy, credibility of the exchange rate, overall financial and economic stability, and signs of improvement in fiscal policy resulting from structural financial reforms with plans to diversify the economy away from oil.Moody's raised its estimate for the 2020 fiscal deficit from 8.7 percent to 12 percent of GDP.This will cause government debt to increase to around 38 percent of GDP by the end of 2021 from less than 23 percent of GDP in 2019, according to the statement.It is noteworthy that Fitch Ratings announced its rating for the Kingdom last week, which confirmed the long-term credit rating of Saudi Arabia at “A” with a stable future outlook.These positive estimations by the global rating agencies confirm the great confidence enjoyed by the Saudi economy, as well as the strength of its financial position in facing challenges, especially in light of crises in general and the current exceptional circumstances the world is currently experiencing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi Arabia’s outlook cut to negative by Moody’s</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: Saudi Arabia’s outlook was cut to negative from stable by Moody’s Investors Service after the crash in oil prices exposed the vulnerability of the kingdom’s finances amid the global pandemic and its reserves plunged to the lowest level in almost a decade.
The rating company kept the sovereign at A1, its fifth-highest grade, according to a statement on Friday. Moody’s last downgraded Saudi Arabia in 2016, and now has its assessment above those of Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings.
“The negative outlook reflects increased downside risks to Saudi Arabia’s fiscal strength stemming from the severe shock to global oil demand and prices triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, and from the uncertainty regarding the degree to which the government will be able to offset its oil revenue losses and stabilize its debt burden and assets in the medium term,” Moody’s said.
Under strain from the coronavirus and collapsing oil prices, Saudi Arabia is headed for an economic contraction this year while increasingly drawing down its savings. In March alone, the central bank’s net foreign assets fell by more than 5%, or more than 100 billion riyals ($27 billion).
The government is looking to its largest-ever debt program to keep the depletion of reserves at up to 120 billion riyals, as originally planned in the budget. Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan has also laid out plans to scale back spending after already cutting 50 billion riyals in expenditure.
Moody’s projects that Saudi’s fiscal deficit will widen to more than 12% of GDP in 2020 and more than 8% in GDP in 2021 from 4.5% of GDP in 2019. This will cause government debt to increase to around 38% of GDP by the end of 2021 from less than 23% of GDP in 2019, according to the statement.
The price of Brent crude crashed by more than 50% in March and has fallen further since then. It’s now trading around $25 a barrel - far short of the $76.1 the International Monetary Fund estimates Saudi Arabia needs to balance its budget.
Assuming a base case scenario of Brent averaging $35 and Saudi Arabia implementing further spending cuts this year, its fiscal deficit could widen to just under 15% of gross domestic product, according to Bilal Khan, senior economist at Standard Chartered Plc in Dubai.
“Limiting the drawdown in net foreign assets to pre-announced levels is certainly possible but would likely require additional borrowing, deeper spending cuts or further divestment of state assets,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Uber must face lawsuit claiming it stifled competition, drove out rival Sidecar</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc was ordered by a U.S. judge on Friday to face a lawsuit claiming its illegal predatory pricing and other anticompetitive practices stifled competition, and drove rival Sidecar Technologies Inc out of business.
Chief Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero of the federal court in San Francisco said SC Innovations, the successor to Sidecar, could try to prove that Uber tried to monopolize the ride-sharing business, by crowding out smaller rivals including Lyft Inc or making it harder for them to compete.
A spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Uber declined to comment. Spero had dismissed an earlier version of the lawsuit on Jan. 21.
Sidecar launched a ride-hailing service in 2012, and offered the first app to show passengers prices before booking rides, and to match passengers for car pooling.
The company, which was also based in San Francisco, shut down in December 2015, and sold its assets to General Motors Co the following year.
According to the complaint, Uber initially offered above-market incentives to drivers and low fares to passengers to amass market share, and then cut driver payments and raised fares, including through “surge” and “dynamic” pricing, to recoup its losses after cementing its dominance.
Uber was also accused of having secretly booked and then canceled rides on competitors’ apps, under programs known as “Project Hell” and “SLOG,” to induce frustrated drivers and passengers to work with the company.
“At this stage, the court finds Sidecar’s allegations of market power to be sufficiently plausible to avoid dismissal,” Spero wrote.
The case is SC Innovations Inc v Uber Technologies Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-07440.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Friday that the U.S. Small Business Administration gave it the green light to make $15 billion in new loans to some 211,000 business customers hurt by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
The largest U.S. bank said it expects to process a total of $29 billion in loans for around 239,000 customers as part of the government’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The average of these loans is for $123,000, according to a press release.
Congress gave the Small Business Administration (SBA) nearly $660 billion over the past two months for government-guaranteed, forgivable loans that businesses hurt by the epidemic could apply for at participating banks.
Faced with high demand from many of the country’s roughly 30 million small businesses, the program’s success was hindered by technology failures, a lack of clarity on the rules and paperwork required, and by banks’ struggles to quickly launch platforms to process the high volume of loan requests.
“Thousands of dedicated (staff) worked tirelessly over the past 30+ days to support the federal government in one of the largest and most ambitious emergency lending facilities in history,” JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement.
Big banks have faced criticism from policymakers for approving loans to businesses considered to be at the larger end of the small businesses range. This fueled concerns that the program’s funds would be exhausted before smaller, needier companies could apply.
Congress attempted to address this concern this week by ring-fencing $30 billion for banks with less than $10 billion in assets. But pent-up demand meant those funds were exhausted by Tuesday.
For its part, JPMorgan said on Friday that half of the PPP loans it processed went to companies with fewer than 5 employees, and 75% of the loans were for less than $100,000.
“We’ve followed (the government’s) direction to deploy this relief as quickly as possible and agree with their tightening of eligibility requirements so that funding goes to those that need it most,” Chief Executive of Chase Business Banking Jennifer Roberts said in a statement.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK: JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Friday that it received government approval to process roughly US$15 billion in loans through the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program, bringing its total number of funded loans through the program to about US$29 billion.
The latest batch of loans approved by the SBA will go to 211,000 business customers, the bank said. In total, the bank expects to issue PPP loans to 239,000 business customers, with the average loan amount being US$123,000.
Created as part of a US$2.3 trillion congressional economic relief package, the SBA's program allows small businesses hurt by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus to apply for government-guaranteed, forgivable loans with participating banks.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Esteban Duarte
(Bloomberg) —
Apparel retailer Reitmans (Canada) Ltd. said it is urgently seeking fresh money after existing bank facilities were terminated or reduced and the Covid-19 pandemic hurt business.
“The company is actively seeking additional financing and is also exploring various alternatives,” the Montreal-based clothier said in a May 1 statement. “If the company is unable to obtain such financing in the limited time period required, it may be unable to continue as a going concern.”
The outbreak of the coronavirus is having “significant impacts” as it closed all of its stores March 17, the company said.
Reitmans was already in a weakened state before the virus. The company’s net loss for the quarter ending February 1 was C$51.7 million compared with a net loss of C$8.9 million in the same quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 1% and gross profit declined.
The shares have lost 72% this year and 92% since the beginning of last year.
The results “have not met the company’s expectations. This is primarily due to the disappointing financial performance of the company’s plus-size banners,” the firm said in the statement. “Strategic brand changes implemented at the beginning of the fiscal year failed to resonate with the banners’ customer base.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reitmans Canada warns business could fail if it can’t secure financing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The uncertainty caused by COVID-19 has pushed retailer Reitmans Canada Ltd. to the brink, with the company warning on Friday that unless it is able to secure financing to meet its financial obligations, the business could fail.
“The company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to resume normal operations, generate future revenues and profitable operations, and obtain financing,” Reitmans said in a statement on Friday evening, adding it is “also exploring various alternatives.”
Reitmans is “actively seeking additional financing” and may be unable to continue if it “is unable to obtain such financing in the limited time period required​,” the statement said.
The Montreal-based company owns store banners including Reitmans, RW&Co., Penningtons and Addition Elle. Like many apparel retailers during the COVID-19 pandemic, Reitmans is considered a non-essential business. It was required to close all of its 582 stores across Canada in mid-March.
Even before the outbreak of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, the company had been cutting costs and its financial performance had been lagging expectations, largely because of declines at its plus-size banners, it said in the release.
Reitmans had been attempting to refresh those brands over the past year and had stepped up promotions, but did not win back customers. The company had already suspended its quarterly dividend to shareholders, and at a meeting on Friday the Reitmans board of directors decided to continue to do so in order to conserve cash, the statement said.
For nearly seven weeks, Reitmans has relied on e-commerce sales for all of its revenue, but economic uncertainty owing to wide-scale shutdowns of many industries could affect shopping behaviours, the company said, and it is still unclear when it will be able to reopen stores.
“Based on the company’s liquidity position as of the date of this press announcement, including the termination and reduction in availabilities under the company’s credit facilities … and in light of the uncertainty surrounding the outbreak, [Reitmans] estimates that it will need financing to meet its current and future financial obligations,” Friday’s statement said.
Reitmans reported results for its fiscal year ended Feb. 1 on Friday. The retailer reported sales of $869.5-million for the year, a 5.8-per-cent decline compared with the prior year. Comparable sales – an important metric that excludes the impact of store openings or closings – declined 1.3 per cent, including e-commerce sales. While Reitmans’ e-commerce sales are growing, store traffic was down 2.2 per cent last year.
The company said the decline was due mostly to disappointing sales at its plus-size stores, the closing of 18 stores and unseasonable weather in early 2019. Reitmans reported a net loss of $87.4-million or $1.56 a share, down from net earnings of nearly $6.8-million or 11 cents a share the year before. The decline includes an $11.8-million impairment charge.
