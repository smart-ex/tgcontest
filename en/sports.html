    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Premier League clubs have given the green light to play the remaining 2019-20 matches at eight neutral venues up and down the country, according to reports.
The clubs were presented with the league's 'Project Restart' plans at a meeting on Friday, and while a statement was issued reconfirming the clubs' commitment to finishing the season, it is understood there is no possibility that it can now finish on a home-and-away basis for safety reasons.
The restart plans were understood to have been well received, but there remains opposition on competition and integrity grounds about the idea of finishing the season at neutral venues.
It is understood the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing - which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
The Sun has listed eight venues on the table to complete the season, with Brighton's Amex Stadium and Southampton St Mary's potentially hosting matches on the south coast.
West Ham's London Stadium and Arsenal's Emirates home have been touted as venues in the capital, while Leicester's King Power and Aston Villa's Villa Park are the Midlands stadiums.
And Manchester United's Old Trafford, along with Manchester City's Etihad, will provide a north west base.
Wembley and St George's Park are back-up options, it is claimed.
It has also been reiterated that no club will play in their own stadium, to try and ensure Premier League integrity is maintained.
It is also understood the EFL is still intent on playing the remainder of its campaigns behind closed doors at the regular venues, but the governing body is aware current plans may need to change.
Clubs are expected to vote on the key principles of 'Project Restart' some time after May 7, when the Government must review the current UK lockdown.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gary Neville says Premier League clubs ‘frightened to death’ about speaking out on season’s restart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gary Neville has accused Premier League clubs of being “frightened to death” to publicly back the plan to restart the season.
Premier League stakeholders met on Friday to debate how to finish the current campaign, with reports that some clubs want to abandon the season due to the coronavirus pandemic and others are keen to play all remaining 92 fixtures.
Former Manchester United defender Neville believes clubs do not want to be held liable should a player become ill with the coronavirus if the English season resumes.
The French and Dutch seasons have been called off because of the health crisis and while the Premier League have apparently ear-marked a June return, that date is far from set in stone.
Claiming there needs to be more public comment from clubs, Neville wrote on Twitter: “The PL are having a [coronavirus] nightmare. They keep spouting Health First but then brief constantly ‘We have to Re-Start’.
“I’d respect them more if they said ‘We accept the increase in Health Risk but it’s one we are willing to take’. They won’t as they are frightened to death!”
When Neville was asked by a Twitter user what would happen if someone died as a result of the restart, he said: “That’s why we haven’t heard one single prominent CEO / Chairman / Owner or Executive open his mouth to back the re-start ! Brief / Brief / Brief ! Scared to death of the liability and blame.”
Before making an exception for Brighton as the “only club willing to take a stand”, Neville added: “It would be good for them to speak at least once. Any of them! Clubs included. They are bottling this virus on comms. Very Happy to tell us when they are delivering food parcels though.”
Brighton have held virtual press conferences during the shutdown and chief executive Paul Barber voiced opposition to the idea of finishing the season at neutral venues on his club’s official website on Saturday.
Despite Neville’s out-spoken claims, Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish did make the case for returning to action in a Sunday Times column.
“I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the ‘new normal’ might look for a lot of working environments,” Parish wrote.
“Not only that, in our country and beyond, people need to find ways to move forward mentally, to experience some small relief from the worries of this crisis.
“In my view a story here and a conversation there about the game last night will not trivialise loss or suffering but offer a tiny respite from it for many people. It has the power to lighten lives; why not see if we can use that power again?”
Neville later praised Parish for speaking out after being alerted to the article by the Palace chairman.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Grounds for concern: Brighton chief opposes the idea of games at neutral venues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has voiced opposition to the idea of finishing the Premier League season at neutral venues.
The PA news agency understands clubs were told on Friday that limiting action to a handful of selected stadiums was the only way it would be possible to complete the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season for safety reasons.
The latest updates to ‘Project Restart’ were understood to have been well received at a meeting on Friday, but there remained opposition on competition and integrity grounds about using neutral venues, and Barber confirmed Brighton are among those with reservations.
“Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government’s efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus,” he said on the club’s website.
“But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition.”
Brighton were due to be at home for five of their remaining nine matches as they fight for Premier League survival, and Barber fears the loss of home advantage could prove critical – even without fans.
“The disadvantages of us not playing the league’s top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious,” Barber said.
The PA news agency understands the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing – which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
Some reports had named the Amex as among the stadiums under consideration, but Barber said that was speculation at this stage.
“We haven’t been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches – by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police – and at this point we haven’t been approached to have such a discussion either so I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports,” he said.
West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady said that every Premier League club wants to complete the season but has warned there are “a lot of obstacles” to overcome.
“At yesterday’s meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart,” she wrote in her column for the Sun.
“We all know that it is going to take a lot of working together, good faith, careful thought and compromises if we have any chance of that happening.
“The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game…
Brady has detailed a four-phase strategy for a return to action, with the first one – isolated training sessions at training grounds – already under way.
Phase two would be a return to group training, phase three is the restart of domestic games, and the final phase would see a return to international matches.

Claiming there needs to be more public comment from clubs, Neville wrote on Twitter: “The PL are having a CV nightmare. They keep spouting Health First but then brief constantly ‘We have to Re-Start’.
“I’d respect them more if they said ‘We accept the increase in Health Risk but it’s one we are willing to take’. They won’t as they are frightened to death!”
When Neville was asked by a Twitter user what would happen if someone died as a result of the restart, he said: “That’s why we haven’t heard one single prominent CEO / Chairman / Owner or Executive open his mouth to back the re-start ! Brief / Brief / Brief ! Scared to death of the liability and blame.”
Before making an exception for Brighton and Hove Albion as the “only club willing to take a stand”, Neville added: “It would be good for them to speak at least once. Any of them! Clubs included. They are bottling this virus on comms. Very Happy to tell us when they are delivering food parcels though.”
Brighton have held virtual press conferences during the shutdown and chief executive Paul Barber voiced opposition to the idea of finishing the season at neutral venues on his club’s official website on Saturday.
Despite Neville’s outspoken claims, Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish did make the case for returning to action in a Sunday Times column.
“I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so EPL football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the ‘new normal’ might look for a lot of working environments,” Parish wrote.
“Not only that, in our country and beyond, people need to find ways to move forward mentally, to experience some small relief from the worries of this crisis.
“A story here and a conversation there about the game last night will not trivialise loss or suffering but offer a tiny respite from it for many people.
“It has the power to lighten lives; why not see if we can use that power again?”
Neville later praised Parish for speaking out after being alerted to the article by the Palace chairman. – AFP

Premier League stakeholders met on Friday to debate how to finish the current campaign, with reports that some clubs want to abandon the season due to the pandemic and others are keen to play all remaining 92 fixtures.
Former Manchester United defender Neville believes clubs do not want to be held liable should a player become ill with the coronavirus if the English season resumes.
The French and Dutch seasons have been called off because of the health crisis and while the Premier League have apparently ear-marked a June return, that date is far from set in stone.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Legal action fears if Premier League season doesn't finish: Steve Parish</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Premier League could face years of legal challenges if this season is not completed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the chairman of Crystal Palace warned Sunday.
Steve Parish offered public support for the league's "Project Restart" plans after relegation-threatened Brighton and West Ham expressed concerns about teams being forced to play their remaining games in neutral stadiums.
The league is working with the government to find a safe way for players to resume group training and play games by June at the earliest.
But the French and Dutch league seasons have already been halted by their governments amid ongoing concerns about sporting fixtures spreading COVID-19 infections. While Paris Saint-Germain was crowned French champion last week despite Ligue 1 ending prematurely, Ajax will not be awarded the Dutch title.
"I want to complete the competition for reasons of sporting integrity," Parish said in a column published Sunday on the Palace website. "I want to crown Liverpool champions and give every other club a fair crack at the best league position they can achieve. I certainly don't want to have difficult conversations about curtailing, voiding and points per game.
"The ramifications of each are complex and could involve legal challenges that run on for months, if not years. But, yes, it is partly about the money. And we should all care about the money."
Parish highlighted the "many secondary industries football enriches," with the Premier League fearing losses of more than 1 billion pounds from an incomplete campaign as broadcasting commitments are not met.
"Nobody wins if the Premier League receives less money," Parish said. "Football is one of the most efficient tax-generating industries in Britain: we pay the players a lot but 50 percent goes straight back into the public purse. Overall we pay about 3.3 billion pounds in tax every year and it is the Premier League that largely funds the whole football pyramid."
The national lockdown remains in place through Thursday in Britain where more than 28,000 people have died in around two months in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for the new coronavirus.
Parish's explanation of "Project Restart" came as the Premier League faced heavy criticism from one of the main pundits for the broadcaster that provides the league's single biggest revenue stream.
Gary Neville, the former England and Manchester United defender turned Sky Sports commentator, said the Premier League was having a "nightmare" and was "hiding, scared to death of communicating" its plans fully in public. The league has not made any official available for interview since the competition was suspended almost two months ago.
"I want football to return. I also understand the complexities," Neville said in a response to Parish's tweet linking to his column. "No one wants to be responsible for this one! Just in case the unthinkable happens. ... I'd respect them more if they said `We accept the increase in Health Risk but it's one we are willing to take.' They won't as they are frightened to death!"
The Spanish league has been communicating its plans more substantially ahead of players resuming training individually at the clubs' facilities on Monday while observing a series of safety measures pre-established by the league and local authorities, including regular COVID-19 testing.
There is more uncertainty in Italy where the government has only allowed players in regions containing eight of the 20 Serie A clubs to resume individual training from Monday.
While the leagues in England, Italy and Spain will not start until at least June, the German top flight is hoping to resume this month.
But the Bundesliga's plans were unsettled by three positive tests for coronavirus last week at Cologne, reportedly including two players.
Cologne has insisted that there is no need for the rest of the squad and coaching staff to go into quarantine.
"The prerequisite for this is, of course, that now that we have started testing, we continue to test consistently, thus ensuring that only those who have tested negatively are part of training," team doctor Paul Klein said.
Cologne said Sunday that players will only resume training after two consecutive negative COVID-19 tests.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League clubs 'preparing for entire 2020-21 season to be played out behind closed doors'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Premier League clubs are reportedly preparing for the possibility of playing the entirety of next season behind closed doors.
Discussions around a resumption to the 2019-20 season are due to continue this week, with the hope that the remaining 92 matches can be played throughout the summer months to conclude the campaign.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, fans will not be in attendance for those matches and it’s expected that the start of next season will also begin behind closed doors.
Now, Sky Sportsis reporting that top-flight clubs are preparing for the possibility of the entirety of the 2019-20 campaign taking place without fans in attendance.
Such action would affect all competitions, including the FA Cup and Uefa’s European competitions, and would be a significant blow to the revenue streams of all Premier League clubs.
The possibility of having no fans in attendance for a whole season would be even more devastating for clubs in the lower leagues of the EFL, which would also be affected, where the gate receipts are an important part of the running of the club.
Clubs have already been hit heavily by the financial implications of the crisis, which is expected to have long-lasting effects on the economy both in general and within the sporting world.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Premier League and its clubs are “frightened to death” about publicly backing the resumption of the season as they do not want to be held liable if someone dies because of the coronavirus, television pundit Gary Neville said on Sunday.
Professional football has been suspended since mid-March due to the COVID-19pandemic which has infected over 182,000 people in the United Kingdom, killing more than 28,000.
The 20 Premier League clubs held a conference call on Friday in which they looked at plans for a resumption of training this month but deferred making a decision on resuming the season until the government gave the go-ahead.
The government had originally set May 7 as the day it would review lockdown restrictions.
“The PL are having a CV nightmare. They keep spouting health first but then brief constantly ‘We have to re-start’,” Neville wrote on Twitter here

When a Twitter user asked him what would happen if they restarted the season and someone died, Neville said: “That’s why we haven’t heard one single prominent CEO, Chairman, Owner or Executive open his mouth to back the re-start.
“Scared to death of the liability and blame.”
The clubs have reviewed plans for resuming training which will initially be restricted to small groups of players with no use of indoor facilities. Some clubs started individual sessions for players at their training grounds last week.
Neville said that although he understands the complexities of a return to action, it was “depressing” to see the league and clubs not communicating their plans.
“It would be good for them (the Premier League) to speak at least once. Any of them! Clubs included,” the former Manchester United and England defender added when it was suggested to him that the league has press briefings.
“They are bottling this virus on comms (communications). Very happy to tell us when they are delivering food parcels though.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Legal action fears if Prem doesn't finish</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">English Premier League clubs opposed to resuming the season in empty, neutral stadiums were urged by the Crystal Palace chairman on Sunday to accept the plans or the “game might never fully recover.”
Steve Parish warned there could be years of legal challenges if the Premier League is curtailed, with French clubs already exploring damages claims over their season prematurely ending last week.
A leading sports lawyer also raised the prospect of players refusing to take to the field if they feel unsafe playing as the coronavirus pandemic continues.
Parish's support for the league's "Project Restart" proposal came as Brighton and West Ham publicly resisted playing their remaining home games in neutral venues as they fight relegation.
The league is working with authorities to find a way for players to resume group training and play games by June at the earliest while ensuring that does not spread COVID-19 infections.
“We need to try to play if we can make it safe,” Parish tweeted. “I believe we can and should continue however imperfect the other elements: neutral venues empty stadia, etc. If we can’t make it work then I fear for next season. The game might never fully recover.”
Government rulings led to the French and Dutch league seasons ending last week. While Paris Saint-Germain was crowned French champion with 10 rounds of games remaining, Ajax - which was first on goal difference - will not be awarded the Dutch title.
Palace has little to play for, sitting midtable, but Parish said he wants the season completed for “reasons of sporting integrity" and to protect the league's finances. Liverpool is 25 points clear with nine games remaining.
“I want to crown Liverpool champions and give every other club a fair crack at the best league position they can achieve," Parish said. "I certainly don’t want to have difficult conversations about curtailing, voiding and points per game.
"The ramifications of each are complex and could involve legal challenges that run on for months, if not years. But, yes, it is partly about the money. And we should all care about the money.”
The Premier League fears losses of more than 1 billion pounds (around $1.3 billion) from an incomplete campaign as broadcasting commitments are not met.
The league has not commented on opposition to playing games in neutral stadiums, only saying after Friday's call with clubs that they all wanted to complete the season if it was safe.
“Ending the season early would undoubtedly leave the Premier League more exposed to costly and reputationally damaging legal action from certain disgruntled clubs, unhappy with the difficult decisions that would ultimately follow in determining league positions,” lawyer Simon Leaf, head of sport at Mishcon de Reya, told The Associated Press.
“After all, a significant portion of the revenues that the clubs receive from broadcasters and sponsors is related to where the club finishes in the table.”
Players would have to face regular COVID-19 tests to show they were clear of the disease.
“We could still see players themselves take their own legal stand by refusing to take the field for fear of their own safety and clubs unhappy with the venue allocations threaten action," Leaf said.
It is almost two months since the competition was suspended and the league's rule book has no guidelines for resolving standings if a team cannot play all 38 games.
“The league will need to continue to manage the situation delicately in order to keep all sides on board and avoid league places and revenues being determined in the courtroom rather than on the pitch,” Leaf said.
The national lockdown remains in place through at least Thursday in Britain where more than 28,000 people have died in around two months in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for the new coronavirus.
The Premier League faced heavy criticism Sunday from one of the main pundits for the broadcaster that provides the league's single biggest revenue stream.
Gary Neville, the former England and Manchester United defender turned Sky Sports commentator, said the Premier League was having a “nightmare" and was “hiding, scared to death of communicating” its plans fully in public.
“No one wants to be responsible for this one! Just in case the unthinkable happens," Neville tweeted. "I’d respect them more if they said ‘We accept the increase in Health Risk but it’s one we are willing to take.' They won’t as they are frightened to death!"
Some Premier League players returned to club training facilities last week to resume individual work. Players in Spain and Italy will be allowed to do the same from Monday.
While the leagues in England, Italy and Spain will not start until at least June, the German top flight is hoping to resume this month.
But the Bundesliga's plans were unsettled by three positive tests for coronavirus last week at Cologne, reportedly including two players.
Cologne said Sunday that players will only resume training after two consecutive negative COVID-19 tests, ruling out the need for the entire squad and coaching staff to go into quarantine.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gary Neville claims Premier League are ‘frightened’ to back season restart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gary Neville has criticised the Premier League and its clubs for failing to make the case for a return to action.
The former Manchester United and England defender accused them of being “frightened to death” to publicly back plans to restart the season for fear of being held liable should something go wrong.
Premier League clubs met on Friday to reaffirm their commitment to resuming the campaign and are understood to have earmarked June 8 as a best-case scenario to return following the coronavirus suspension.
But Neville feels there has been too much anonymous briefing and not enough public declarations.
Neville wrote on Twitter: “The PL are having a CV nightmare. They keep spouting Health First but then brief constantly “We have to Re-Start”. I’d respect them more if they said “We accept the increase in Health Risk but it’s one we are willing to take”. They won’t as they are frightened to death!”
When Neville was asked by a Twitter user what would happen if someone died as a result of the restart, he said: “That’s why we haven’t heard one single prominent CEO / Chairman / Owner or Executive open his mouth to back the re-start ! Brief / Brief / Brief ! Scared to death of the liability and blame.”
Before making an exception for Brighton as the “only club willing to take a stand”, Neville added: “It would be good for them to speak at least once. Any of them! Clubs included. They are bottling this virus on comms. Very Happy to tell us when they are delivering food parcels though.”
The Premier League announced on Friday that clubs had again confirmed their commitment to finishing the season.
A statement added: “The League and clubs are considering the first tentative moves forward and will only return to training and playing with Government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers.
“The League welcomed the creation of the Government medical working group for a return of elite sport, which met for the first time this morning.
“No decisions were taken at today’s shareholders’ meeting and clubs exchanged views on the information provided regarding ‘Project Restart’.”
Brighton have held virtual press conferences during the shutdown and chief executive Paul Barber voiced opposition to the idea of finishing the season at neutral venues on his club’s official website on Saturday.
West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady revealed more details about the plans in a newspaper column on Saturday and Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish made the case for returning to action in a Sunday Times column.
Parish claimed the return of football, if considered appropriate, would be a boost to the taxpayer, lift the nation’s mental health and could help provide a blueprint for other industries to define a “new normal” amid the pandemic.
Neville later praised Parish for speaking out after being alerted to the article by the Palace chairman but reiterated his general point.
The TV pundit wrote: “Steve I want football to return. I also understand the complexities. However it’s depressing that the PL and clubs seem to be in hiding, scared to death of communicating. No-one wants to be responsible for this one! Just in case the unthinkable happens.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wolves could play entire 2020/21 season behind closed doors - report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Wolves and the rest of the Premier League clubs are preparing for the possibility of playing the entirety of next season behind closed doors..
Discussions around a resumption of the 2019/20 season are due to continue this week, with the hope that the remaining 92 matches can be played throughout the summer months to conclude the campaign.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, fans will not be in attendance for those matches and it’s expected that the start of next season will also begin behind closed doors.
Now, Sky Sports is reporting that top-flight clubs are preparing for the possibility of the entirety of the 2020/2021 campaign taking place without fans in attendance - which would also impact the EFL, if required to be put in place.
Such action would affect all competitions, including the FA Cup and UEFA’s European competitions, and would be a significant blow to the revenue streams of Premier League clubs.
The possibility of having no fans in attendance for a whole season would be even more devastating for clubs in the lower leagues of the EFL, where the gate receipts are an important part of the running of the club.
Clubs have already been hit heavily by the financial implications of the crisis, which is expected to have long-lasting effects on the economy both in general and within the sporting world.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League club inform players they can 'opt out' of return over health and safety fears</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One Premier League club has reportedly informed its players that they have the right to turn down Project Restart - the plan to resume top-flight football in England.
Players at rival sides are outraged that they have not received the same offer from their own clubs, according to The Sun, after hearing about the opt out option via a WhatsApp group.
The group was initially set up for the captains of the 20 Premier League clubs, but now has over 100 members.
The unnamed squad has been told that they may opt out of the initiative over health and safety concerns - and the move could prompt other clubs to do the same.
Project Restart aims to resume football on 12 June but could face disruption due to health and safety concerns, with some players feeling they are being told to return to action before it is safe to do so.
However, only one club has so far informed its players that they are free to not play a game, or even the remainder of the season, if they do not feel comfortable.
If you’re unable to see the survey, click here.
This has left stars at other clubs questioning why they have not been extended similar blanket offers amid concerns that players who choose not to play will be criticised individually rather than as a united front.
After teams returned to training in Germany, three people at Bundesliga club Cologne tested positive for coronavirus, heightening fears among players in other leagues who are set to return to action.
Some players feel like their voice is not being heard, which was echoed by Chelsea manager Frank Lampard after Friday's meeting between Premier League chiefs.
“The things I welcomed were the fact player and staff safety will come first and the fact that they are going to have conversations with players and managers," Lampard told BT Sport.
"That hasn’t really happened, to be honest.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why neutral venues could undermine EPL's integrity</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber fears plans to complete the Premier League season at neutral venues could have a "material effect on the integrity of the competition."
As the tournament wrestles with how to finish the campaign which still has 92 games to play, the idea of using up to 10 neutral venues for the behind closed doors games is seen as the only means to guarantee safety.
"Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus," Barber told the Brighton website.
"But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition."
Brighton were due to be at home for five of their remaining nine matches as they fight for their Premier League lives.
Barber worries the loss of home advantage could prove critical - even without fans.
"The disadvantages of us not playing the league's top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious," Barber said.
"Clearly, we must accept there may also be some benefit from playing our remaining four away matches at neutral venues but the fixture list simply isn't equally balanced at this stage of the season, and we didn't play our first 29 matches of the season in this way.
"So, in our opinion one thing doesn't cancel out the other."
Britain's Press Associaton claimed the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing - which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
Some reports had even named Brighton's Amex Stadium as among the stadiums under consideration.
However, Barber said it was speculation at this stage.
"We haven't been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches - by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police.
"So I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gary Neville claims Premier League are ‘frightened’ to back season restart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Neville has urged more clubs to speak out about Project Restart instead of briefing.
Gary Neville has criticised the Premier League and its clubs for failing to make the case for a return to action.
The former Manchester United and England defender accused them of being “frightened to death” to publicly back plans to restart the season for fear of being held liable should something go wrong.
Premier League clubs met on Friday to reaffirm their commitment to resuming the campaign and are understood to have earmarked June 8 as a best-case scenario to return following the coronavirus suspension.
But Neville feels there has been too much anonymous briefing and not enough public declarations.
Neville wrote on Twitter: “The PL are having a CV nightmare. They keep spouting Health First but then brief constantly “We have to Re-Start”. I’d respect them more if they said “We accept the increase in Health Risk but it’s one we are willing to take”. They won’t as they are frightened to death!”
When Neville was asked by a Twitter user what would happen if someone died as a result of the restart, he said: “That’s why we haven’t heard one single prominent CEO / Chairman / Owner or Executive open his mouth to back the re-start ! Brief / Brief / Brief ! Scared to death of the liability and blame.”
Before making an exception for Brighton as the “only club willing to take a stand”, Neville added: “It would be good for them to speak at least once. Any of them! Clubs included. They are bottling this virus on comms. Very Happy to tell us when they are delivering food parcels though.”
The Premier League announced on Friday that clubs had again confirmed their commitment to finishing the season.
A statement added: “The League and clubs are considering the first tentative moves forward and will only return to training and playing with Government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers.
“The League welcomed the creation of the Government medical working group for a return of elite sport, which met for the first time this morning.
“No decisions were taken at today’s shareholders’ meeting and clubs exchanged views on the information provided regarding ‘Project Restart’.”
Brighton have held virtual press conferences during the shutdown and chief executive Paul Barber voiced opposition to the idea of finishing the season at neutral venues on his club’s official website on Saturday.
West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady revealed more details about the plans in a newspaper column on Saturday and Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish made the case for returning to action in a Sunday Times column.
Parish claimed the return of football, if considered appropriate, would be a boost to the taxpayer, lift the nation’s mental health and could help provide a blueprint for other industries to define a “new normal” amid the pandemic.
Neville later praised Parish for speaking out after being alerted to the article by the Palace chairman but reiterated his general point.
The TV pundit wrote: “Steve I want football to return. I also understand the complexities. However it’s depressing that the PL and clubs seem to be in hiding, scared to death of communicating. No-one wants to be responsible for this one! Just in case the unthinkable happens.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gary Neville rages at Premier League chiefs and pinpoints the nightmare scenario that's left them 'frightened to death'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gary Neville has accused Premier League bosses and clubs of being terrified to publicly back a return to action.
The former Manchester United defender insists the game's powerbrokers are in hiding over rubberstamping their intent to bring back football behind closed doors.
Neville alluded to the nightmare scenario of a player or staff member falling seriously ill with COVID-19 after play has resumed breeding reluctance among decision makers.
So, far Brighton are the only top-flight club to speak out against "Project Restart", while Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero insists players are "scared" to get back on the pitch.
Clubs met on Friday to discuss the ongoing situation, with June 8 reportedly earmarked as a provisional return date.
And Neville wrote on Twitter: "The PL are having a CV nightmare. They keep spouting Health First but then brief constantly "We have to Re-Start" I'd respect them more if they said "We accept the increase in Health Risk but it's one we are willing to take". They won't as they are frightened to death!"
He continued: "I want football to return. I also understand the complexities.
"However it’s depressing that the PL and clubs seem to be in hiding, scared to death of communicating. No-one wants to be responsible for this one! Just in case the unthinkable happens."
The Sky Sports pundit made an exception for Brighton before adding: "It would be good for them to speak at least once. Any of them! Clubs included. They are bottling this virus on comms. Very Happy to tell us when they are delivering food parcels though."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Agent outlines bold plan to finish Premier League season in Perth</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Australian city of Perth could host the remaining matches of the coronavirus-hit 2019-20 Premier League season under an audacious plan, according to agent Gary Williams.
The Premier League has been postponed since Marchbecause of the COVID-19 crisis and it remains to be seen whether the campaign will resume.
Amid speculation and concerns, the Premier League reconfirmed the commitment of its clubs to restart the season when it is safe to do so— a plan to play games behind closed doors and potentially at a neutral venue has been reported.

While the United Kingdom struggles to contain the virus, which has killed at least 28,100 people in the country, Perth has emerged as a shocking location to kick-start the interrupted campaign. Australia has seen fewer than 7,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and at least 93 casualties.
Williams — who is based in Perth — sensationally plots to bring Premier League fixtures to Optus Stadium and the Western Australia Cricket Association (WACA) Ground. Optus Stadium played host to Manchester United during their preseason trip ahead of the 2019-20 campaign, while Chelsea also traveled to Perth in 2018.
"We've got the venues, we've got the weather and we are in control of the coronavirus at the moment," Williams told Australia's "ABC Grandstand" on Sunday. "You would need four facilities and the timing is absolutely brilliant, because we could kick off over here at 6 p.m., 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. And 10 p.m. kickoff here would be 3 p.m. in the afternoon there and we'd also have coverage worldwide all through Asia and America.
"Timing-wise, this is the ideal place, and also health- and safety-wise and facility-wise, it's the ideal place, Perth."
Williams added: "The players would have to be in isolation for two weeks [after traveling to Australia from the UK]. After the two weeks, all the games would be televised with no crowds.
"We'd be looking at Optus [Stadium], the WACA and probably [HBF] Arena. They could use local state league clubs to do the training."
Liverpool was 25 points clear atop the table through 29 games when the Premier League was suspended.
Both the Eredivisie (Netherlands) and Ligue 1 (France) seasons have been abandoned in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League clubs agree to use neutral grounds at Arsenal, Man Utd and West Ham when Gov gives green light to return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PREMIER LEAGUE clubs have agreed to use neutral stadiums to finish the season once the Government gives football the green light to resume.
Brighton were among a number of teams who had wanted to preserve home advantage when games returned behind closed doors.
But after a 3½-hour video meeting of the 20 “shareholder” clubs, plans to use “eight to ten neutral stadiums” were given the thumbs-up.
Clubs confirmed their target of starting general training from May 18, with the first Prem fixtures now pencilled in for Friday, June 12 — the same date Euro 2020 would have kicked off.
SunSport first told you about plans to use neutral venues to play out the season on March 18.
The grounds, all of which will be current Prem stadiums, will be confirmed in the next two weeks.
But police concerns over using congested urban areas and fans converging in the vicinity of the stadiums — and potentially causing coronavirus-spreading clusters — will mean grounds includingAnfield and Stamford Bridge being ruled out.
SunSport understands the strongest candidates for the eight grounds in the Premier League are:
Wembley and St George’s Park are understood to have been discounted as options.
But no club will play in their own stadium, to try to ensure a degree of equality in the unprecedented circumstances.
And while six clubs are understood to have voiced some significant doubts over whether the desire to finish the campaign is wise, the majority view was to push ahead as long as there isclearance from the Government.
It also means that when Liverpool seal the title — as seems likely with a 25-point lead over second-placed Manchester City — it will NOT be at Anfield.
A Prem insider said: “It’s pretty clear we will have to play behind closed doors when we come back — including, probably, into next season.
“Nobody wants that but we cannot deny the reality.
“This is seen by everybody as the best option in the circumstances and we recognise that we must choose venues where we can ensure only those authorised to be there will be in and around thestadium.
“Of course, there are a range of views around the League and clubs. They all have their own stances and positions.
“But it was generally agreed that we should do everything we can to try to finish the season.”
The key to that will be the Government lifting its current lockdown restrictions, with a decision due on Thursday.
Prem clubs will meet again the following morning when they have had time to assess the latest position.
A further meeting is scheduled for May 18, the date it is hoped training can restart.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRIGHTON: Brighton chief executive Paul Barber fears plans to complete the Premier League season at neutral venues could have a “material effect on the integrity of the competition.”
As the tournament wrestles with how to finish the campaign which still has 92 games to play, the idea of using up to 10 neutral venues for the behind closed doors games is seen as the only means to guarantee safety.
“Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government’s efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus,” Barber told the Brighton website.
“But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition.”
Brighton were due to be at home for five of their remaining nine matches as they fight for their Premier League lives.
Barber worries the loss of home advantage could prove critical – even without fans.
“The disadvantages of us not playing the league’s top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious,” Barber said.
“Clearly, we must accept there may also be some benefit from playing our remaining four away matches at neutral venues but the fixture list simply isn’t equally balanced at this stage of the season, and we didn’t play our first 29 matches of the season in this way.
“So, in our opinion, one thing doesn’t cancel out the other.”
Britain’s Press Associaton claimed the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing – which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
Some reports had even named Brighton’s Amex Stadium as among the stadiums under consideration.
However, Barber said it was speculation at this stage.
“We haven’t been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches – by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police.
“So I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Premier League clubs ‘frightened’ to publicly back restart’ – Gary Neville</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON (AFP) – Gary Neville has accused Premier League clubs of being “frightened to death” to publicly back the plan to restart the season.
Premier League stakeholders met on Friday to debate how to finish the current campaign, with reports that some clubs want to abandon the season due to the pandemic and others are keen to play all remaining 92 fixtures.
Former Manchester United defender Neville believes clubs do not want to be held liable should a player become ill with the coronavirus if the English season resumes.
The French and Dutch seasons have been called off because of the health crisis and while the Premier League have apparently ear-marked a June return, that date is far from set in stone.
Claiming there needs to be more public comment from clubs, Neville wrote on Twitter: “The PL are having a CV nightmare. They keep spouting Health First but then brief constantly ‘We have to Re-Start’.
“I’d respect them more if they said ‘We accept the increase in Health Risk but it’s one we are willing to take’. They won’t as they are frightened to death!”
When Neville was asked by a Twitter user what would happen if someone died as a result of the restart, he said: “That’s why we haven’t heard one single prominent CEO / Chairman / Owner or Executive open his mouth to back the re-start ! Brief / Brief / Brief ! Scared to death of the liability and blame.”
Before making an exception for Brighton as the “only club willing to take a stand”, Neville added: “It would be good for them to speak at least once. Any of them! Clubs included. They are bottling this virus on comms. Very Happy to tell us when they are delivering food parcels though.”
Brighton have held virtual press conferences during the shutdown and chief executive Paul Barber voiced opposition to the idea of finishing the season at neutral venues on his club’s official website on Saturday.
Despite Neville’s out-spoken claims, Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish did make the case for returning to action in a Sunday Times column.
“I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the ‘new normal’ might look for a lot of working environments,” Parish wrote.
“Not only that, in our country and beyond, people need to find ways to move forward mentally, to experience some small relief from the worries of this crisis.
“In my view a story here and a conversation there about the game last night will not trivialise loss or suffering but offer a tiny respite from it for many people. It has the power to lighten lives; why not see if we can use that power again?”
Neville later praised Parish for speaking out after being alerted to the article by the Palace chairman.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Divisions over EPL's neutral venues plan, legal action fears</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">English Premier League clubs opposed to resuming the season in empty, neutral stadiums were urged by the Crystal Palace chairman on Sunday to accept the plans or the “game might never fully recover.”
Steve Parish warned there could be years of legal challenges if the Premier League is curtailed, with French clubs already exploring damages claims over their season prematurely ending last week.
A leading sports lawyer also raised the prospect of players refusing to take to the field if they feel unsafe playing as the coronavirus pandemic continues.
Parish’s support for the league’s “Project Restart” proposal came as Brighton and West Ham publicly resisted playing their remaining home games in neutral venues as they fight relegation.
The league is working with authorities to find a way for players to resume group training and play games by June at the earliest while ensuring that does not spread COVID-19 infections.
“We need to try to play if we can make it safe,” Parish tweeted. “I believe we can and should continue however imperfect the other elements: neutral venues empty stadia, etc. If we can’t make it work then I fear for next season. The game might never fully recover.”
Government rulings led to the French and Dutch league seasons ending last week. While Paris Saint-Germain was crowned French champion with 10 rounds of games remaining, Ajax - which was first on goal difference - will not be awarded the Dutch title.
Palace has little to play for, sitting midtable, but Parish said he wants the season completed for “reasons of sporting integrity” and to protect the league’s finances. Liverpool is 25 points clear with nine games remaining.
“I want to crown Liverpool champions and give every other club a fair crack at the best league position they can achieve,” Parish said. “I certainly don’t want to have difficult conversations about curtailing, voiding and points per game.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FIFA Vice-President Suggests Adapting European Season to Calendar Year Format</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With all of the uncertainty the coronavirus pandemic has brought, it's hard to envisage a time where football will be played under normal circumstances again.
The Bundesliga are hoping to resume behind closed doors this month but with extensive measures, and they've already had to push their schedule back.
Meanwhile, the Premier League are attempting to launch 'Project Restart' in a bid to finish the season, with games being played at neutral grounds. However, not all clubs have agreed to these plans.
Restarting football seems unthinkable at times, and FIFA vice-president and CONCACAF president Victor Montagliani, has said that the idea of moving European seasons to follow a calendar year format is a 'possibility'.
"We have the opportunity because the World Cup in Qatar in 2022 will be played in November/December and that could be the idea," Montagliani told Radio Sportiva, as quoted by the Telegraph.
"Here in the Americas, the season is already played according to the calendar year, perhaps it is a solution that could also be used in Europe and Africa, it is a possibility to be discussed at national and continental level.
"It is not an idea to be discarded, it can be a solution in view of the next two years and this winter World Cup."
While most countries are attempting to soldier on and conclude their campaigns, the decision has been made in Belgium, France and the Netherlands to finish the season immediately.
UEFA are looking to conclude the Champions League and Europa League in August (though French clubs have been forbidden by their government to play in the country again until September at the earliest), with domestic competitions wrapped up by the end of July.
While there seems a wide persistence to keep the football schedule relatively similar moving forward, Montagliani added that the pandemic gives FIFA a chance to rejig the calendar as they see fit.
"We had already started thinking about how to set a new calendar from 2024, now with this crisis we need immediate answers," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brighton oppose idea of finishing season at neutral venues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The PA news agency understands clubs were told on Friday that limiting action to a handful of selected stadiums was the only way it would be possible to complete the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season for safety reasons.
The latest updates to 'Project Restart' were understood to have been well received at a meeting on Friday, but there remained opposition on competition and integrity grounds about using neutral venues, and Barber confirmed Brighton are among those with reservations.
"Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus," he said on the club's website.
"But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition."
Brighton were due to be at home for five of their remaining nine matches as they fight for Premier League survival, and Barber fears the loss of home advantage could prove critical – even without fans.
"The disadvantages of us not playing the league's top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious," Barber said.
"Clearly, we must accept there may also be some benefit from playing our remaining four away matches at neutral venues but the fixture list simply isn't equally balanced at this stage of the season, and we didn't play our first 29 matches of the season in this way. So, in our opinion one thing doesn't cancel out the other."
The PA news agency understands the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing – which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
Some reports had named the Amex as among the stadiums under consideration, but Barber said that was speculation at this stage.
"We haven't been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches – by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police – and at this point we haven't been approached to have such a discussion either so I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports," he said.
West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady said that every Premier League club wants to complete the season but has warned there are "a lot of obstacles" to overcome.
"At yesterday's meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart," she wrote in her column for the Sun.
"We all know that it is going to take a lot of working together, good faith, careful thought and compromises if we have any chance of that happening.
"The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game...
"There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make."
Brady has detailed a four-phase strategy for a return to action, with the first one – isolated training sessions at training grounds – already under way.
Phase two would be a return to group training, phase three is the restart of domestic games, and the final phase would see a return to international matches.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Brighton chief refutes reports of using Amex Stadium as a neutral ground</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brighton and Hove Albion's deputy chairman Paul Barber says the club have not been approached to use the Amex Stadium as a neutral ground in the event of a Premier League restart.
Reports have suggested one option being considered by the Premier League, should the competition be allowed to resume amid the coronavirus crisis, is to hold all matches behind closed doors at neutral venues.
The Amex is rumoured to be one of the grounds under consideration, yet Barber has suggested the reports are, as it stands, wide of the mark.
"We haven't been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches – by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police – and at this point we haven't been approached to have such a discussion either so I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports," Barber wrote in a statement on the club's official website.
"Some newspapers reported that the use of a small number of neutral venues may be the only way to complete the Premier League season to ensure social distancing policies are maintained, and Albion was named as one of a number of clubs against such a move."
Barber also added that Brighton – who were battling relegation prior to the suspension of the season – would not be satisfied with switching matches to neutral stadiums.
"We do of course understand that in the very difficult circumstances we are facing that every option must be considered – but that should only be when safe to do so for all concerned and, if and when we reach that point, we are not in favour of playing our remaining matches at neutral venues," he wrote.
"Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.
"But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition.
"Five of our nine remaining matches due to be played at the Amex – all five matches are very difficult but four are against some of the biggest clubs in European football."
Brighton were set to welcome Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City to the Amex in their next four home matches.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Shaun Wright-Phillips proposes fresh idea to conclude Premier League season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Chelsea winger Shaun Wright-Phillips believes the current Premier League campaign should be declared null and void, and Liverpool given a ten or 15-point head start for the 2020/2021 season.
The Covid-19 pandemic has brought a halt to all top-flight action since early March, with no fixed date for when the competition will resume.
On Friday, Premier League clubs reiterated their desire to complete the remaining 92 fixtures, even if they have to played at neutral venues.
Other European countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and France have all decided to cancel their seasons, with Ligue 1 declaring league leaders Paris Saint-Germain as champions.
If the same rules were to be applied in England, Liverpool would win the Premier League, ending their 30-year wait for a league title, but Wright-Phillips offered up a different solution.
He told Football Fancast: ‘I would just null and void the season. Liverpool deserve to win the title but then if you give them the title, then you have to give them a bonus and where’s the Premier League making their money from now?
‘Then if you give them the title, realistically you have to relegate the three teams.
‘There are like three or four points between them down at the bottom, so then there’ll be an argument on that side.
‘And then if you do that, then you’ve got to decide who’s getting promoted and who wins the play-offs without even going into it.
‘So I think it’s a little bit more difficult than just giving Liverpool the title. I would just null and void it, even if they then gave Liverpool a 10/15 point headstart next year.’
With the UK surpassing 28,000 coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday, Wright-Phillips doesn’t think football can continue until it is safe to do so.
‘I’d rather be bored now and be able to watch the Premier League next year with the Premier League’s greatest players in it rather than them risk it and God forbid anything bad happens,’ he said.
‘We need to put people’s health before money and TV.
‘I think they have to cancel it. Don’t get me wrong, I’d love to be sat here watching the Premier League in lockdown.
‘There’s nothing to do so I can see why people would want it on but it’s not worth people’s health – these players have all got families.’

"We haven't been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches - by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police.
"So I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Grounds for concern: Brighton chief opposes the idea of games at neutral venues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paul Barber wary finishing the Premier League season at a handful of selected stadiums.
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has voiced opposition to the idea of finishing the Premier League season at neutral venues.
The PA news agency understands clubs were told on Friday that limiting action to a handful of selected stadiums was the only way it would be possible to complete the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season for safety reasons.
The latest updates to ‘Project Restart’ were understood to have been well received at a meeting on Friday, but there remained opposition on competition and integrity grounds about using neutral venues, and Barber confirmed Brighton are among those with reservations.
“Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government’s efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus,” he said on the club’s website.
“But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition.”
Brighton were due to be at home for five of their remaining nine matches as they fight for Premier League survival, and Barber fears the loss of home advantage could prove critical – even without fans.
“The disadvantages of us not playing the league’s top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious,” Barber said.
“Clearly, we must accept there may also be some benefit from playing our remaining four away matches at neutral venues but the fixture list simply isn’t equally balanced at this stage of the season, and we didn’t play our first 29 matches of the season in this way. So, in our opinion one thing doesn’t cancel out the other.”
The PA news agency understands the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing – which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
Some reports had named the Amex as among the stadiums under consideration, but Barber said that was speculation at this stage.
“We haven’t been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches – by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police – and at this point we haven’t been approached to have such a discussion either so I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports,” he said.
West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady said that every Premier League club wants to complete the season but has warned there are “a lot of obstacles” to overcome.
“At yesterday’s meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart,” she wrote in her column for the Sun.
“We all know that it is going to take a lot of working together, good faith, careful thought and compromises if we have any chance of that happening.
“The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game…
“There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
Brady has detailed a four-phase strategy for a return to action, with the first one – isolated training sessions at training grounds – already under way.
Phase two would be a return to group training, phase three is the restart of domestic games, and the final phase would see a return to international matches.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Progress' - EFL reveal Championship development as Birmingham City set return date</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chairman Rick Parry has insisted that the EFL remain determined to finish the season in an open letter to all 71 clubs.
All professional matches in England have been suspended since mid-March and talks continue over when or whether the season will resume.
Both France and the Netherlands have cancelled the remaining matches in their top-flight but Parry insists the EFL will not follow suit and remain in constant dialogue with the government.
An open letter read: “Whilst there is still no further clarity on a return of EFL matches, the objective remains to play the remaining fixtures for the 2019-20 campaign at the current 71 EFL grounds.
"It is important that any clubs notify the EFL of any issues that may prevent this as soon as possible.
"Some progress has been made in respect of planning how matches may take place, with draft operational plans put before the board at this week’s meeting and incorporating many areas such as: stadium preparation, medical provisions, staffing, media access and, of course, measures needed to ensure the safety of all participants including first-team players and staff, match officials, and everyone else associated with the matchday environment.”
The Premier League remain in talks over ‘Project Restart’ with a date of June 8 targeted for a potential return to action.
Blues are currently 16th in the table, eight points off the bottom three - and nine off the play-offs.
Pep Clotet has revealed Birmingham City’s training plans in the event their Championship season can be resumed.
The EFL have sent an open letter to their clubs this week restating their desire to complete the current campaign.
Chief executive Rick Parry told clubs: “Whilst there is still no further clarity on a return of EFL matches, the objective remains to play the remaining fixtures for the 2019-20 campaign at the current 71 EFL grounds.”
And with that still the aim Blues have laid out their roadmap for a return to training.
“We are following the government guidelines and we have prepared it so that the players can have individual, optional work if they want to go to the training ground on their own. They have received that on the phone and video,” Clotet told the club's YouTube channel.
“They can do that from next week.
“Based on the information we have at the minute the plan that we have is so that we can start training the week after – mid-May
“But of course a lot of things need to happen, we need to know what are the plans of all the clubs and EFL to make sure the environments are safe, if it is going to be tested or not tested.
“There are some many things in the air but we are planning to try to be on the pitch on May 18. Some testing before - then on the 18 we can start training."
Ben Foster has revealed the bizarre one-word team talk Carson Yeung gave Birmingham City's players as they fought relegation in 2011.
Alex McLeish's side defeated Arsenal in the League Cup final at Wembley before being relegated from the Premier League to cap a turbulent season.
McLeish would later quit the club for arch-rivals Aston Villa and Yeung's tenure as owner began to unravel.
He was eventually imprisoned for money laundering and sold the club to current owners Trillion Trophy Asia in October 2016.
And Foster, who spent just one season at St Andrew's after joining from Manchester United, has detailed a bizarre meeting with Yeung towards the end of the 2010/11 campaign.
Speaking to The Peter Crouch Podcast, Foster said: "That was the season we won the League Cup against Arsenal. That was one of my best moments in football, it was great.
"We had Carson Yeung - do you remember that guy? He only ever came into the stadium a few times to see the lads, but his English was zero, he couldn't say a thing, honestly.
"It was about two or three games before the end of the season and we're in trouble and facing relegation.
"And they've gone, 'The owner wants to come in and say a few words before the match to boost morale'.
"Anyway, he walks in and you can see he's nervous. It's all quiet and it's so weird. He doesn't say anything and everyone is thinking, 'What is going on?'
"And eventually he just blurts out 'Win!' - and that's all he said. 'Win', and then he just stops and walks out.
"That was genuinely all he could muster, 'Win'."
There are themes which run through Jonathan Spector’s career in English football, like writing through a stick of Blackpool rock.
So often the affable American found himself stuck between that rock and a hard place, with relegation battles, injury struggles and managerial changes making sure life was never straight forward.
Whether it was in the Claret of West Ham, or the Blue of Birmingham City, the defender ducked and dived the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune for more than a decade.
He amassed more than 300 Football League appearances, mounted two European campaigns and dodged the drop on a couple of occasions before returning to his homeland for a quieter life.
It is one that finds now finds him as the Head of International Player recruitment at Atlanta United and a 34-year-old for whom the upheaval of Upton Park and St Andrew’s must seem to belong to a different lifetime.
Upheaval was the one constant.
“I feel my time in England, the five years at West Ham and five-and-a-half at Birmingham there was always some sort of existential crisis or something in the club that became an issue,” he told BirminghamLive.
Coincidentally Spector made his debuts for both the Hammers and Blues in European competition. He also worked under Gianfranco Zola at both clubs.
His West Ham bow came when Alan Pardew’s team lost 3-0 to Palermo in the UEFA Cup in August 2006.
For Blues it was five years later as part of Chris Hughton’s Europa League adventurers in a 0-0 draw with Nacional on the island of Madeira.
If the game didn’t live long in the memory, the journey to an imposing cliff-face citadel certainly did.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Project Restart' Latest: Neutral Venues, Championship Playoffs, Player and Club Unrest & More</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While a selection of leagues around Europe have opted to wrap up proceedings and not complete their seasons due to the coronavirus pandemic, this is not the intention of the Premier League.
All 20 top flight clubs met on Friday to discuss the logistics of resuming the season in what has been branded 'Project Restart'.
No decisions were formally taken at the meeting, but the return of football has received the backing of Oliver Dowden, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.
Let's take a look at the latest developments.
The Mirror reports that 'Project Restart' proposes that clubs' remaining nine to 10 games will be played at neutral, approved top flight stadiums.
These will likely include Brighton's AmEx, St Mary's in Southampton, and West Ham's and Manchester City's homes - as these are all modern grounds and located outside of the city centre.
This would mean that league leaders Liverpool would not lift their long awaited maiden Premier League title at Anfield.
The games will be played behind closed doors, with a maximum of 300 people at each ground. This will mainly be players, staff, security and media.
The reports say that while there is no fixed return date, as things stand, the week of 6 June – 13 June has been suggested to resume games.
'Project Restart' has not been received harmoniously.
According to the Mirror, there is a friction between the top six sides and the rest of the Premier League.
The report states that Premier League's elite are 'in danger of destroying football's integrity' by pushing to finish the season during a devastating global pandemic.
Relegation threatened sides are against the suggestion of using neutral venues to complete the season, as every club would lose home advantage.
According to journalist Jonathan Veal, Brighton are 'adamant' that they want to keep their remaining five home games.
The Seagulls sit two points clear of the relegation zone, but five of their remaining nine fixtures were scheduled to be at home. Four of those were against Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool...
If the season cannot be completed in full, The Guardian reports that Football League's preferred conclusion would be to promote Leeds and West Brom - who are currently seven and six points clear in the Championship promotion places with nine games remaining - and play the playoffs to determine the final promotion spot.
The playoffs would consists of current top six sides Fulham, Brentford, Nottingham Forest and Preston. These would be one legged ties staged behind closed doors at neutral venues.
Swansea, Blackburn, Cardiff, Millwall and Bristol City are all within three points or less of the top six, but would miss out under these circumstances.
Promotion from the Championship hinges on the Premier League season being completed and sides being relegated from the top flight.
According to the Mirror, if the season is curtailed, promoting just Leeds and West Brom and playing with an extended 22-team Premier League remains a possibility.
Clubs were presented with a medical report stating training guidelines and requirements should football resume.
This included wearing face masks in training, sterilising footballs and testing twice a week.
However, according to the Mirror, Premier League players were not aware of this until they saw the news in the papers on Thursday.
Players were said to be 'shocked' and 'bemused' that they had not been consulted, while chief executives, club owners and chairmen had.
Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte admits that although he wants to play football again as soon as possible, the decision should be left in the hands of the health experts.
Speaking to Sky Sports, Laporte said: "The news soon could be good, but the most important thing is health.
"We are waiting for news on what the experts say about that, and this is the most important thing. They are the best at doing this job, and they will try to make the best decision for everyone."I'm missing football a lot - I want to play and train, and I think it's the first time in my life I have not played for this length of time. Hopefully, soon we'll be back on the pitch and in the Champions League too."
The Mirror reports that a vote could take place on Friday - the day after the government announce their lockdown update.
It will require 14 clubs to vote in favour of 'Project Restart' for the plans to go ahead, which could be a struggle given the opposition from those outside the top six.
The best case scenario would involve players returning to training from 18 May, and the first game kicking off on 12 June.
All games could be completed within a six-week period, but no exact date has been set.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Brighton chief refutes reports of using Amex Stadium as a neutral ground</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brighton and Hove Albion's deputy chairman Paul Barber says the club have not been approached to use the Amex Stadium as a neutral ground in the event of a Premier League restart.
Reports have suggested one option being considered by the Premier League, should the competition be allowed to resume amid the coronavirus crisis, is to hold all matches behind closed doors at neutral venues.
The Amex is rumoured to be one of the grounds under consideration, yet Barber has suggested the reports are, as it stands, wide of the mark.
"We haven't been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches – by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police – and at this point we haven't been approached to have such a discussion either so I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports," Barber wrote in a statement on the club's official website.
"Some newspapers reported that the use of a small number of neutral venues may be the only way to complete the Premier League season to ensure social distancing policies are maintained, and Albion was named as one of a number of clubs against such a move."
Barber also added that Brighton – who were battling relegation prior to the suspension of the season – would not be satisfied with switching matches to neutral stadiums.
"We do of course understand that in the very difficult circumstances we are facing that every option must be considered – but that should only be when safe to do so for all concerned and, if and when we reach that point, we are not in favour of playing our remaining matches at neutral venues," he wrote.
"Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.
"But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition.
"Five of our nine remaining matches due to be played at the Amex – all five matches are very difficult but four are against some of the biggest clubs in European football."
Brighton were set to welcome Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City to the Amex in their next four home matches.

    <h5 class="mb-1">EPL clubs told neutral venues essential to plans to complete season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Premier League clubs have been told the remaining matches of the 2019/20 season must be played at neutral venues, the PA news agency understands.
QUIZ | Do you know which EPL clubs call these stadiums home?
The clubs were presented with the league's 'Project Restart' plans at a meeting on Friday, and while a statement was issued reconfirming the clubs' commitment to finishing the season, it is understood there is no possibility that it can now finish on a home-and-away basis for safety reasons.
The restart plans were understood to have been well received, but there remains opposition on competition and integrity grounds about the idea of finishing the season at neutral venues.
PA understands the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing - which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
It is also understood the EFL is still intent on playing the remainder of its campaigns behind closed doors at the regular venues, but the governing body is aware current plans may need to change.
Clubs are expected to vote on the key principles of 'Project Restart' some time after 7 May, when the Government must review the current UK lockdown.
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said on Thursday that the idea of not playing matches home and away was a "further imperfection" on top of games being behind closed doors.
The UK national football policing lead, Deputy Chief Constable Mark Roberts of South Yorkshire Police, told the PA news agency on Wednesday that playing all matches in the Premier League and EFL at their original venues would "present challenges" for the emergency services at a time when they are already stretched.
It is understood there were still no discussions around declaring the season null and void or curtailing it, with France and Holland having been forced to end their competitions because of government orders.
The league is working with the Government on the restart plans and the first meeting took place on Friday between medical officials from sports governing bodies, including the Premier League's Mark Gillett, and representatives from Public Health England.
Return-to-training protocols, which include wearing face masks or snoods, were presented to clubs. Teams will consult with playing and management staff on the proposals, which are still subject to approval.
Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero is among players who have expressed their concerns about returning to action in the midst of the pandemic.
It is understood the league is still working towards a best-case scenario of play being able to resume from the week beginning June 8.
The Bundesliga is in line to start before then, with German clubs returning to training in recent weeks ahead of a potential mid-May start.
But the challenge of resuming matches during the pandemic was highlighted by Cologne, who confirmed on Friday that three people at the club had contracted Covid-19. Despite that, the club say "group training can continue".
As well as returning to play, further discussions will also be required on the subject of player status, particularly around temporary contract extensions for individuals whose deals expire on June 30 and those, such as Hakim Ziyech, whose registration starts on 1 July. Ziyech will join Chelsea from Ajax, who play in a league which has already been forced to end.
A statement from the Premier League on Friday afternoon read: "The league and clubs are considering the first tentative moves forward and will only return to training and playing with Government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers. The league welcomed the creation of the Government medical working group for a return of elite sport, which met for the first time this morning.
"No decisions were taken at today's shareholders' meeting and clubs exchanged views on the information provided regarding Project Restart. It was agreed that the PFA, LMA, players and managers are key to this process and will be further consulted.
"The clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019/20 season, maintaining integrity of the competition and welcomed the Government's support."
The Premier League also confirmed that shareholders "unanimously agreed to curtail the 2019/20 Academy Games Programme" to give staff and players clarity.
The decision is "independent of any discussions regarding the resumption of the 2019/20 campaign for first-team football" and means the curtailment of all under-9 to under-16 matches, as well as the under-18 and under-23 competitions.
Final league standings and outcomes for the season will be decided at a future date.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Everton headlines as Blues linked with the 'new Gabriel Jesus'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Here are your Everton morning headlines for Saturday, May 2.
Premier League set to complete 2019/20 season
The Premier League has confirmed there are no immediate changes to plans to complete the 2019/20 campaign after meeting with all 20 clubs.
Football in England has been suspended indefinitely since mid-March and there have been fears the season will not be completed.
With nine matches of the season still to play, Everton remain in the bottom half of the standings but a European finish is not out of the question - they sit just six points from a Europa League spot.
“At a meeting of Premier League Shareholders today, clubs discussed possible steps towards planning to resume the 2019/20 season, when it is safe and appropriate to do so,” a Premier League statement said yesterday.
“Furthermore, the Premier League’s priority is the health and safety of players, coaches, managers, club staff, supporters and the wider community.
“The clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019/20 season, maintaining integrity of the competition and welcomed the Government’s support.”
Another meeting is scheduled for Friday, May 8th, with hopes of a return to training in mid-May ahead of a June 8 restart.
Everton linked to Palmeiras star Gabriel Veron
Everton and Arsenal are both reportedly in the hunt for Palmeiras striker Gabriel Veron, with club president Mauricio Galiotte comparing him to Gabriel Jesus.
Jesus hit 28 goals across two seasons at the club before joining Manchester City in January 2017 in a landmark £27m deal.
“Veron will follow the story of Gabriel Jesus here, we have no doubt of that. We hope he stays at Palmeiras for a long time,” Galiotte said of Veron.
The report claims Everton were rebuffed with a £12m approach for the player, with Galiotte adding: "We were contacted a few times, but Palmeiras does not want to get rid of the player. He is a very talented, distinguished athlete.”
1994 World Cup winning striker Bebeto has said of Veron (named after former Argentine midfielder maestro Juan Sebastian): "He’s a kid with enormous talent. I looked for more information about him and I was impressed once I saw him wearing the No.7 producing beautiful plays.”
Four years since Martinez tipping point
On 30 April 2016, Everton recorded a 2-1 home win over Bournemouth - but it would not be enough to save boss Roberto Martinez.
A 4-0 league loss at Anfield coupled with an FA Cup semi-final defeat to Manchester United had turned the tide against the Spaniard, with a banner flown over the stadium requesting that he leave alongside chants from the stands.
It presented Farhad Moshiri's biggest test of his early reign at the club and the decision taken is arguably his most significant yet.
After Martinez’s departure, Ronald Koeman came and - despite a promising first season - things fell apart in 2017/18, while Sam Allardyce was never likely to be a permanent solution.
Marco Silva, like Koeman, showed plenty of promise before the situation once again unravelled.
Carlo Ancelotti is now at the helm and the Italian is hugely respected inside and outside the club. He could be the individual with all the qualities that Moshiri so longed for when he took over the club.

The Premier League are clear they want to complete the season on the field when the pandemic allows them to complete it. The aim is to resume on 12th June.
The clubs in the English top flight agree that the campaign could be finished at neutral grounds to prevent supporters from gathering outside. 
'Sky Sports' have revealed a list of stadia which could host games including Wembley and Twickenham, the home of England's rugby team.
St George's Park, the London Stadium, Brighton's AMEX Stadium and the Etihad are others mentioned,
'The Guardian' said that the majority of the grounds the Government and the clubs are proposing are Premier League grounds.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Liverpool's telling approach to Premier League 'Project Restart' meetings</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Liverpool are reportedly taking a back seat in the current meetings to determine what will happen to the 2019/20 Premier League season.
Talks between the 20 clubs are ongoing as the division seeks to find a way to resume amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis.
There is said to be a will to finish the current season across almost all clubs, but the prospect of playing all of the remaining matches behind closed doors at neutral venues is said to be causing some concern among clubs who aren't keen on the idea.
Teams near the bottom of the table are not thought to be too enthusiastic about the idea of forfeiting home advantage for a number of crucial games, even though there would be no fans present.
But with the Premier League stating that the neutral venue option - with matches played at around 8-10 stadia - would be the only way to get the season finished and protect valuable TV revenues, a vote will take place on the plan next week.
For Liverpool, the current suspension of football has left the club waiting to see if they would be afforded the opportunity to seal a much longed-for league title, a first in 30 years.
With any prospect of the season being declared "null and void" never really gaining any traction, the options before the league would either see the season played out - with Liverpool needing at most two wins from nine games to be champions - or curtailed and the final standings determined via a points per game system.
Liverpool would be keen on the season being played out, and have joined their other top six clubs in pushing for that scenario, but a report from The Athletic - which adds that Arsenal and Aston Villa are said to be very keen to play - claims that the Reds have stopped talking in the current meetings, and maintain a "Sphinx-like cool" over whatever will happen.
Should the season be curtailed then the likelihood is that Liverpool would be named champions, just as Paris Saint-Germain were in France.
PSG were 12 points clear with a game in hand when Ligue 1 was halted, while Liverpool sit 25 points clear of second-placed Manchester City.
So the Reds are perhaps safe in the knowledge that they will be champions anyway, but would like to complete the job on the pitch.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League cancels season for U23s and below – report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Premier League and EFL have taken the step to cancel the 2019/20 season for U23s and all levels below, including the academies.
The decision was made public following a meeting on Friday, but there is yet to be confirmation on how the final standings will be decided.
With senior football in the country taking priority during the coronavirus pandemic, efforts will be made to sort out the Premier League before anything else.
Prior to the season being postponed, Barry Lewtas’ Liverpool U18s side were second place, 12 points behind Manchester City, whereas the U23s were fifth on 26 points.
The Premier League have reiterated their wish to complete the 2019/20 season, in a new statement released after the meeting on Friday.
There is still no definitive date for the game to get back underway, but Liverpool do stay on track to win the title eventually.
The Reds still sit 25 points clear at the top of the table, as we patiently await for the situation in the UK to become prudent enough for the Premier League to take action.
As has seemed to be the case for some time now, it’s appears to be a case of ‘when’ and not ‘if’ the season will resume.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reports | Premier League told neutral venues only way to finish 2019/20 season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While the Ligue 1, the Eredivisie and the Jupiler Pro League have already called an end to their league seasons, few others are looking to do the same. The Serie A does have a plan to do just that but it’s as a last resort with the Italian top tier looking to restart their season. The same applies to the Bundesliga with them planning for a May 9th restart unless things change.
However, the future of the 2019/20 Premier League season has been in flux with the league struggling to come to an agreement. But with the league overly keen on a restart, the BBC has reported that clubs have been informed that neutral venues are the only way to complete the season. The report further indicates that up to ten stadiums will be used to resume the season with the Premier League looking to get up to 40,000 tests for players and other staff. However, while many other leagues have returned to training, the BBC reported that the Premier League would only do so after government guidance.
"No decisions were taken at today's meeting and clubs exchanged views on the information provided regarding 'Project Restart'. It was agreed that the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), the League Managers' Association (LMA), players and managers are key to this process and will be further consulted," the statement added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What Cardiff City, Swansea City, Leeds United and West Brom will have learned from Rick Parry’s open letter to EFL clubs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The EFL have once again reaffirmed their stance that they are aiming to complete the 2019/20 season when it is deemed safe to do so.
Chairman Ricky Parry has insisted that the EFL remain determined to finish the season in an open letter to all 71 clubs.
All professional football in England has been indefinitely suspended since March 13 and there is no concrete date as to when it will return.
Reports earlier this week had suggested there was a growing feeling that the EFL season was unlikely to be completed, while a leaked message from Bristol Rovers' PFA representative Alex Rodman suggested plans to promote three teams from each level of the EFL, with no relegation, were now gathering pace.
However, it seems that football chiefs remain keen on ensuring that the season is allowed to be completed.
Like the rest of the EFL, Cardiff City and Swansea City would have ended their regular seasons this weekend, and were both firmly in the running for a top six finish.
Failure to complete the season would, in all likelihood, end any possible hope of either side earning a place in the top flight next season.
However, this latest assurance will come as a significant boost to their respective ambitions, although clearly there is still plenty of uncertainty over the situation.
What did Parry say?
"Whilst there is still no further clarity on a return of EFL matches, the objective remains to play the remaining fixtures for the 2019-20 campaign at the current 71 EFL grounds.
“It is important that any clubs notify the EFL of any issues that may prevent this as soon as possible.
"Some progress has been made in respect of planning how matches may take place, with draft operational plans put before the board at this week's meeting and incorporating many areas such as: stadium preparation, medical provisions, staffing, media access and, of course, measures needed to ensure the safety of all participants including first-team players and staff, match officials, and everyone else associated with the matchday environment."
When will they next meet?
It is not yet known when the EFL and its club are set to meet again, however given the Premier League is due to meet next Friday, one imagines an update from the governing body will be issued next week.
While the government is also expected to issue a statement on lockdown measures next Thursday.
Should measures be loosened, it will offer encouragement that clubs can return to training in mid-May ahead of a June 8 restart.
Of course, if current measures remain, that would seriously dent any hopes of restarting on that date.
What are the national media saying?
According to the Guardian, the EFL have put a contingency plan in place if the 2019/20 Championship season isn't completed.
The plan will see Leeds United and West Brom promoted with the play-offs used to decide the final spot.
Leeds and West Brom have a clear advantage in the automatic promotion places, making it relatively straightforward to award them a place in the Premier League if the season can't be completed.
However, with only four points between Fulham, Nottingham Forest and Brentford who make up third to fifth spot, the EFL reportedly plans to play out the usual play-off lottery to determine the third promoted team.
The Championship intends to complete the season but as its clubs wait to be informed on how protocols for behind-closed-doors matches would work, the EFL have set out a plan of action for a worst-case scenario.
Meanwhile, the Daily Mail claim Championship clubs are set to discuss introducing a salary cap from next season.
The cap would limit any new contract to £7,000 per week and would see clubs attempting to renegotiate existing deals.
The number would be a big drop for many clubs with the average highest earner in the Championship earning £29,000 per week.
Currently, the highest-paid player in the second tier earns a whopping £68,000 per week.
The average lowest-paid player earns £8,500, which puts into perspective the level of the cut being discussed.
The measures wouldn't end there, either, with proposals for each squad to be limited to 24 with a certain number of 23-and-unders.
According to the report, the EFL also wants the next transfer window to remain open until the end of March to allow clubs to rebalance their books.
"It's common sense," one EFL club official told SportsMail. "Extending the window would allow us flexibility as we try to keep afloat."
Beyond the Championship, it is being reported that players are being told the chances of resuming the current season are 'receding'.
Across all leagues, it is unlikely fans will return to stadiums until at least January.
The EFL declined to comment when asked about the story, but clubs are set to meet today to discuss plans both for the current season and the future.
What else has been happening?
Bradford City have dropped a huge hint that next season will commence behind closed doors.
The League Two side have this afternoon suspended all season-ticket sales as they await further information regarding a conclusion to the current campaign.
“'City For All' 2020/21 season-ticket sales have today been suspended,” a statement on the club’s website read.
“The decision has been taken as the club continues to await further information regarding a conclusion to the current campaign, with the start date for next season yet to be confirmed.
“This comes following a meeting yesterday held between the EFL and the Bantams' Sky Bet League Two colleagues.
“City officials have recently been informed of the ever-growing possibility of supporters being unable to attend matches until 2021.
“And it is now highly likely that next season will commence behind closed doors.
“Should this be the case, the club will endeavour to ensure those who have already purchased season tickets for the coming campaign will be able to view matches - FREE of charge - from home via iFollow.
“If this is not preferred then refunds will become available at a later date.
“The club will move to update supporters on this matter as soon as possible, with talks to continue over the coming weeks between the relevant governing bodies.”
While the EFL have also confirmed that all academy matches for the 2019/20 season have been cancelled.
The decision has been made that all Under-23, Under-18 and other competitions will not take place as the sole focus remains on completing first-team matches.
An EFL statement on Friday read: "The EFL has today confirmed that the Academy Games Programme for the 2019/20 season has been terminated with immediate effect.
"The EFL administers the programme for Category 3 and 4 Clubs (U9 to U18) whilst the Premier League does so for Category 1 and 2 Clubs (U9 to U23) and the decision, which is independent of any discussions regarding the resumption of the 2019/20 campaign for first-team football, has been taken to give Academy staff and their players an element of clarity at this challenging time.
"The methodology for determining the final League standings or other outcomes for the season will be decided at a future date. Additionally, it is intended that any fixtures for the 2020/21 Academy season will not commence any earlier than would usually be expected.
"In addition, several other games programmes have been affected.”
Those competitions affected are the Central League, the Community & Education Football Alliance (CEFA) and the Kids Cup.
What have the Premier League said?
“At a meeting of Premier League Shareholders today, clubs discussed possible steps towards planning to resume the 2019/20 season, when it is safe and appropriate to do so,” a Premier League statement said.
“It was reiterated that the thoughts of all are with those directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Furthermore, the Premier League’s priority is the health and safety of players, coaches, managers, club staff, supporters and the wider community.
“The League and clubs are considering the first tentative moves forward and will only return to training and playing with Government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers.
“The League welcomed the creation of the Government medical working group for a return of elite sport, which met for the first time this morning.
“No decisions were taken at today’s Shareholders’ meeting and clubs exchanged views on the information provided regarding "Project Restart".
“It was agreed that the PFA, LMA, players and managers are key to this process and will be further consulted.
“The clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019/20 season, maintaining integrity of the competition and welcomed the Government’s support.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">What EFL plans mean for Pride Park and latest on centre-back's transfer to Derby County</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Derby County are still on course to play their remaining Championship games with EFL chairman Rick Parry writing an open letter to all 71 clubs insisting there is a determination to finish the season.
All professional matches in England have been suspended since mid-March and talks continue over when or whether the season will resume, with Derby sat 12th, five points off the play-off spots, with nine games to play.
Both France and the Netherlands have cancelled the remaining matches in their top flight but Parry insists the EFL will not follow suit and remain in constant dialogue with the government.
He also appeared to rule out the notion of neutral venues for fixtures, an idea that has been mooted in the Premier League.
An open letter read: "Whilst there is still no further clarity on a return of EFL matches, the objective remains to play the remaining fixtures for the 2019-20 campaign at the current 71 EFL grounds. It is important that any clubs notify the EFL of any issues that may prevent this as soon as possible."

Mike Te Wierik will join Derby County as planned this summer despite the crisis in football due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The COVID-19 outbreak has halted the game around the world and it remains unclear when football will restart.
Te Wierik has signed a pre-contract agreement to link up with the Rams on a free transfer from Dutch club Groningen this summer.
The Eredivisie season was cancelled last week with no promotion or relegation and no champions.
Ajax led the table from AZ Alkmaar on goal difference with nine games left but will not be named champions.

Derby County are ready to go with their training plans should the Government say it is safe for football to do so.
The Championship campaign is currently suspended indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The Rams ' last match was the 3-0 victory over Blackburn Rovers on March 8, almost two months ago.
The EFL’s training resumption is pencilled in for May 16, but that very much depends on being given the green light and the Government easing lockdown restrictions on May 7.
Derby's players have been training at home, but the club has been putting together contingency plans for when a return to the Moor Farm training complex is possible.

Derby County Under-23s will not get a shot at silverware after the Premier League cancelled all youth football.
The young Rams had made it through to the quarter-finals of the Premier League Cup after a 6-0 demolition of Middlesbrough in March, but they will not get to see the campaign through following a “unanimous” decision on Friday.
The cancellation of academy football also sees Derby Under-23s’ Premier League 2 campaign ended. For a good portion of the season, they had looked like title contenders, but a run of five games without a win saw them slip to fourth with four games to play, 11 points behind leaders Chelsea.
No decision has yet been made on how the final standings will be determined, and whether a title will be awarded and relegation enforced, but if the Premier League choose to take the points-per-game route, Derby will finish fifth.
The Premier League’s decision also sees the Under-18s’ Premier League North campaign ended. Retaining the title was all-but off the cards for the Under-18s, who, like the Under-23s, could drop from fourth to fifth if the season is decided by points per game.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ronald Koeman in hospital after undergoing heart procedure</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holland manager Ronald Koeman has undergone a heart procedure in Amsterdam after experiencing chest pain and is due to return home on Monday.
The 57-year-old, who managed Southampton and Everton in the Premier League before taking over his country almost two years ago, was taken to hospital on Sunday evening where he underwent cardiac catheterisation.
That involves the placement of a long, thin tube into a vein or artery and is typically performed without general anaesthetic.
A statement from the Dutch football association, the KNVB, read: ‘Ronald Koeman was hospitalised on Sunday evening after chest complaints. The 57-year-old national team coach of the Dutch national team has undergone a successful cardiac catheterisation and will return home tomorrow.
‘We wish Ronald a lot of strength and improvement.’
A tweet from the governing body’s account added: ‘That is a shock. Fortunately things are going better again.’
‘Everton posted a message of support for the former Barcelona defender, tweeting: “Everyone at EFC would like to wish former boss @RonaldKoeman a speedy recovery.’
France midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, who played under Koeman for both the Toffees and the Saints was also quick to react.
‘Prayers are with you! Stay strong @RonaldKoeman,’ he wrote, while Holland and Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum also added on Twitter: ‘Wishing you soon recovery coach.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Everton boss Ronald Koeman hospitalised after heart attack</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ronald Koeman is recovering in hospital after suffering a heart attack.
The former Southampton and Everton boss fell ill at his home in Bussum, a town 20 miles outside Amsterdam, this afternoon.
He was rushed to hospital in the Dutch capital by ambulance at 3.45pm where he underwent an angiogram that confirmed the doctors' initial diagnosis.
Koeman, 57, is being treated at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre and his condition is not thought to be life-threatening.
The Dutchman, who had a glittering playing career with Groningen, Ajax, PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona and Feyenoord, is famous for his cool demeanour on the touchline.
He told Dutch media a few days ago that he was taking regular bike rides to maintain his fitness during the coronavirus lockdown.
The former defender started his coaching career on the staff of the Dutch national team in 1997 before returning to the Nou Camp the following year as assistant boss to Louis van Gaal.
He became manager of Vitesse in 2000 and also had spells in charge ofmAjax, Benfica, PSV, Valencia, AZ Alkmaar and Feyenoord before arriving in the Premier League with Southampton as Mauricio Pochettino's successor in 2014.
He guided the Saints to seventh in his first season - and then went one better the following year when the south coast club qualified for Europe with their highest-ever Premier League with a sixth-placed finish.
His one full season at Goodison Park saw Everton also qualify for the Europa League.
But he was sacked in October 2017 when he failed to deliver on a £150million transfer spend.
Koeman became Holland boss six months later.
He led them to last year's inaugural Nations League, beating England in the semi-finals before losing to hosts Portugal.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dutch national coach Ronald Koeman required hospital treatment after suffering a heart problem, his wife told De Telegraaf newspaper on Sunday.
The 57-year-old underwent a "cardiac catheterisation" procedure at a hospital in Amsterdam after complaining of feeling unwell at his home.
"The speed with which he was taken to the hospital and the quick intervention of the doctors allowed his condition to be stabilised," said Bartina Koeman.
Koeman, who has coached the Dutch side since 2018, is expected to be discharged from hospital on Monday.
"It was a shock," tweeted the Dutch football federation.
"Happily, things are already a little better. Strength and a good recovery, coach."
Koeman, a standout defender at Ajax, PSV, Feyenoord and Barcelona as well as the Dutch team in his playing career, had already qualified the Netherlands for Euro 2020.
However, the tournament has been pushed back to 2021 due to the coronavirus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman suffers heart attack</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ronald Koeman is recovering after he was rushed to hospital with heart problems.
Koeman, who is currently the manager of the Netherlands, underwent cardiac catheterization and is now believed to be recovering.
He was rushed to hospital by ambulance from his home town though doctors have now said that the former Barcelona star is stable.
Koeman had to have a stent placed in his vein as his coronary artery was blocked but there has been no suggestion his heart problem was coronavirus related.
Koeman had told Dutch media recently that he was taking regular bike rides to maintain his fitness during the coronavirus lockdown.
The 57-year-old is being treated at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre and his condition is not thought to be life-threatening.
The former Southampton and Everton boss had fallen ill at his home in Bussum, a town 20 miles outside Amsterdam, this afternoon.
Koeman took charge of the Netherlands in 2018 and led the country to the final of the inaugural Nations League last summer.
He had gone into management after a glittering playing career where he had turned out for the likes of Ajax and PSV Eindhoven as well as Barcelona.
His managing career has seen him take charge of European giants Benfica and Valencia as well as a spell in the Premier League with Everton and the Saints.
He is expected to return home on Monday following his procedure with Koeman having been planning for this summer’s Euro 2020.
That tournament has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic and is now set to be played in the summer of 2021.
Koeman has helped Netherlands become one of the giants of world football again with the nation having missed out on the 2018 World Cup.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holland manager Ronald Koeman rushed to hospital with heart problem and has stent inserted after emergency operation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HOLLAND manager Ronald Koeman has been rushed to an Amsterdam hospital for an emergency heart operation.
The former Everton and Southampton boss had a stent inserted into his coronary vein after scans showed it was blocked.
Koeman's wife Bertina and his agent, Rob Jansen, confirmed to Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that the 57-year-old is in a stable condition.
The Ajax, PSV and Barcelona legend had to have a stent (a tube that keeps the blood vessel open) inserted after a cardiac catheterisation showed the vein was blocked.
He had been out cycling before complaining of chest pain - he was then taken in an ambulance to Amsterdam UMC hospital.
He is expected to be able to return home on Monday and there has been no suggestion so far that his heart problem was related to the coronavirus.
Koeman, who won eight league titles, two European Cups and Euro 88 as a player, was preparing his Netherlands side for Euro 2020 this summer before the Covid-19 crisis forced the tournament to be postponed a year.
All international matches have since been scrapped, with league across Europe awaiting the fait of their current campaigns.
The Dutch season was cancelled at the end of April, with the French league soon following.
At the moment, the Premier League plan to resume the season on June 12 and stage matches behind closed doors at neutral grounds - if the Government gives the green light.
Premier League clubs agreed during their video conference on Friday on a target date of May 18 to return to full training, with match days following three weeks later.
Players are set to be tested for Covid-19 twice a week, meaning the Premier League are planning on finding - and funding - over 10,000 tests between the start of training and the end of the season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ronald Koeman: Holland manager hospitalised in Amsterdam with a heart problem</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Ronald Koeman has landed in hospital after suffering heart problems
- The 57-year-old underwent a cardiac catheterization
- Doctors have said he is now in stable condition
The current Holland manager was rushed to the hospital after he suffered heart problems on Sunday, May 3, according to latest reports by SunSport.
Koeman was immediately operated upon as he underwent cardiac catheterisation moments after he was rushed down via an ambulance.
Holland outlet Telegraaf claimed that the development was confirmed through the wife of the former Barcelona star, Bartina.

It was gathered that the ex-Southampton boss had a stent (a tube that keeps the blood vessel open) placed in the vein as his coronary artery was blocked.
Doctors who are attending to the case have reportedly confirmed his stability as they say he was rushed to the hospital on time.

There has been no suggestion his heart problem was coronavirus related.
Koeman was preparing his Holland side for Euro 2020 this summer before the coronavirus crisis forced the tournament to be postponed a year.
As a player, Koeman featured for Barcelona between 1989 and 1995 where he appeared in 192 games scoring 67 goals.
He returned to the Camp Nou in 1998 to work as the assistant coach before he left in year 2000.
Fans of the club recently named him among the top 20 player ever to have played for the Catalan giants.
Meanwhile, Blaise Matuidi has opened up about his unusual behaviour after testing positive to the deadly coronavirus.
The France international is one of three Juventus stars that have contracted the disease including Daniele Rugani and Paulo Dybala.
Though the midfielder has made full recovery, Matuidi disclosed that the sickness made him exhibit some unusual behaviour during the short period.

EPL and other top leagues across Europe were suspended as coronavirus crisis continue to ravage world economies, with more than 245,000 deaths across the globe.
Premier League chiefs are at crossroads as to decide what should be done to the league because the end of the pandemic is not in sight.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Netherlands Manager Ronald Koeman in Hospital With Heart Problems</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman is reported to have been admitted to hospital with heart problems.
The 57-year-old has been in charge of the Dutch national side, who he represented 78 times as a player, since 2018, after his departure from Everton.
Dutch outlet De Telegraaf report that he was rushed via ambulance to the Amsterdam Medical Centre on Sunday afternoon, with what appears to have been cardiac problems.
He is said to have undergone 'cardiac catheterization' in the care of doctors, but is believed to be in 'stable' condition for the time being.
De Telegraaf say that the swift assistance of doctors and paramedics have contributed to a slight improvement in his condition, but it remains a worrying time for Koeman and his wife Bartina.
The Dutch publication note that the improvement in Koeman's condition means that he could be released from hospital as soon as Monday, but that will depend on how things go over the next few hours.
Koeman was set to lead a strong Netherlands side out at Euro 2020, but the tournament has been postponed until 2021 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
An impressive qualifying campaign saw the Oranje lose just once - to Germany - and win six of their eight matches to storm to the finals, after disappointing in their failure to reach the 2018 World Cup.
Koeman is a celebrated figure in his native Holland, his tenure in the hotseat adding to a stellar playing career during which he marshalled a fearsome Dutch defence.
He helped Rinus Michels' famous side win the European Championships in 1988, and harboured hopes of repeating that success himself this summer before the Euros were postponed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Froome unsure if Tour can keep crowds away</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">English cyclist Chris Froome believes the Tour de France can work without spectators – but questioned how organisers can prevent large crowds converging along the course.
Initially due to start on June 27, the coronavirus pandemic has seen the Tour pushed back until August 29 and doubts remain given the differing COVID-19 situations across the world.
The French government says no mass gatherings can take place before September, but have clarified the Tour could still go ahead on its new dates if the opening stages are managed correctly.
That is one of the main things four-time champion Froome believes will be hard to manage as he continues to prepare for a tilt at another victory.
"For sure we can put the race on without people standing on the roads and fans in that sense," the Team Ineos rider said.
"I mean, we can put on the race and it can be broadcast on television.
"You're not going to get the same scenes as you would get going through these tunnels of just people everywhere and all the rest of it.
"Maybe that's the version of race we need to see this year. I don't know.
"In theory, we can put the race on but I think the bigger question is would the organisers be able to keep people from actually coming out and gathering in large crowds? I think that's the bigger question."
The 34-year-old missed last year's race after suffering career-threatening injuries in a crash.
And Froome has been hitting the gym first thing every day to try and replicate what he would be doing this time of the year in preparation for the Tour.
"Some days I'm even doing up to six hours sitting on the stationary trainer – big days," he told former cricketer Kevin Pietersen on an Instagram Live.
"It gets pretty boring at times. I've been through every playlist I own about 10 times each.
"But, yeah, just getting through it and doing the best I can."

"I mean, we can put on the race and it can be broadcast on television.
"You're not going to get the same scenes as you would get going through these tunnels of just people everywhere and all the rest of it.
"Maybe that's the version of race we need to see this year. I don't know.
"In theory, we can put the race on but I think the bigger question is would the organisers be able to keep people from actually coming out and gathering in large crowds? I think that's the bigger question."
Froome, 34, missed last year's Tour de France after suffering serious injuries in a crash.
He has been hitting the gym every day during lockdown to try and replicate what he would be doing this time of the year in preparation for the Tour.
"Some days I'm even doing up to six hours sitting on the stationary trainer - big days," he said.
"Obviously I'm coming off the back of a big injury now as well.
"A lot of the training I've been doing up until this point has been indoors already, so it's almost prepared me in a way for this whole lockdown period."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Froome fears Tour de France may struggle to keep fans away</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: Chris Froome fears Tour de France organisers could struggle to prevent fans gathering to watch the race even if it is not open to the public because of the coronavirus.
The Tour de France has been rescheduled for August 29 from its original June 27 start date, but there are still concerns about how to organise the event amid the pandemic.
The French government says no mass gatherings can take place before September, but has clarified the Tour could still go ahead on its new dates if the opening stages are managed correctly.
However, Team Ineos rider Froome, a four-time Tour de France winner, believes it will be hard to control whether crowds turn up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ex-Michigan QB Shea Patterson signing with Kansas City Chiefs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3 (UPI) -- The Kansas City Chiefs reached an agreement with former Michigan quarterback Shea Patterson.
Patterson's agent, Bryan Ehrlich, announced the signing Sunday on social media. The Chiefs have yet to confirm the deal.
Michigan had 10 players selected in this year's NFL Draft, including first-round offensive lineman Cesar Ruiz, but Patterson went undrafted.
"He wasn't a crybaby, he's an NFL player, and you have to be tough to be an NFL quarterback," Ehrlich told the Detroit News. "He was wading through the process, I was wading through the process, and Shea stayed ready, making sure it was a good fit. It took a little bit longer, but now he's got a home."
Once the agreement is finalized, Patterson will join a quarterback room that includes 2018 NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes. The Chiefs previously added Jordan Ta'amu, who played for the XFL's St. Louis BattleHawks this spring, and veteran Chad Henne this off-season as potential backups to Mahomes.
Patterson served as the Wolverines' starting quarterback over the past two seasons. He threw for 3,061 yards, 23 touchdowns and eight interceptions last season.
In four seasons at Ole Miss and Michigan, Patterson recorded 8,800 passing yards, 68 touchdown passes and 27 interceptions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Veteran Cowboys Player Reacts To The Andy Dalton Signing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A veteran Dallas Cowboys player appears to be a fan of the team’s decision to sign free agent quarterback Andy Dalton.
Dalton, 32, was released by the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday. He didn’t take very long to make a decision on the free agent market.
The longtime Bengals starter has reportedly agreed to a one-year deal in Dallas. His contract is reportedly worth up to $7 million in 2020.
Gerald McCoy, a six-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman who signed with the Cowboys this offseason, is a big fan of the move. The former Oklahoma Sooners star took to Twitter to react to the signing.
“Red rifle!! Let’s get it!!” McCoy wrote.
McCoy and Dalton played at Oklahoma and TCU, respectively, at the same time. McCoy came into the league in 2010 and Dalton came into it in 2012. The two players likely know each other pretty well.
Dalton should provide the Cowboys with a nice veteran backup presence. That is something the team has not had in a couple of seasons.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is using the coronavirus lockdown to step up his return to fitness after an injury-plagued season.
Pogba had made just eight appearances for United this season before the health crisis forced the suspension of the Premier League in March.
The French World Cup winner hasn't played a single match in 2020 due to his persistent ankle problems.
His last appearance came in a Dec 26 win over Newcastle, but Pogba has been keeping fit during the virus break and hopes to be ready if the Premier League can return in the summer.
"I have a little home gym in my house," Pogba told United's website.
"I can do some training, some running, some bike, go outside and do some things with the ball. I am just keeping busy and keeping healthy.
"We have got to stay motivated, there is no other choice. It is a period and we don't know until when it will be like this, but I still have goals in my head and one day hopefully this (pandemic) will stop.
"And then we have to get back on the pitch, so we have to be ready.
"For myself, I have been out for a long time as well, so for me I just want to come back playing football."
Pogba, 27, has been in regular contact with his United team-mates during the lockdown as they follow the club's fitness regime from home.
Linked with a move away from fifth-placed United earlier this season, Pogba's presence would boost their bid for Champions League qualification if matches can be played again eventually.
"My advice first of all is to stay safe, stay at home and keep practising," Pogba said.
"There is always a way to work, you can work with anything you have at home, you can still do sit-ups, push-ups."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pogba aiming to hit the ground running when Premier League returns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is determined to hit the ground running when football’s coronavirus suspension ends.
A return to Premier League action in June is currently on the cards, ending what will have been a three-month absence of action for the English top flight.
For injured players like Pogba, the wait has been even longer. The 27-year-old has managed just eight appearances during an injury-hit season and has yet to feature in 2020 due to an ankle issue.
“I have a little home gym in my house,” Pogba, who is isolating in the north west, said.
“I can do some training, some running, some bike, go outside and do some things with the ball. I am just keeping busy and keeping healthy.
“We have got to stay motivated, there is no other choice. It is a period and we don’t know until when it will be like this, but I still have goals in my head and one day hopefully this (pandemic) will stop. And then we have to get back on the pitch, so we have to be ready.
“For myself, I have been out for a long time as well, so for me I just want to come back playing football.”
Pogba has been in regular contact with his team-mates during the lockdown as they continue to the put the work in amid this unusual backdrop.
“My advice first of all is to stay safe, stay at home and keep practising,” he told the club’s website.
“There is always a way to work, you can work with anything you have at home, you can still do sit-ups, push-ups.
“For abdominals and core work, you don’t need weights and stuff like that. You just need the work.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pole vault event held in competitors' backyards</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">French pole vaulter Renaud Lavillenie hardly treated this like a garden-variety competition.
It was for backyard bragging rights. So he raised his intensity.
Lavillenie and Mondo Duplantis of Sweden shared the gold medal Sunday during a men's pole vault competition held in their own yards. Advertised as the "Ultimate Garden Clash,'' it was a rare sporting event contested during the coronavirus pandemic.
Duplantis, a world record-holder, and Lavillenie, the 2012 Olympic champion, each cleared a height of 16 feet (4.9 meters) 36 times over a span of 30 minutes that was broadcast by World Athletics on its social media channels. Both had one miss. Sam Kendricks of the United States got the bronze by clearing the bar 26 times in a competition featuring three of the event's biggest names.
It just might have been a preview of the Tokyo Games, which have been postponed to 2021. Lavillenie certainly took his concentration to another level.
"It's crazy, but even doing this in my garden, I get the same feeling I'd get at a major championships," Lavillenie said. "It was very exciting, and I'm very happy to be a part of it.''
They tried to figure out a tiebreaker before electing to share the gold. Duplantis, 20, initially pushed for a three-minute playoffs format that was on the table, while Lavillenie, 33, nixed the plan. He was exhausted.
Lavillenie did vault over his 36th successful bar just ahead of Duplantis. The event was split into two 15-minute sessions with a short halftime.
"I will give you a rematch, Mondo,'' he playfully said at the end.
The backyard idea was brought forth by Lavillenie, and the trio collaborated on the unique competition format because adjusting the bar wasn't practical without officials in place.
Duplantis competed from his base in Lafayette, Louisiana, with his setup next to a garden wall. Kendricks was at his farm in Oxford, Mississippi, with his landing mat nestled between trees and near a fence where a horse occasionally was caught on the video feed.
Then there was Lavillenie, who took part from Clermont-Ferrand, France. The family's trampoline was pushed to the side and there was a swingset in the background.
Don't expect this to be a new pole-vaulting format, though. This was only for show.
"I want to jump high,'' said Duplantis, the American-born vaulter who represents Sweden and broke Lavillenie's world record in February. "I want to jump a little higher.''
Still, it made for entertaining theater.
"The general sense of this competition was just supposed to be fun,'' said Kendricks, the two-time world champion. "A way to eat up time on a Sunday and give a chance for everybody to watch.''
Among those watching was World Athletics president Sebastian Coe, who gave the competition high marks.
"This is a brilliant initiative, great fun and really innovative,'' Coe said in a statement. "My thanks go to them, their families and the World Athletics team for bringing live athletics back during lockdown. I hope we can bring a few more events like this to bring to all athletics fans out there.''
It's already a hit among those in the track and field community.
"I love this idea so much,'' 200-meter world champion sprinter Noah Lyles posted in a social media chat room for the event. "It's such a great new way to compete.''
Duplantis, Lavillenie and Kendricks treated it almost like a track meet as they tried to average a jump per minute. The routine was simple: Vault, walk back with the pole, take a very quick breather -- maybe a sip of water -- and vault again.
Above all else, it was competition again. The outbreak of COVID-19 has the track and field season on hold.
"I miss the feeling of competing," Duplantis said. "I miss the feeling of being out there with the guys. It was a really fun time. It was fun to get back into the competition gear again.''

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pole vault pair share the spoils in garden challenge</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Renaud Lavillenie and Armand Duplantis tied in the innovative 30-minute contest.
Renaud Lavillenie opted to share victory with Armand Duplantis rather than head to a tie-break in pole vaulting’s ‘Ultimate Garden Clash’ – the latest innovation in at-home sporting entertainment.
Former Olympic gold medallist Lavillenie, world record holder Duplantis and reigning world champion Sam Kendricks signed up for the three-way challenge set up by World Athletics in a bid to fill the vacuum of elite competition.
The trio had two 15-minute rounds, split by a five-minute break, to clear a five-metre bar as many times as possible in their own gardens, with Lavillenie and Duplantis both level on 36 clearances.
Kendricks boasted the only 100 per cent record but was left behind on 26.
The idea of a three-minute ‘jump off’ was mooted to break the tie but Lavillenie, jumping at home in Clermont-Ferrand, was offered the chance to decide having completed his final effort marginally quicker.
Visibly exhausted he opted to split the honour with his rival, noting with a smile: “We can share it, but I am the first winner and Mondo (Duplantis) is the second winner!”
Louisiana-based Duplantis, the younger man by 13 years, was eager to go again but ultimately accepted his share of the spoils, adding “let’s share more sport like this, it’s fun.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Athletics: Duplantis, Lavillenie settle for tie in garden pole vault challenge</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Former Olympic pole vault champion Renaud Lavillenie of France and Sweden’s world record holder Mondo Duplantis shared the spoils in the Ultimate Garden Clash, despite competing in locations 8,000km apart during the COVID-19 lockdown.
Along with American Sam Kendricks, the trio attempted to vault 5m as many times as they could in 30 minutes in a format they devised together, connected via a live video link streamed to fans on the social media channels of World Athletics.
Kendricks attempted the challenge in Oxford, Mississippi, Duplantis was based in Lafayette, Louisiana while Lavillenie competed in his back garden in Clermont-Ferrand, France.
Duplantis took an early lead before Lavillenie caught up while Kendricks tried to pace himself. By the end of 30 minutes, Lavillenie and Duplantis had both cleared the height 36 times while Kendricks only managed 26.
“I’m done, I don’t want to take any risks. I’ll share the gold with Mondo,” Lavillenie said. “I was really missing the feeling I get competing.
“It’s crazy but even doing this in my garden, I get the same feeling I’d get at a major championships. It was very exciting and I’m very happy to be a part of it. I’m not going to do it every week, but I’m happy to do it once a year.”
Duplantis, who set the world record mark of 6.18m earlier this year, wanted to go on for three more minutes to break the tie but eventually decided to settle for the shared victory with the two-times Olympic medallist.
“It was really fun being out there competing against those guys,” Duplantis said. “I had really missed competing. I didn’t think it was going to end in a tie, but that’s sports.”
World Athletics president Sebastian Coe lauded the initiative and said he hoped there would be more such events during the lockdown.
The global governing body said they were exploring the possibility of holding similar events in the future.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Latest: Pole vaulters set bar in competition from homes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Latest on the effects of the new coronavirus outbreak on sports around the world:
Mondo Duplantis of Sweden and Renaud Lavillenie of France tied for the gold medal Sunday during a men’s pole vault competition held in their own backyards. It was a rare sporting event held during the coronavirus pandemic.
Duplantis and Lavillenie each cleared a height of 5 meters (16 feet) 36 times over a span of 30 minutes that was broadcast by World Athletics on its social media channels. Both had one miss. Sam Kendricks of the United States wound up third by clearing the bar 26 times.
They tried to figure out a tiebreaker before electing to award double gold. The 20-year-old Duplantis initially pushed for a three-minute playoffs, while the 33-year-old Lavillenie nixed the plan.
Lavillenie did clear his 36th bar seconds before Duplantis. The event was split into two 15-minute sessions with a short halftime.
The trio collaborated on the unique competition format since adjusting the bar wasn’t practical without officials in place.
Duplantis competed from his base in Lafayette, Louisiana. Kendricks was at his farm in Oxford, Mississippi, and Lavillenie took part from Clermont-Ferrand, France, as he pushed the family’s trampoline to the side in order to jump.
It was billed as the “Ultimate Garden Clash” and could be a model for future track events. The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the Tokyo Olympics being moved to 2021, along with the track and field season being put on hold.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Current situation is like Test match on dangerous wicket: Ganguly on COVID-19 pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: BCCI president Sourav Ganguly is deeply saddened and intimidated by the devastation caused because of the COVID-19 pandemic and has equated the unprecedented crisis to playing a Test match on a dangerous wicket.
The decorated former player opened up on life under lockdown due to the novel coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over 2.40 lakh lives across the world while infecting more than 34 lakh people.
"This situation is a Test match on a very dangerous wicket. The ball is seaming and spinning as well - the batsman has very little margin of error," Ganguly said while speaking on '100 Hours 100 Stars', an initiative started by Fever Network.
"So, the batsman has to score runs and keep his wicket safe with this little margin of error, and win this Test match," he added.
A winner of innumerable fierce battles during his playing days when there was no dearth of fearsome fast bowlers and quality spinners, Ganguly was tempted to draw a parallel between the tough moments in the sport and the health crisis.
"This is very difficult, but we hope that we will win this match together," he added.
Ganguly expressed his sadness at the number of lives lost in the pandemic and the irreparable damage that it has caused.
"I am really upset seeing the current situation, because so many people are suffering outside. We are still struggling to understand how to stop this pandemic," he said.
"This atmosphere all over the world has really bothered me. We don't know how, when and where it came from - we all were unprepared for this," he added.
Not just upset, Ganguly conceded he cannot help feeling a big scared of what's unfolding because of the disease.
"People are being affected by this so much. There have been so many deaths. This situation upsets me, and I also feel scared," he said.
"People come to my house to deliver groceries, food, so I feel a little scared as well. So it's a mixed feeling. I just want this to end as quickly as possible," he added, He said cricket has taught him to face tough situations in life and the importance of staying alert at all times.
Asked how he keeps himself positive, the former captain said: "Cricket has taught me a lot. I faced real life, high-pressure situations. You have to make runs and there is just one ball left. 
"If you make one wrong move, one wrong footwork, you will not get another chance. These kind of situations make you alert and aware about real life situations," he said.
The BCCI chief, though, also added that he is getting to spend a lot of time with his family after a long time.
"It's been a month into the lockdown. I didn't mind it earlier. Earlier, I wouldn't get time at home like this. My lifestyle involved travelling for work everyday.
"For the past 30-32 days, I have been at home with my family, spending time with my wife, daughter, my mother and my brother.
"I have got a time like this after long, so I am enjoying myself," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rays' Blake Snell wins inaugural MLB The Show Players League</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tampa Bay Rays ace Blake Snell won the inaugural MLB The Show Players League on Sunday with a three-game sweep in the video game against the Chicago White Sox's Lucas Giolito.
Snell's Rays beat Giolito's White Sox 5-1 in Game 1, 3-2 in Game 2 and 6-0 in Game 3 in the best-of-five championship series. The three-inning games were televised on ESPN.
The Boys & Girls Clubs of the Suncoast will receive a $25,000 donation thanks to Snell's championship victory. In addition, MLB, the players' association and Sony donated $5,000 on behalf of each participating player to a Boys & Girls Club affiliate in his team's community.
Snell tweeted, "I NEEED IT SO BAD" after his victory.
The Rays also congratulated Snell on Twitter by raising a virtual banner in his honor.
Players from all 30 teams competed in the league, which featured a 29-game regular season. Each player streamed his games online from his individual Twitch or YouTube account.
The Texas Rangers' Joey Gallo was voted by fans and players as the league's Best Player after starting out 11-0 in the league and earning the No. 2 seed for the postseason.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Snell sweeps Giolito, wins first MLB The Show Players League title</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tampa Bay Rays star and Cy Young hurler Blake Snell swept pitcher Lucas Giolito of the Chicago White Sox on Sunday to claim the inaugural MLB The Show Players League title in dominating fashion.
Snell claimed the best-of-five World Series 5-1, 3-2, 6-0 on his to winning 26 of his final 29 matchups overall. Snell lost just once over his three playoff series.
For a player who is steadfastly stingy on the real mound, Snell posted a league-leading 145 runs during the regular season of the Players League.
“Usually I’m super-aggressive in this league,” Snell told MLB.com regarding his approach at the plate going into the third game. “But facing Lucas, I know he’s getting a lot better, and I knew I had to be a lot more patient. Once he starts to learn how to hit better, he’s gonna be nasty. I was happy I was able to play him now, because he’s gonna be really good.”
“I haven’t faced many hitters like Blake,” Giolito added. “He just sees the ball really well. It was an offensive onslaught, and it was too much to overcome. He’s very, very good at this.”
Snell got off to a fast start in the Series, slugging a leadoff home run with Willy Adames in Game 1 against Giolito. He followed that up with HRs by Mike Zunino and Austin Meadows to cruise to the 5-1 win.
Though Snell took the title, he did not win the Best Player Award. That went to Joey Gallo, the No. 2 seed who suffered a stunning upset at the hands of seventh-seeded Ian Happ in the quarterfinals. Gallo earned 39.8 percent of the fan vote and 10 from his fellow competitors. Snell came in second.
Gallo also earned Best Cameo for his own virtual player slugging 13 home runs in 48 at-bats and posting a 1.814 OPS.
The Best Twitch Name went to Bo Bichette’s “BoFlows” nickname. Bichette took 24.8 percent of the fan vote and six from his peers.
Dwight Smith Jr. of the Orioles took home Best Manager award for doing more with less. Smith finished 19-10 and qualified for the postseason despite an O’s team with a 69 overall rating. Smith earned 34.2 of the fan vote and eight player votes.
Brett Phillips of the Kansas City Royals won Most Entertaining Streamer despite not winning the fan vote; Aaron Hicks won In-Game MVP after mashing 14 home runs and a 2.369 OPS in 29 regular-season games for teammate Tommy Kahnle, how represented the Yankees in the tournament.
Best Reaction goes to Rhys Hoskins of the Phillies and Cole Tucker of the Pirates. In their game, Tucker told Hoskins that he would name his first-born child after him if he hit a home run in his next at-bat. Hoskins sent the next pitcher into the left-field seats.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pujols' career on full display on MLB Network</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Albert Pujols incredible 19-year career will be on display all day on Monday on MLB Network, as six of his games will air as well as a new edition of MLB Tonight dedicated to the three-time MVP.
Pujols, a 10-time All-Star and the only player in Major League history with at least 650 homers and 650 doubles, began his career with the Cardinals in 2001 and helped them win World Series titles in 2006 and 2011 before signing with the Angels before the 2012 season.
MLB Network's coverage begins at 9 a.m. ET with a five-hit game from Pujols against the Cubs on July 20, 2004, when he smacked three homers and a double with five RBIs.
At noon ET, it's Pujols' 3,000th hit, coming against the Mariners on May 4, 2018, as the game is being aired on its two-year anniversary.
Next, at 2:30 p.m. ET, it’s a game from last year, as Pujols homered in his return to Busch Stadium against the Cardinals on June 22, 2019. It’s a rare game where the opposing fans gave a standing ovation to a visiting player.
MLB Tonight will then air at 6 p.m. ET with Matt Vasgersian, Carlos Peña and Dan Plesac discussing Pujols' career. It'll also feature a lengthy sit-down interview with Pujols and Harold Reynolds.
One of Pujols’ most iconic postseason moments airs next at 7 p.m. ET, as Game 5 of the 2005 NLCS will air. Pujols crushed a go-ahead three-run homer off Brad Lidge in Houston in the ninth inning to lift the Cardinals to a victory.
It's another legendary postseason game from Pujols airing at 9 p.m. ET with Game 3 of the 2011 World Series against the Rangers. Pujols went 5-for-6 with three homers, six RBIs and four runs scored in a 16-7 blowout win.
It wraps up at midnight ET with Pujols hitting his 600th career home run against the Twins on June 3, 2017, at Angel Stadium. Fittingly, it was a grand slam off Ervin Santana, as Pujols became the first player to ever hit a grand slam on a 600th homer. Only nine players have ever reached the 600-homer milestone.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Serie A teams can start individual training - interior ministry</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MILAN: Serie A teams will be able to start individual training sessions as of Monday amid the COVID-19 crisis, according to a letter sent by the Italian interior ministry to local authorities.
Prime minister Giuseppe Conte said last Sunday that individual training could start on May 4 and team training on May 18, only for sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora to say that athletes in individual sports could start training from May 4 and those in team sports must wait until May 18.
Spadafora's statement drew criticism and Serie A club Sassuolo on Saturday said they would allow their players to use their facilities from Monday.
Bologna, also based in the Emilia Romagna region where special permission was given for athletes in team sports to take part in training sessions on an individual basis from May 4, said players could resume training on Tuesday.
The region of Campania, which includes Naples, has also said that players can begin training. Napoli have yet to comment.
"Athletes and non athletes, of non individual disciplines, just like any citizen, are allowed to practise individual sporting activities, in private and public areas, in respect of the interpersonal safety distance of at least two metres and in respect of the ban to gather in any form," the interior ministry said in a letter to local authorities.
Serie A has been suspended since March 9 and the league and the Italian football federation (FIGC) both want to complete the season, although the Italian government says it has not yet decided whether it will give its permission to do so.

Spadafora’s statement drew criticism and Serie A club Sassuolo on Saturday said they would allow their players to use their facilities from Monday.
Bologna, also based in the Emilia Romagna region where special permission was given for athletes in team sports to take part in training sessions on an individual basis from May 4, said players could resume training on Tuesday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Cologne plan quarantine-like training camp, Verstraete backtracks over comments</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cologne are planning to move into a "quarantine-like" training camp after the Bundesliga club were hit with three positive coronavirus tests.
On Friday, Cologne announced three unspecified people at the club contracted COVID-19 amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has brought the Bundesliga and sport to a standstill globally.
The trio – which reportedly consists of two players and a physio – were consequently told to undergo a 14-day quarantine procedure.
A decision on the potential resumption of the Bundesliga is set to be made on Wednesday and Cologne announced they will head into a training camp in a protected location if politicians approve to conclude the 2019-20 campaign.
"This form of voluntary quarantine extends the existing infection control and hygiene concept and is intended to further reduce the risk of infection from COVID-19," Cologne said on Sunday. "The measure will be/has been taken regardless of the results of the COVID-19 tests at FC.
"The concept of the 'Task Force Sports Medicine/ Extraordinary Matchday Operation' of the DFL already provides that all teams go to quarantine-like training camps one week before the games restart. FC, however, prefer to start this period at the beginning of team training."
It comes after Cologne midfielder Birger Verstraete expressed his concern with the club still training amid the positive COVID-19 tests – though the Belgian has since apologised.
Verstraete spoke to Belgian TV station VTM and criticised Cologne for their handling of the three positive cases.
After Cologne responded and dismissed Verstraete's comments, the 26-year-old said: "I gave an interview about my personal concerns about my girlfriend potentially getting the virus. I expressed myself falsely in a few places, so that in the translation a misunderstanding has came about and I am sorry for that.
"Instead of giving an interview out of emotion, I should have contacted our doctor and had my questions answered. It was not my intention to blame the responsible authorities or Cologne. I feel comfortable and in good hands with FC.
"I will continue to give my all in training ... and I want to end the season in Cologne. My girlfriend, who belongs to the risk group because of a previous heart disease, will head home to Belgium and stay there for the time being."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Austria’s loosened lockdown means tennis players can return to the court as long as they stick to coronavirus-related rules – singles only, no touching each other’s tennis balls and definitely no shaking hands at the net.
Tennis is one of several social-distancing-compatible sports the conservative-led government allowed to resume from last Friday (May 1), part of a second wave of lockdown easing. Others include golf, horse riding, archery, shooting and mini golf.
Austria introduced its lockdown seven weeks ago and first relaxed it on April 14, when some shops were allowed to reopen. Leaving home for exercise like jogging was officially encouraged but sports clubs were closed, and most still are.
“During quarantine, I was wondering which wall I could play against and now I’m glad that I can finally play on court,” a player who gave his name as Yannis said at Smashing Suns, a club in Vienna’s upscale 13th district, which also houses the Schoenbrunn – a former imperial palace.
When he announced last month that some sports would resume, sports minister Werner Kogler said it would be up to federations to decide what new rules to impose to prevent infections and he singled out tennis as already having a list.
That list is on display at Smashing Suns. It includes arriving in tennis gear as changing rooms are closed and a recommendation that players mark their own balls.
Touching your opponent is banned, as are doubles matches and playing indoors.
“The players will definitely stick to them (the new rules), also because we check that they do. They are very disciplined and the pleasure of playing is greater than the willingness to risk something,” the club’s co-owner Dieter Mocker said.
“People definitely miss playing doubles. Almost 80 per cent of our members want to play doubles and we hope that will be possible again soon.”
For now, relief seems to be the overriding sentiment.
“The last few weeks were very bad without any exercise – I walked a bit, but otherwise nothing,” said regular player Michaela Werni.
“Not seeing tennis friends was a drastic reduction in my quality of life...
“Now it is great and a totally new experience to finally be able to move around outdoors and with nice friends, even if it is with some restrictions.” – REUTERS

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Serie A players get green light to train from Italian government</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Serie A clubs are set to return to training grounds next week after getting the go ahead from the Italian Government.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's plans to ease lockdown restrictions had initially made provisions for individual athletes to resume work from Monday, with team sports scheduled to follow suit on May 18.
There were reports that the disparity of that approach was being challenged by some regional assemblies - and the prospect of some top-flight clubs resuming while others remained banned from doing so has seemingly forced a change of heart.
Sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora called for a review of the decision and both Corriere dello Sport and Gazzetta dello Sport quote a communique signed by interior minister Matteo Piantedosi, which allows for high performance centres to open their doors provided social distancing measures are observed.
The note reportedly said: "Athletes and non-athletes of non-individual disciplines, like every citizen, are allowed to participate in individual sports in public or private areas, respecting the interpersonal safety distance of at least two metres."
Individual teams are likely to pursue their own arrangements now, steered by regional guidelines and their own preparedness to safely staff facilities.
However, there is no certainty that the Serie A season will resume, with Juventus top of the paused table, just a point ahead of Lazio.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Serie A clubs given green light to open training centres</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Serie A clubs are set to return to training grounds next week after getting the go ahead from the Italian government.
Prime minister Giuseppe Conte’s plans to ease lockdown restrictions had initially made provisions for individual athletes to resume work from Monday, with team sports scheduled to follow suit on May 18th.
There were reports that the disparity of that approach was being challenged by some regional assemblies and the prospect of some top-flight clubs resuming while others remained banned from doing so has seemingly forced a change of heart.
Sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora called for a review of the decision and both Corriere dello Sport and Gazzetta dello Sport quote a communique signed by interior minister Matteo Piantedosi which allows for high performance centres to open their doors provided social distancing measures are observed.
“Athletes and non-athletes of non-individual disciplines, like every citizen, are allowed to participate in individual sports in public or private areas, respecting the interpersonal safety distance of at least two metres,” the note reportedly said.
Individual teams are likely to pursue their own arrangements now, steered by regional guidelines and their own preparedness to safely staff facilities.
There is no certainty that the Serie A season will resume, with Juventus top of the paused table just a point ahead of Lazio.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Serie A return decision changed by Italian government</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Serie A clubs will now be allowed to return to training on Monday, two weeks ahead of schedule, as football continues its attempts to come back from coronavirus chaos.
The Italian government had initially decreed that only athletes from individual sports would be allowed to recommence training from this Monday, with team sports scheduled for May 18.
But a decision from the regional assembly of Emilia-Romagna to bring their date forward resulted in a change of heart from national interior minister Matteo Piantedosi, who has now stated that training grounds can be opened providing that social distancing guidelines are followed.
Italian publications Corriere dello Sport and Gazzetta dello Sport both carried a note signed by Piantedosi, which read: “Athletes and non-athletes of non-individual disciplines, like every citizen, are allowed to participate in individual sports in public or private areas, respecting the interpersonal safety distance of at least two metres."
The decision in Emilia-Romagna had meant initially that just four Serie A clubs were planning to return on Monday - Sassuolo, Bologna, Parma and SPAL.
A Sassuolo statement read: "Players will only be allowed access to the pitches in compliance with rules of social distancing, while access to the Sports Center will be prohibited.
"The individual sessions, which will take place during the mornings from Monday to Friday, with the use of three fields, with six players per hour (one player for each half of the pitch), will not be attended by the technical staff, while an emergency health supervision will be guaranteed."
Training is only open to those players who have been in Italy during lockdown, with any player returning from outside of the country - such as Cristiano Ronaldo - forced into quarantine for two weeks.
There are still thought to be numerous obstacles to overcome to ensure Serie A starts again, with Juventus currently sitting one point ahead of Lazio at the top.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rohit has an edge over Kohli in terms of impact in white-ball format: Gautam Gambhir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former India opener Gautam Gambhir feels that Rohit Sharma has been able to make more impact in white ball cricket compared to Virat Kohli despite Indian skipper's staggering statistics in shorter formats.
Gambhir, however, believes that Kohli will end up scoring more runs than Rohit.
"... for me white-ball cricket is all about impact. Kohli will end up getting many more runs than Rohit, and Kohli is among the greatest right now, but Rohit has an edge over Kohli because of the impact he has," Gambhir told Sports Tak, according to India Today website.
"I think he (Rohit) is the best white-ball cricketer in the world right now. He is not the greatest overall but at the moment he is the best. He is the only player to have hit 3 ODI double hundreds, 5 World Cup hundreds (in one edition) and he is also the only player, who once gets past 100-run mark, people say that he missed a double century."
Talking further about Kohli and Rohit, the 2011 World Cup winner said, "It is very difficult to compare both of them. Virat Kohli is unbelievable. His stats prove that.
"But when your reputation is such that when you get out after a hundred, people say he has missed out on double hundred, that speaks volumes about you."
The 33-year-old Rohit has scored 9115 runs from 224 ODIs at an average of 49.27 at a strike rate of 88.92. He has 29 hundreds and 43 fifties to his name. In T20Is, Rohit has scored 2273 runs from 108 matches at an average of 32.62 and a strike rate of 138.78.
The 31-year-old Kohli, on the other hand, has scored 11867 runs from 248 ODIs at an average of 59.33 at a strike rate of 93.25. He has scored 43 centuries and 58 half centuries. Kohli has also scored 2794 runs from 82 T20Is at an average of 50.80 and a strike rate of 138.24.
The 38-year-old Gambhir, now a BJP Member of Parliament, gave credit to Mahendra Singh Dhoni for Rohit's successful career.
"Where Rohit is today, it is because of MS Dhoni. One good thing about MS was that he always kept Rohit in the talks, even if was not part of the team, he was always part of the group. He never let him get sidelined," Gambhir said.
It's the backing of a captain that makes or breaks a player, Gambhir said.
"You can talk about the selection committee and team management, but if you do not have the backing from your captain than it is all useless. Everything is in the hands of the captain. How MS Dhoni had backed Rohit Sharma over a period of time, I do not think any player has been given such support."
Rohit made his ODI debut for India in 2007, but it was only after Dhoni promoted him as an opener in 2013 that his career turned around.
He said Kohli and Rohit should groom youngsters in the current team in the same way Dhoni groomed them.
"Rohit is the prime example of how a player's fortunes can turn around if he is nurtured by the seniors. I hope the young cricketers in the current generation, be it Shubman Gill or Sanju Samson, they also get similar kind of support.
"And now when Rohit is a senior, I expect him to back youngsters."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rohit Sharma has edge over Virat Kohli in white-ball cricket, says Gautam Gambhir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rohit Sharma has an edge over Virat Kohli in cricket’s shorter formats even though Kohli will end up with more runs in his career, former India opener Gautam Gambhir said. He said this is because of the ‘impact’ Rohit has in ODIs and T20Is, adding that the current India opener is the ‘best white-ball cricketer in the world right now’.
“For me white-ball cricket is all about impact. Kohli will end up getting many more runs than Rohit, and Kohli is among the greatest right now, but Rohit has an edge over Kohli because of the impact he has,” Gambhir told Sports Tak.
“I think he (Rohit) is the best white-ball cricketer in the world right now. He is not the greatest overall but at the moment he is the best. He is the only player to have hit 3 ODI double hundreds, 5 World Cup hundreds (in one edition) and he is also the only player, who once gets past 100-run mark, people say that he missed a double century.”
Gambhir also said that Kohli’s batting records speak enough about his class.
The 33-year-old Rohit has scored 9115 runs from 224 ODIs at an average of 49.27 at a strike rate of 88.92. He has 29 hundreds and 43 fifties to his name. In T20Is, Rohit has scored 2273 runs from 108 matches at an average of 32.62 and a strike rate of 138.78.
The 31-year-old Kohli, on the other hand, has scored 11867 runs from 248 ODIs at an average of 59.33 at a strike rate of 93.25. He has scored 43 centuries and 58 half centuries. Kohli has also scored 2794 runs from 82 T20Is at an average of 50.80 and a strike rate of 138.24.
Gambhir also added that Rohit Sharma had prospered because of the backing he had received from MS Dhoni. “Where Rohit is today, it is because of MS Dhoni. One good thing about MS was that he always kept Rohit in the talks, even if was not part of the team, he was always part of the group. He never let him get sidelined,” Gambhir said. “I don’t think any player received such support,” he added.
Speaking later in the chat, Gambhir also named his all-time Test XI for India.
Gambhir’s all-time India Test XI – Sunil Gavaskar, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Kapil Dev, MS Dhoni, Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble (captain), Zaheer Khan and Javagal Srinath.

He is the only player to have hit 3 ODI double hundreds, 5 World Cup hundreds (in one edition) and he is also the only player, who once gets past 100-run mark, people say that he missed a double century."

Talking further about Kohli and Rohit, the 2011 World Cup winner said, "It is very difficult to compare both of them. Virat Kohli is unbelievable. His stats prove that.
"But when your reputation is such that when you get out after a hundred, people say he has missed out on double hundred, that speaks volumes about you."
The 33-year-old Rohit has scored 9115 runs from 224 ODIs at an average of 49.27 at a strike rate of 88.92. He has 29 hundreds and 43 fifties to his name. In T20Is, Rohit has scored 2273 runs from 108 matches at an average of 32.62 and a strike rate of 138.78.
The 31-year-old Kohli, on the other hand, has scored 11867 runs from 248 ODIs at an average of 59.33 at a strike rate of 93.25. He has scored 43 centuries and 58 half centuries. Kohli has also scored 2794 runs from 82 T20Is at an average of 50.80 and a strike rate of 138.24.
The 38-year-old Gambhir, now a BJP Member of Parliament, gave credit to Mahendra Singh Dhoni for Rohit's successful career.
"Where Rohit is today, it is because of MS Dhoni. One good thing about MS was that he always kept Rohit in the talks, even if was not part of the team, he was always part of the group. He never let him get sidelined," Gambhir said.
It's the backing of captain that makes or breaks a player, Gambhir said.
"You can talk about the selection committee and team management, but if you do not have the backing from your captain than it is all useless. Everything is in the hands of the captain. How MS Dhoni had backed Rohit Sharma over a period of time, I do not think any player has been given such support."
Rohit made his ODI debut for India in 2007, but it was only after Dhoni promoted him as an opener in 2013 that his career turned around.
He said Kohli and Rohit should groom youngsters in the current team in the same way Dhoni groomed them.
"Rohit is the prime example of how a player's fortunes can turn around if he is nurtured by the seniors. I hope the young cricketers in the current generation, be it Shubman Gill or Sanju Samson, they also get similar kind of support.
"And now when Rohit is a senior, I expect him to back youngsters."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Having a strong social media presence, Aakash Chopra has made himself a fine content creator that engages his fans all the time. Recently, in line with the ICC’s post to pick one player from each country to pick a XI, Aakash Chopra immediately jumped into the bandwagon to have his own team.
While his selection of Jos Buttler was unquestionable, he picked David Warner ahead of Rohit Sharma as the opener. It was surprising considering the Aussie has been a massive underperformer in T20Is, unlike his performance in the other form of T20 cricket. 
But Chopra’s selection seems to be in direct line with having to pick Jasprit Bumrah into the XI that adds balance in the presence of Rashid Khan, Sandeep Lamichhane, Lasith Malinga along with Shakib Al Hasan and Andre Russell. Colin Munro becomes the Kiwi representative in the line-up while Babar Azam and AB de Villiers are the flagbearers of the two Green armies - Pakistan and South Africa. 
Aakash Chopra’s World T20I XI: David Warner, Jos Buttler, Colin Munro, Babar Azam, AB de Villiers, Shakib Al Hasan, Andre Russell, Rashid Khan, Sandeep Lamichhane, Jasprit Bumrah, Lasith Malinga.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Liverpool should be awarded Premier League title, says Houllier</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier believes his old club should be awarded the Premier League title even if the season is not completed because of the COVID-19 crisis.
Liverpool are 25 points clear at the top with nine games left to play in the Premier League, which has been on hold since March 9 as the novel coronavirus spread across the globe.
According to Houllier, who led Liverpool to FA Cup and UEFA Cup glory in 2001 during his six-year spell at Anfield, Juergen Klopp's team would be deserved champions.
Asked if they should be awarded their first top-flight title since 1990, the former France coach told TalkSport: "Yeah. That’s what they did in France. They gave it to Paris St Germain. They had a 12-point lead and I think Liverpool needed just two games to win the title.
"If there was a difference of maybe two or three points then you could argue it takes some chances away from teams behind but 25 points there is no way they wouldn’t be champions. They deserve it."
Houllier, now an adviser to Olympique Lyonnais president Jean-Michel Aulas, added that the Premier League should follow the government's lead on whether to resume.
"I think they should follow the government’s rules. If the government decides we stop then we have to abide by that," he explained.
"Second, maybe wait a little bit because we don’t know what it’s going to be like in a fortnight or in three weeks time." (Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ed Osmond)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Houllier says Liverpool ‘deserve’ to be awarded Premier League title if season isn’t finished</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier has told TalkSPORT that former club Liverpool ‘deserve’ to be awarded the Premier League title if the Coronavirus pandemic leads to the season not being completed.
Jurgen Klopp’s side hold a massive 25-point lead at the top of the table, with the Reds needing just six points to mathematically secure their first ever Premier League title and first league title in 30 years.
The top-flight has now been suspended for almost two months due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
Football fans across the entire world will be waiting to see how some of Europe’s top leagues decide on what action to take, especially since the remainder of the Ligue 1 season was cancelled.
This led to Paris Saint-Germain being crowned champions, this action was taken as the French government have banned sporting events until September.
Here’s what Houllier had to say on the matter:
“Yeah. That’s what they did in France. They gave it to Paris Saint-Germain. They had a 12 point lead and I think Liverpool needed just two games to win the title.”
“If there was a difference of maybe two or three points then you could argue it takes some chances away from teams behind but 25 points there is no way they wouldn’t be champions. They deserve it.”
Houllier also added that the top-flight should consider these things before making a decision: 
“I think they should follow the government’s rules. If the government decides we stop then we have to abide by that.”
“Second, maybe wait a little bit because we don’t know what it’s going to be like in a fortnight or in three weeks time.”
“Three, to consult also the players, the PFA and the LMA because if you want to go back because you need everybody to go back with heart and the will to finish the season.”
“We need to assess the risk and see what happens.”
“In France, they decided to stop it. Maybe to my view it was a bit too early to take that decision but the government decided so the league had to follow.”
Houllier, who also manager PSG and the France senior national team, as well as some of the youth sides, spent six years as Liverpool boss.
The Frenchman won the FA Cup once with the Reds, as well as two League Cups and the UEFA Cup in 2001 (now known as the Europa League).
Five of Houllier’s six trophies with the Reds were actually won during the 2000/2001 season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man City star Kevin De Bruyne makes prediction for Premier League return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne says he thinks the Premier League season will get underway again soon.
The Belgian midfielder has admitted that a two-year ban from European football for City could cause him to consider his future at the club, but says a one-year break could be manageable.
City were going well before the postponement of football this season, picking up a win away to Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.
They are some way off Liverpool in the Premier League, but have already won the Carabao Cup and are also through to the FA Cup quarter-finals where they were scheduled to face Newcastle.
And De Bruyne believes it will not be too long before the players are back competing - with parties reportedly hoping for a return on June 8.
"My feeling says that we may be able to train again within two weeks,” De Bruyne told HLN. "The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give people something.
"Everything will be finished without fans, I think. That is not really interesting for anyone, but this season will be finished.
"The financial aspect is far too important in the Premier League. If the season is not finished, it will cause serious problems."
City teammate Sergio Aguero said he and other players were scared of the prospect of returning to football too soon, and De Bruyne says he understands, but does not feel financial concerns are being placed ahead of players' health.
"[Financial concerns above players' health?] Not so much. Everyone will be tested once we start playing again," he added.
"Gosh, I don't think they are really afraid of themselves, but of their family. That is mainly the problem for many people."

June 12 is the new target for top-flight action to resume, although it is still unclear whether that will happen with players concerned for their safety amid the continuing coronavirus pandemic.
When the season was halted due to the outbreak of the deadly virus, Liverpool were a massive 25 points clear of second-placed Manchester City, needing just two wins from their remaining nine games to end the club's 30-year wait for the top-flight title.
And Houllier has urged the Premier League to follow the example of his native France, where the Ligue 1 was ended 12 games early and leaders Paris-Saint Germain were declared champions.
Houllier, who was manager of Liverpool from 1998 until 2004, was asked by TalkSport whether Liverpool should be given the Premier League crown in the same way.
“Yeah," said Houllier. "That’s what they did in France.
"They gave it to Paris Saint-Germain. They had a 12-point lead and I think Liverpool needed just two games to win the title.
“If there was a difference of maybe two or three points then you could argue it takes some chances away from teams behind but 25 points there is no way they wouldn't be champions. They deserve it.”
Despite his calls for Liverpool to be crowned champions, Houllier felt the decision to end Ligue 1 in France may have been taken a little too early.
Houllier, who led Liverpool to five trophies in 2001 plus the League Cup the following year, said: "We need to assess the risk and see what happens.
“In France, they decided to stop it.
"Maybe to my view it was a bit too early to take that decision but the government decided so the league had to follow.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Two years would be long – De Bruyne may consider Man City future if CL ban is upheld</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin De Bruyne may have to consider his Manchester City future should the club's two-season ban from the Champions League be upheld, though he has no immediate desire to leave the club.
De Bruyne has been in sensational form for City this season, though football seasons across Europe have either been placed on hold or cancelled due to the coronavirus crisis.
Prior to the suspension of matches, De Bruyne played a starring role as City took a 2-1 lead over Real Madrid in the away first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.
It remains to be seen whether City will be able to compete in UEFA's flagship club competition over the next two campaigns, with the club having been banned due to breaches of Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations.
Pressed on whether the ban could impact his future at City, De Bruyne suggested a two-year suspension could lead to him considering his options, though he has faith in the club winning their appeal against the sanction.
"I'm just waiting," said De Bruyne in a video interview with HLN Live. "The club has told us that they are going to appeal and that they are almost one hundred percent sure that they are right.
"That's why I'm waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team. Once the statement is made, I will review everything.
"Two years [without European football] would be long, in the case of one year I might see.
"But I'm very happy with City. I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England – for my competitive view the best competition – and I like that.
"It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too. What is coming is coming."
Pep Guardiola's future at City is also in doubt, with the former Barcelona boss' contract set to expire in 2021.
De Bruyne, though, refuted the suggestion a decision on his next move will depend on whether or not Guardiola remains at City.
"Not particularly. I think Pep says he will take his year of contract anyway, then his contract ends," De Bruyne said.
"But I'm not going to let my decision depend on what Pep is doing. Of course I have already worked with other coaches and when Pep leaves, I have to continue working with someone else.
"But I haven't really paid much attention to that for the time being. There are more important things at the moment."
Reports emerged on Saturday claiming Roberto Martinez had extended his contract as coach of the Belgian national team, a move welcomed by De Bruyne.
"The choice was his. Maybe he would have done something different if the European Championship was played this summer. But we have a project, which is far from complete. Stopping now would be weird. It seems logical to me that he renews his contract," De Bruyne said.
"Everyone is happy to stay longer. Why is he a good coach? Well, Martinez has a lot of experience.
"Tactically, he has learned a lot in England. He let us play in a fixed system, and that works. The team has grown in recent years."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sergio Aguero explains why Virgil van Dijk is so difficult for strikers to play against</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sergio Aguero says Virgil van Dijk's "long legs" make him a nightmare for forwards like him to face.
The Manchester City star has come up against Liverpool's Van Dijk in Premier League and Champions League tussles since the Dutchman joined the Reds from Southampton in January 2018.
City's all-time top goalscorer has kept up an impressive record of scoring seven times against Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium throughout his time in England, but incredibly he has never netted at Anfield across 11 appearances for City and former club Atletico Madrid.
Van Dijk is one of the key reasons for that record currently, and the Argentinean is full of praise for the defender.
"We all know Van Dijk is one of the best centre-backs in the world. He's strong, tall, has an incredible body," Aguero told El Chiringuito, via Goal.com.
"He's very strong face to face, he plays with his body. Also, given he is so tall, he has those long legs.
"It looks like he isn't fast but he is, because of his long legs – he can reach everywhere. Two steps from him are 50 for me!
"What I like the most is the way he is so smart when defending. He's not anxious when marking, he's very careful and patient. That makes it difficult for many strikers.
"In my case, I'm pretty fast and I like to dribble, so I need the defender to come. But if he holds he can wait for help from another defender. He's very good at this."
City had been due to face Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium on the first weekend on April in a match that could have seen the Reds take their Premier League crown, but it remains to be seen where and when the fixture will take place.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Aguero explains why deceptive Van Dijk is just so good</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has explained why Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk is so difficult to play against.
The star attacker believes the centre-back is one of the best defenders in world football, citing the Dutchman's patient approach and imposing physical nature as just two of his world-class attributes.
Van Dijk signed for the Reds in January 2018 and transformed the backline, playing a huge part in the Champions League success last term and incredible Premier League run over the last two seasons.
"We all know Van Dijk is one of the best centre-backs in the world. He's strong, tall, has an incredible body," Aguero told El Chiringuito.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sergio Aguero names surprising thing about Liverpool FC defender Virgil van Dijk</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester City star Sergio Aguero has explained why Liverpool centre-back Virgil van Dijk is one of the best defenders in the world and spoken about why it is so hard to play against him.
Van Dijk has been highly influential for Liverpool since moving to Anfield from Southampton in January 2018, playing a huge role in Liverpool's Champions League win in 2019 and this season's incredible run in the Premier League.
And Aguero says it is the defender's patient approach and imposing physical nature that make him a tricky proposition for attackers.
"We all know Van Dijk is one of the best centre-backs in the world. He's strong, tall, has an incredible body," Aguero told El Chiringuito.
"He's very strong face to face, he plays with his body. Also, given he is so tall, he has those long legs..."
Aguero suggested Van Dijk could surprise some players with his deceptive pace.
"It looks like he isn't fast but he is, because of his long legs – he can reach everywhere," Aguero added. "Two steps from him are 50 for me!
"What I like the most is the way he is so smart when defending. He's not anxious when marking, he's very careful and patient. That makes it difficult for many strikers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Origi improving under Klopp at Liverpool and not interested in move</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Divock Origi is certain his game is improving despite the limited opportunities at Liverpool and wants to continue working with Jurgen Klopp.
Origi established himself as an Anfield cult hero last season with a series of crucial goals, including a clinching strike in the Champions League final win over Tottenham.
The Belgium international has netted a further five times in all competitions this season, but he is firmly behind star trio Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane in the pecking order.
Origi signed an improved "long-term" contract on Merseyside in July 2019, and he has no intention of moving on.
"I am a better player than last year," the 25-year-old forward told Het Laatste Nieuws. "Klopp has given me the space to develop myself.
"I always listen to my instinct and continue to work. We have spoken with Liverpool and we have a nice course ahead of us. I just want to get better here.
"It is a project for me and I want to follow it. I don't know how long I will do that. I feel that I am making progress, so it was a pity that the season stopped [due to coronavirus]."
Origi continues to revel in his goal against Spurs, adding: "I took a lot of pleasure from that moment. It was a very calm moment.
"I was able to connect with the supporters. I saw their facial expressions. It is a feeling that is very difficult to explain.
"[Andy] Robertson jumped on my back, Fabinho joined and Virgil [Van Dijk]. Unbelievable.
"The more days pass, the more I can enjoy it. It's like wine, it matures with time."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has admitted that Liverpool superstar Virgil van Dijk is one of the best defenders in the world.
The Argentine explained that the Dutch captain’s ability to be patient in his approach, combined with his physical attributes, makes him the complete defender.

The City man has played against big Virg on a number of occasions, at club and international level, so you know he’s speaking from experience.
It’s nice to hear one big name in the beautiful game talk about another in such a way, putting rivalries aside.
Aguero is one of the best forwards the Premier League has seen, I’m not too shy to admit it, and he’s played against some of the best defenders in the world.
For him to talk about van Dijk (a star player of a rival club) like this is a breath of fresh air.
With the Dutchman at the heart of the team, Liverpool were on course to win the domestic title before the coronavirus pandemic brought the world to a standstill.
The No.4 has played a massive part in our success, with both him and Alisson completely transforming our defensive line-up ahead of our record sixth Champions League triumph last season.

"It is a project for me and I want to follow it. I don't know how long I will do that. I feel that I am making progress, so it was a pity that the season stopped [due to coronavirus]."
Origi continues to revel in his goal against Spurs, adding: "I took a lot of pleasure from that moment. It was a very calm moment.
"I was able to connect with the supporters. I saw their facial expressions. It is a feeling that is very difficult to explain.
"[Andy] Robertson jumped on my back, Fabinho joined and Virgil [Van Dijk]. Unbelievable.
"The more days pass, the more I can enjoy it. It's like wine, it matures with time."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Besiktas want to re-sign Fabricio</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The goalkeeper has played just the four matches for Mallorca this season as he is number two to Manolo Reina.
The veteran keeper Fabricio Agosto could be on the way back to Turkey. Besiktas, where he had the best matches of his career, want to sign him again for next season.
'Fanatik' talks about this option for the Fulham goalie who is on loan at Mallorca this season. He has been in Manolo Reina's shadow on the Balearics and in the only league game he has played, against Valladolid, his performance was quite questionable.

Fabricio, whose Fulham contract expires in 2021, was unable to get regular first team football in England in 2018-19 as well. 
He did get that at Besiktas, where he played 87 matches and conceded 94 goals. In addition, he ended up participating in the Champions League so the Spanish goalkeeper may be open to a return.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reds have allegedly identified the 25-year-old as a potential summer target, with the club thought to be keen to bring in competition for Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane in the final third.
Correa has been in impressive form for his Italian club during the 2019-20 campaign, contributing eight goals and four assists in 27 appearances in all competitions.
The South American has said that he is currently focused on Lazio but wants to play in England's top flight at some point in the future.
"I'd like to play in the Premier League. Right now, I am concentrating on Lazio, but I enjoy the English league too. I would want to improve my English and I will do that," Vazquez said on an Instagram Live.
The attacker has a contract with his Serie A side until the end of the 2023-24 campaign.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Diogo Jota: I'm Coaching Telford United on Football Manager'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Diogo Jota has not been making headlines recently because, like most people, he has been observing the British government’s lockdown. But in the simpler time before football and society were placed into suspended animation, Jota looked to be building towards something sensational.
His devastating bursts from the left side of Wolves’ attacks brought six goals in five matches before the hiatus, taking his tally for the season to 15 goals. Wolves were well placed in both the Premier League and the Europa League. Then the whole world pressed pause and none of that was important.
Jota has no complaints, he understands. As he and everyone else wait for the pandemic to subside, the 23-year-old agreed to reflect on his career and the season so far. What harm can that do? He talked about his and Wolves’ improvement, as well as Liverpool’s title credentials and the unique impact made by his Portuguese compatriot Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United.
First, though, he said how strange it is to be so far from his family in Portugal at a time of crisis while acknowledging he has a lot for which to be thankful, nonetheless. “If I was in Portugal it might be even more difficult to manage, as I would be closer to them and the temptation to have social contacts would be greater,” he said.
“Being here, that is harder, and [staying indoors] is what we must do. I obviously hope my family does not receive bad news and I try to pass on to them all the messages that I get from the club: to avoid leaving home unless it is extremely necessary. The goal is for us all to be together again once this situation ends.”
Wolves were the first top-flight club to close their stadium following the suspension of the league with their chairman, Jeff Shi, saying his ties to China made him “acutely aware” of the dangers of the coronavirus and immediately pledging to ensure all staff continue to be paid throughout this “period of uncertainty”. The company that owns the club, Fosun, donated 2,300 coverall and face masks to local hospitals.
The players, meanwhile, have been benefiting from an enviable level of care. “The club have helped us in everything,” said Jota. “The club managed to find a basket with all kinds of food, so we don’t have to go shopping. And in the medical area, we were given a kit with everything we need. I’m talking about masks, hand sanitiser and everything. The club does everything in their power so that we don’t miss anything.”
As for keeping fit before the notional resumption of the season, “the coaching staff drew up a plan for this first stage, which is said to last until the end of April but from the looks of it, it will last beyond that”, Jota told the Portuguese newspaper Record. “We have an individual work plan, with the idea of being as close to our best shape as possible.”
For Jota, football is a passion that never stops. So during his confinement he has been playing a virtual version of it. “I happen to be training Telford United on Football Manager. I’m already in 2029.” Being a playtime coach makes him appreciate all the more the work that Nuno Espírito Santo and Wolves’ backroom have done in real life to lift the club to where they are now from the Championship, which is where they were when Jota joined from Atlético Madrid in 2017, initially on loan.
“Detaching myself from it, you understand more clearly why this and that happened the way it did,” he said. “There is clearly influence from the coaching staff. From the physical part, where Antonio [Dias] helps us a lot. Then we have a mental coach, Julio [Figueroa], who helps us a lot too. We know that for every problem we face we will always have someone related to that specific area who can help us.
“For example, if we look at last season compared to this one, we see that we have been changing the tactical system a few times, adapting to the opposing teams, taking away from them any chance of breaking our system. And with these systems enhancing our qualities, we players have to adapt and help the team as well as possible.”
Jota also admires work done at other clubs. He would have no quibble with Liverpool being crowned champions if this season were to be cancelled. “If we were to have the misfortune of not being able to end the season, I think that few people would oppose this. Of course, there are always rival clubs that could be against that but I think 95% of people would agree. For me they would be fair champions.”
Which is not to say that Liverpool are his favourite Merseyside club. When he was growing up in Portugal, the English team he most enjoyed watching wore blue. “I loved to watch Everton play, especially when they were playing at home. It was not a club that fought for the title but that always made life very complicated for the big teams. And I loved that drive and competitiveness. They were relentless.”
Attitude is a quality Jota cherishes as much as skill. He reckons Fernandes, for instance, has uplifted Manchester United by inspiring the club’s other players to raise their standards. “I don’t know if he is the best [player at United] but he’s the most ambitious. And that makes a difference.
“You can clearly see the difference between United with and without Bruno Fernandes. He takes on the responsibility and aspires for more than what they are doing. I think they owe him a lot already. And that is not only related to his quality, but also to his ambition and personality.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Frank Lampard explains why he feels sorry for 'world class' N'Golo Kante</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Frank Lampard has sympathised with ‘world class’ Chelsea midfielder N’Golo Kante whose ‘four or five incredible seasons’ have had a detrimental impact on his fitness.
The 29-year-old has been one of the top-performing midfielders in world football, winning two Premier League titles with Leicester City and Chelsea, and the World Cup with France in 2018.
Kante has featured in over 34 top-flight games in each of the past four years, a record which has caught up with the France international this campaign, forcing him to miss large portions of the season with multiple injuries.
Several Blues players, including Tammy Abraham and Kante were facing long spells on the sidelines before the season was postponed due to the coronavirus crisis, but may now be available to play when the football eventually returns.
Lampard told BT Sport: ‘We had four or five of those [injured players] when we finished playing recently.
‘N’Golo Kante is obviously a great example because he’s played four or five incredible seasons in terms of his individual success and he’s been used quite rightly by his managers a lot.
‘This season he’s played only about 40% of our games and even then it’s been difficult for him and I’ve really felt for him on an individual level. He’s been a huge miss for us.
‘Looking forward whenever a restart comes we want to get him in the best shape, want to get Ruben Loftus-Cheek in the best shape.
‘We’ve had slightly different plans for them but they’ve been scuppered with what we’ve had to do.
‘The players health comes first the mental wellbeing of the players comes first.
‘The self-isolation was tough at first because nobody really knew what it was about we are just trying to get those players who have had extra problems fitter and of course when we get a chance to get back to full training we can get them back to where we need them to be.
‘We obviously need N’Golo Kante back in our team one of the best players in the world. I knew that before I became manager of Chelsea and know that now from working with him.
‘I haven’t been able to have him much this year and of course going forward we of course want him fit and raring to go.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mourinho reveals the only time he cried because of football</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CAIRO_2 May 2020: Mourinho, former Real Madrid manager and the current manager of Tottenham Hotspur, revealed that Madrid's loss to Bayern Munich in 2012 UEFA Champions League semis was the only time he cried because of football. "That season, Real Madrid were the best team in Spain and also the best in Europe. That's why it was so hard for us to deal with going out to Bayern in the Champions League." Mourinho told Marca. In 2012 UEFA Champions League semi-final, Real Madrid lost the first leg in Munich 2_1 but they bounced back in Madrid and won the game 2_1 to send the game to extra time. Both teams failed to decide the game during the extra time to send the game to penalties which ended with a 3_1 win for the Bavarian side. Mourinho continued "I remember it well. [Aitor] Karanka and I, outside my house, in my car, crying. It was very hard because in that season we were the best team in Europe.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mourinho: My Real Madrid deserved to win the Champions League</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jose Mourinho has said that Real Madrid deserved to win the Champions League during his three-year spell at the club.
Mourinho won the La Liga title and the Copa del Rey but failed to claim a long-awaited 10th European Cup at the Bernabeu.

The Portuguese boss led the team to three consecutive semifinals and said the defeat to Bayern Munich during the 2011-12 season was his biggest disappointment.
"That season, Real Madrid were the best team in Spain and also the best in Europe," he told Marca. "That's why it was so hard for us to deal with going out to Bayern in the Champions League.
"That night is the only time in my career as a coach that I've cried after a defeat. I remember it well... Aitor [Karanka] and I pulled up in front of my house, in the car, crying...It was very hard because we were the best that season.
"We had a very clearly defined playing identity. We were always very well organised defensively above anything else on the pitch and everyone knew exactly what they had to do.
"And we were capable of making transitions that were very explosive, quick and direct towards the objective, always looking towards the goal with connections that were almost unstoppable.
"The truth is that team deserved to win La Liga and the Champions League."
Madrid claimed La Decima under Carlo Ancelotti a year after Mourinho left the club and went on to win the Champions League four times in five seasons with Zinedine Zidane.
Before the coronavirus pandemic halted the sport, Mourinho's Tottenham were knocked out of the competition after a 4-0 aggregate defeat to RB Leipzig.
Mourinho said he considers football's return as a "public service," and prefers to finish the season even if it is played behind closed doors.
"If we play the nine league games that remain, it would be good for each one of us, good for football and good for the Premier League. It would be a good sign," he added.
"I like to think that football is never behind closed doors because there will be TV cameras there and, as a result, there will be millions of people watching it."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Seven Liverpool stars make FIFA 20 team of the season so far</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Liverpool players dominate the FIFA 20 Team of the Season So Far, with seven in the squad.
Reds defender Virgil van Dijk and Manchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne are the highest-rated players in the squad, with both given a 99 after fine seasons for their respective clubs.
Van Dijk is joined in the FIFA 20 team by Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson, right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold and strikers Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah.
The Reds forwards have 30 goals and 13 assists between them in the Premier League this term.
Left-back Andy Robertson is on the bench, as is midfielder and skipper Jordan Henderson.
With Jurgen Klopp's side having amassed a whopping 25-point lead at the top of the Premier League by the time the season was suspended due to coronavirus, it is certainly no surprise to see so many Liverpool players in the squad.
De Bruyne is rewarded with a place in the team having topped the Premier League assist chart with 16 so far this season. He is joined in the lineup by his City teammates, striker Sergio Aguero and winger Riyad Mahrez.
Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is also in the team, which is completed by Tottenham attacker Son Heung-Min and Leicester forward Jamie Vardy, the Premier League's top goalscorer with 19 so far this season.
Manchester United have forward Marcus Rashford and right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka on the bench, as well as goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who has impressed on a season-long loan spell with Sheffield United.
The squad is completed by Wolves winger Adama Traore, Chelsea defender Mateo Kovacic, and Vardy's Leicester defensive colleague Caglar Soyuncu.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dutch coach Koeman admitted to hospital with heart problem</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amsterdam: Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman was admitted to hospital with a heart problem on Sunday, his agent told Dutch national broadcaster NOS.
The 57-year-old was taken from his home by ambulance but after surgical intervention was in a stable condition, his wife Bartina told De Telegraaf.
Koeman's agent Rob Jansen told NOS that the coach is expected to be released from hospital on Monday.
Koeman has been the Dutch coach for just over two years and helped the country to qualify for Euro 2020, which has been postponed to next year due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The former international defender, who as a player won the European Cup with both PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona, managed Everton before he took charge of his native country's national team.
Dutch international and Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum wished Koeman a quick recovery in a post on Twitter.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amsterdam: Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman was admitted to hospital with a heart problem on Sunday, his agent told Dutch national broadcaster NOS.
The 57-year-old was taken from his home by ambulance but after surgical intervention was in a stable condition, his wife Bartina told De Telegraaf.
Koeman's agent Rob Jansen told NOS that the coach is expected to be released from hospital on Monday.
Koeman has been the Dutch coach for just over two years and helped the country to qualify for Euro 2020, which has been postponed to next year due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The former international defender, who as a player won the European Cup with both PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona, managed Everton before he took charge of his native country's national team.
Dutch international and Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum wished Koeman a quick recovery in a post on Twitter.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Foxtel 'confident' it can fulfil under-represented sport obligations</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Foxtel is "confident" it can fulfil its under-represented sport obligations even though the COVID-19 pandemic has decimated sporting codes across the country.
The pay TV provider is required to broadcast under-represented sports such as women's football, basketball and soccer as part of a $30 million federal government grant.
The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications is due to assess Foxtel's 12-month performance in July. The government will then determine whether the News Corp-owned broadcaster will be eligible for the grant's final instalment of $7.5 million.
Coronavirus has disrupted almost a quarter of this year's sporting calendar. Major codes such as the AFL and NRL right through to softball and lawn bowls have all been affected. But Fox Sports boss Peter Campbell is confident Foxtel will pass the government's final assessment because the broadcaster had not only met but exceeded the 2019-20 benchmarks prior to COVID-19 shutdowns.
"Fox Sports has worked hard over the past year to produce, televise and build audiences for women's and under-represented sport in Australia, which have struggled to secure coverage on free-to-air television," he said.
"The careers of many athletes in under-represented sports, particularly female athletes, have flourished as a result of the coverage."
Some critics have argued the federal government should have distributed the $30 million grant to public broadcasters so Australians can view such sports free of charge. However Mr Campbell said Foxtel was "uniquely placed" to boost coverage of niche and emerging sports thanks to eight dedicated 24-hour channels as well as its ties to streaming platform Kayo.
"Obviously COVID-19 is impacting all sport at present," he said. "We are confident that women's and under-represented sport will be back and we can deliver strongly against the requirements of the grant again for 2020-21."
An injection of $7.5 million would provide some relief for Foxtel's balance sheet. The company has undergone three rounds of job cuts this year and has been offering customers significant discounts to compensate for the loss of live sport. The company has also sought a multimillion-dollar discount for the resumed NRL season.
A spokesman from the Communications department said the government would review Foxtel's latest expenditure breakdown, as well as its plan for the new financial year, in the coming months.
"The department will make an assessment as to the basis for payment following receipt of these reports," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Serie A clubs given all-clear to resume training</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Serie A clubs can welcome players back to their training grounds from Monday after being given the go-ahead by the Italian government.
A decree issued by the Emilia-Romagna region on Thursday opened the door for Sassuolo, SPAL, Bologna and Parma to train from May 4. On Saturday, Sassuolo became the first team to confirm they would return to training.
Roma followed in their footsteps, and now the rest of the teams in Italy's top flight can prepare for a potential resumption of the season following a government decree that permits players to train individually at their clubs, respecting social distancing rules.
The Clubs and Players' Association had argued it was safer to run inside a training ground than in local parks, as social distancing can be guaranteed.
A statement from Italy's Home Office read: "On the basis of a systematic reading of the various provisions, supported by a shared orientation in the inter-ministerial forum, it is believed that sport activities are allowed for individual athletes, both professional and non-professional, of non-individual disciplines, like every citizen, in public or private areas, respecting the interpersonal safety distance of at least two metres and respecting the prohibition of any form of assembly."
The decree will be in force until May 17, the day Italy's lockdown measures expire.
The 2019-20 Serie A season has been suspended since March due to the COVID-19 crisis, which has seen over 28,000 people die in Italy.
Juventus are top of Serie A, the defending champions leading Lazio by a point.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Serie A players set to resume training on Monday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rome/Berlin: Serie A clubs are in limbo with several regions of Italy allowing players to begin practicing on an individual basis at training centres on Monday while the government has set a May 18 return to the practice field for teams.
Sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora is seeking clarification from the government’s techno-scientific coronavirus commission.
Emilia-Romagna, Campania, Lazio and Sardinia have each given the go-ahead for teams in their regions to begin individual training. Those regions contain eight Serie A clubs: Bologna, Sassuolo, Spal, Parma, Napoli, Lazio, Roma and Cagliari.
Serie A has been suspended since March 9, when the government ordered a nationwide lockdown.
The government announced a week ago that individual athletes can resume training on May 4, while teams can restart May 18.
Meanwhile, Germany’s minister for interior Horst Seehofer has supported the proposed day for resumption of football in the country. German Football League (DFL) Chief Executive Christian Seifert had earlier said they are hoping to restart league football in the country on May 9 provided they get the green light from the government.
Seehofer stated he finds the proposal ‘plausible’ considering all the requisite government guidelines are followed by the officials and players.
“I find the schedule proposed by the German league plausible and I support the restart in May,” Horst Seehofer was quoted as saying by Bild.
“If there is a case of coronavirus in a team or its management, the club as a whole, and eventually also the team against which it last played, must go into quarantine for two weeks.
“There will continue therefore to be risks for the schedule of matches and for the classification, if there is any contamination,” he added.
The entire sporting calender of the world has been shredded due to coronavirus pandemic and football is no different.
Leagues in Netherlands, Belgium and France have been called off while other nations like England, Italy, Spain and Germany are battling hard to salvage their respective seasons.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Regional government allows Napoli to resume training</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Napoli were on Saturday given the green light to restart training next week by regional authorities as Serie A clubs eye a return to action from the coronavirus pandemic shutdown.
The Campania region, where Napoli are based, said in a statement that "the region's positive ruling has already be sent to the government", adding that it had asked for an OK as soon as possible "in order to enable training to restart on Monday".
Campania is the second region in Italy to allow its local Serie A club to recommence preparations, under strict health guidelines, at their training ground after Emilia-Romagna made a similar ruling on Friday for Bologna, Parma, SPAL and Sassuolo.
Lazio, which hosts the Rome-based club of the same name and city rivals Roma, Hellas Verona's home the Veneto and Sardinia, where Cagliari are based, are expected to follow suit.
The announcement comes despite a government decree which stops players from training at their locked-off sports centres where social distancing could be guaranteed, but allows them to run in public parks.
Italy is preparing to relax its lockdown on Monday as the Covid-19 numbers continue a positive trend. The virus has killed over 28 000 people in the country. Many regions have had a fraction of the number of deaths experienced by Lombardy and Piedmont in the north.
On Friday, Serie A unanimously voted to finish the 2019-20 season, suspended since 9 March.
However, Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora this week said the chances of restarting were "increasingly narrow". He also vowed to ensure that football's finances would be "damaged as little as possible" should the season be declared over.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man Utd star Marcus Rashford tipped to fight Kylian Mbappe for Ballon d'Or</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rashford has been backed to take on Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappe for future Ballon d'Or awards by former teammate Matteo Darmian.
Mbappe, 21, is arguably the most exciting up-and-coming prospect in Europe thanks to his explosive performances for PSG and France - who he spearheaded to victory at the 2018 World Cup.
The former Monaco man picked up the award for the Best Young Player at the tournament and he has continued to shine on the big stage, scoring or assisting 10 goals in seven appearances in this season's Champions League.
But Darmian - who spent four years training with Rashford before moving to Serie A club Parma last summer - believes the England international has what it takes to challenge Mbappe.
"I still remember Marcus Rashford's first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday," Darmian told The Guardian. "I immediately thought: 'Wow, this is an incredible player.'
"He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me. If he continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d'Or winner.
"I'm convinced of this. He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he's very young and can still improve. For me he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappe and compete for the Ballon d'Or for years to come."
Mbappe finished sixth in the 2019 Ballon d'Or voting while Rashford was not among the 30 nominees.
However, the Red Devils academy product was enjoying an excellent 2019/20 season before suffering a serious back injury in January.
The 22-year-old scored 19 goals and provided five assists in all competitions and is expected to be fit for when the season resumes as the coronavirus pandemic eases.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rashford can compete with Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe for the Ballon d'Or in the future, according to former Manchester United defender Matteo Darmian.
Darmian spent four years alongside Rashford at Old Trafford before moving to Serie A side Parma at the start of the season.

The Italy international, who won the Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup at United, said Rashford can go right to the very top.
"I still remember Marcus Rashford's first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday," he told The Guardian. "I immediately thought: 'Wow, this is an incredible player.'
"He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me. If he continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d'Or winner.
"I'm convinced of this. He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he's very young and can still improve. For me he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappe and compete for the Ballon d'Or for years to come."
Mbappe, ranked ESPN's No.1 player aged 21 or under, finished sixth in the 2019 Ballon d'Or final voting while Rashford was not on the list of nominees.
Darmian also said that United midfielder Paul Pogba receives a lot of criticism despite being a positive influence in the dressing room.
"There has been a lot of unjustified criticism towards Pogba, for example that he doesn't work hard enough, but he always gave his best, I can assure you, in every training session," he added.
"In my opinion his performances were good in recent years, they talk about him too negatively [in the UK].
"Did I see Pogba unhappy or willing to leave? No, I honestly didn't see him sad or unhappy, quite the opposite, for all the time I was in Manchester, Paul was absolutely happy with his decision to go back there. He really cares about doing well at Manchester United."
Pogba said he has been "frustrated" this season due to his injury problems this season but is ready to return stronger.
Sources have told ESPN United are optimistic he will remain at the club beyond the next transfer window before the sport was halted by the coronavirus pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ronaldo was 'breathtaking' after World Cup - Neville</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gary Neville says Cristiano Ronaldo returned from the 2006 Soccer World Cup in Germany a far improved player.
The Red Devils signed Ronaldo from Sporting Lisbon for £12.25 million in 2003 and the Portugal international enjoyed six successful years at Old Trafford before moving on to Real Madrid in 2009.
Now at Juventus, Ronaldo has amassed an incredible array of team and individual honours, including five Champions League titles and five Ballon d'Or awards.
Neville told The Football Show on Sky Sports: "He was incredibly driven. I knew him more professionally than personally but his drive was out of this world.
"He was one of the few players that would announce that individual trophies were important to him. Most would say the team is more important but he would say 'I want to be the best player in the world because in turn it would help my team'. He wanted to be the very, very best in the world and what he’s done over many years is exceptional.
"It's an obsession with scoring goals, applying himself every day, being the fittest he could be. He's lifted his standards every year. I've got no doubt he will want to continue playing and overtake Pele’s numbers. He wants to be the greatest of all time and understanding along the way that the teams he plays in will be successful.
"In that 2006/07 season. He was breathtaking. He had fire in his belly, hunger. It went from wanting to give up on him in those first few years to when it started to happen after the 2006 World Cup.
"When you look at the season it was when all the negative aspects of his game just disappeared. When a player starts getting 30 goals and 15 or 20 assists you can put up with anything from them. It was match after match after match and in a two-year period I’ve never seen anything like it on a pitch at Old Trafford.
"It's very rare you can say you've had the best player in the world bar none and I think we did that season. Sir Alex and Carlos Queiroz both championed him and believed in him. He came back from the 2006 World Cup and his maturity had changed. His appearance and physical attributes completely changed overnight.
"He was scrawny, wiry and not very strong and then all of a sudden he was a super middleweight boxer. He was incredible from a strength point of view and the ability to leap, change direction, everything fell into place. From that moment on you knew he was going to be really special."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Inter could offer classy midfield ace in player exchange deal for Man Utd superstar</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Inter are reportedly now also interested in Man Utd midfielder Paul Pogba, and a swap deal has been touted from Antonio Conte to seal a reunion with his former star.
The pair enjoyed a successful stint together at Juventus previously, before Pogba returned to Man Utd and Conte went on to take the Italy job.

It’s been an indifferent time for the French International in his second stint at Old Trafford as while it’s been successful in terms of winning a few trophies, he has largely been inconsistent on an individual level and has made just eight appearances so far this season due to injury.
While the Red Devils appear to be moving in the fight direction under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and were certainly in impressive form prior to the suspension of the campaign, many will surely be intrigued to see how Pogba fits into the current line-up and links up with the likes of Bruno Fernandes to try and take Man Utd to the next level.
However, as noted by Football Italia, via RAI Sport, it’s suggested that while Juventus have their own plans to try and prise Pogba back to Turin, they could now face competition from bitter rivals Inter for his signature.
It’s added that the Nerazzurri could be willing to include Marcelo Brozovic as part of a player swap deal, with a significant fee likely to still be needed to convince Man Utd to green light an exit.
It’s questionable timing given the Croatian international has been a fundamental part of Conte’s plans so far this season, scoring three goals and providing five assists in 32 appearances. That wouldn’t suggest that the Italian tactician is willing to sacrifice him to get Pogba, but time will tell if that’s enough coupled with cash to persuade United to allow their superstar midfielder to move on for a second time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jonjo Shelvey tipped for Barcelona transfer - if he can change his ways</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jonjo Shelvey's Newcastle United teammate Matt Ritchie says the midfielder could play for Barcelona, if only his head was screwed on.
England international Shelvey, who has been capped six times but never since 2015, is in his fifth season at St James' Park and has delivered several standout displays for Steve Bruce's side across the campaign.
And Ritchie says the former Liverpool midfielder's ability is beyond question.
"What a player, I've been at Newcastle four years and I've seen him inside a box no more than 10 times," Scotland international Ritchie told the In The Box YouTube channel.
"That's how good he is. His natural ability to see passes, to receive the ball, to move the ball.
"I remember playing against him as a kid - I think he scored a hat-trick, he was unbelievable.
"He's got his moves - ending up at Newcastle. I say to him on regular occasions: 'if you had your head screwed on you could play for Barcelona.'
"He's that good. He's got everything."
Ritchie adds Shelvey's love of golf is one of the reasons he hasn't reached his potential as a footballer.
"I've said to him so many times 'if you just got head down and focused just solely on football and forget about golf and whatever else...'," he added.
"He's mad - he'll play golf like three times a week.
"I'm like 'Jonjo, you can't do that.'
"At Newcastle, he hits the longer passes, he's the one we look to open teams up and create - I feel like, and this is no disrespect to us at Newcastle, but if he was playing at Barcelona or Real Madrid, you can just imagine...he would just blow teams away with his ability.
"You have to have everything in the right place and he likes his golf too much!"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jonjo Shelvey could play for Barcelona 'so easily', claims Newcastle team-mate</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jonjo Shelvey is talented enough to play for Barcelona and would "blow teams away", according to Newcastle United team-mate Matt Ritchie.
Shelvey, who won the last of his six England caps in 2015, is a key man at Newcastle, having joined the club from Swansea City in 2016 after struggling to establish himself at Liverpool.
The midfielder had joined Liverpool from Charlton Athletic in 2010 as an 18-year-old.
But winger Ritchie claims Shelvey could be turning out for Barca or Real Madrid if he had the desire to focus on his game.
The ex-Bournemouth man revealed "mad" Shelvey instead plays golf for Northumberland and takes to the course three times a week.
Ritchie told the In The Box podcast: "For me, I've said to him so many times, 'If you just got your head down, focused solely on football and forgot about golf and whatever else...'
"It's true, though, isn't it? He's mad. He'll play golf three times a week, and I'm like, 'Jonj, you can't do that'. He's like, 'No, no, I feel better, Matty'. I'm like, 'That's impossible'.
"But what a player, what a player. I've been at Newcastle now for four years, and I've honestly seen him inside a box [rondo] no more than 10 times. That's how good he is - and we do boxes every day.
"This guy has the natural ability to just see passes, to receive the ball, to move the ball.
"I remember playing against him as a kid. I think he was 14 - we were playing Charlton Under-16s at Portsmouth - and I think he scored a hat-trick. He was unbelievable.
"Obviously, he's got his moves and he's ended up at Newcastle. But I say to him very regular: 'Jonj, if you had your head screwed on, you could play for Barcelona so easily.'
"He's that good, isn't he? He is, though. He's that good.
"He's got everything, he's got the short one, and at Newcastle now, he hits longer passes and tougher passes and he's the one we look to to open teams up and create.
"But - and this is no disrespect to us at Newcastle - I feel like if he was playing for a Barcelona or Real Madrid, you could imagine he'd blow teams away with his ability.
"You've got to have everything in the right place, and he likes his golf too much, doesn't he?
"He says to me, 'I know Matty, but this is what I'm like, this is what I'm like'. Imagine if you wanted to. You could."
Shelvey, who earned the last of his six England caps in 2015, is Newcastle's top scorer in the Premier League this season with five goals from midfield.
The 28-year-old has been criticised for a lack of discipline in the past and was sent off twice in the 2017-18 campaign, having led the Magpies to promotion from the Championship the previous season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Manchester United teammate of Solskjaer reveals Sir Alex Ferguson inspiration</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is trying to restore the identity Manchester United had under Sir Alex Ferguson, according to a former teammate of the Norwegian at Old Trafford.
Andy Cole had great success under Ferguson, winning five Premier League titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League, and he had a good relationship with Solskjaer during their playing days.
The former Old Trafford forward doesn't see too many managerial similarities between Solskjaer and the legendary Scot, other than the current United manager's desire to restore traditions to the club that have been lost in recent years.
Ferguson's fiery side was no secret during his time at United, and while Cole only ever saw the smiling, friendly Solskjaer, he is intrigued to hear that his former teammate might have a ruthless streak in him too.
"I think Ole is trying to implement what Sir Alex always had in the way we play, managerial style, I’m not so sure," Cole said.
"I’ve heard he’s got a little nasty streak in him, but in all my years playing with Ole I never saw that so it would be interesting to see.
"Management is not an easy role, he’s come in and he’s tried to do the right thing, which is important. He’s tried to take Manchester United back to what Manchester United were.
"Ultimately he’s trying to bring United back to how they play, by playing good football."
Cole, who was speaking to the MEN as he launched the Andy Cole Fund, a fundraising initiative aimed at helping patients with their mental health and wellbeing after kidney transplants, believes United had badly lost their way since Ferguson's retirement in 2013.
For over two decades United were associated with quick, attacking football under Ferguson, but that was an identity that was eroded as the club searched for the right formula following his departure.
"When you have an identity, whoever comes into that club should not be trying to change it," Cole said. "If you work for Apple, Steve Jobs is no longer with us, but whoever replaces him hasn’t tried to change the identity of the company.
"It’s like Barcelona, everybody knows how they play, so a manager can’t come in and change that, it’s about continuity, now Ole is trying to bring that back, which is the most important thing."
Once the experiment with David Moyes had failed within a season United were searching for an answer post-Ferguson, one Cole believes they may only be finding now they have appointed one of his former players.
Louis van Gaal followed Moyes and won the FA Cup, while Jose Mourinho won the Europa League and the League Cup, but neither could sustain a title challenge, while the approach drifted away from the exhilarating attacking seen under Ferguson, often to a more pragmatic game.
"They went away from that [style]," added Cole. "Moyes came in and changed the way we play, van Gaal came in and changed the way we play, Mourinho came in and changed the way we play.
"But United only know one way to play, that’s galvanizing football, get the fans off their seats, and have a good go. To see that from Sir Alex Ferguson, to see managers change it and now Ole bring it back to what it was, it’s great."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Daniel James' four football idols and the Man Utd team-mate who left him feeling 'weird' after Swansea City move</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United star Daniel James has revealed his four footballing icons - including one he is currently playing with.
James moved to Old Trafford from Swansea City last summer in a transfer deal that could eventually be worth £18million.
His stunning displays for Swansea under Graham Potter last term made him a much sought-after prospect, and when United came calling it was inevitable that the winger would move up to the Premier League.
His impact with the Red Devils has been impressive - having initially been signed as one for the future, he has featured regularly under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer this season.
One particular player, though, made him particularly welcome when he arrived from the Liberty last June. And that is Juan Mata.
Asked about his footballing idols growing up, James said: "I've got quite a few.
"I think everyone looks up to (Lionel) Messi but I think I've got to go Juan as someone I always looked up to and to play with him now is surreal for me.
"(Eden) Hazard is one, Thierry Henry, unbelievable. So yeah, I'd go them."
Around the same time as James moved to Old Trafford, he suffered the unbearable loss of his father, putting Mata's words of comfort into even better focus.
Pressed further on the Spaniard's inclusion amongst his footballing greats, James added: "I think just what he did, so graceful on the pitch and I remember I got one of his shirts, Europa League shirts, when he won it at Chelsea.
"He is just someone who I always looked up to. To play in the same team is just surreal for me. I think when I first met him it was just a bit weird. Growing up as a kid, looking up to someone and then end up playing with them. Not just being great on the pitch but off the pitch as well, someone that obviously inspire me a lot.
"I think when I first met him he came and sat next to me in the changing room and he said 'I know it is a big move for you, if you need anything here is my number. If you ever need a message, or someone to talk to I'll be here'. That was great for me."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul Merson names Man United’s most exciting player and hails two youngsters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paul Merson says Bruno Fernandes is the Manchester United player who excites him most and has hailed young prospects Mason Greenwood and Brandon Williams.
Fernandes completed a £68million move to Old Trafford in January and the former Sporting midfielder has quickly established himself as a fans’ favourite at United.
The 25-year-old scored three goals and made four assists in his first eight appearances for Manchester United and Merson says he could develop into one of the club’s ‘most important acquisitions in recent years’.
‘Manchester United made good signings last summer bringing in Harry Maguire, Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka. But it’s Bruno Fernandes who really excites me,’ Merson wrote in a column for StarSport.
‘The £47m buy from Sporting Lisbon looks tailor-made for United and could prove to be one of the club’s most important acquisitions in recent years.
‘He hit the ground running, seamlessly slotting into midfield and playing with the confidence and authority of someone who’d been there for years.
‘It’s no coincidence that United’s form improved dramatically when Fernandes came in.’
Manchester United were only fifth in the Premier League when the 2019-20 season was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic but Merson feels the Red Devils are in a ‘really good place’.
And the former Arsenal and England star has been impressed by striker Greenwood and defender Williams who have broke into the team over the past 12 months.
‘No-one is enjoying the lack of football right now but I feel United are in a really good place,’ Merson added.
‘All of a sudden, no-one is speculating about Solskjaer’s position and the club is getting good publicity again.
‘There’s talk of Jadon Sancho moving there in the summer, perhaps Harry Kane too.
‘Kids such as Mason Greenwood and Brandon Williams look really good players while of course Marcus Rashford, who was going great guns before his injury, will be fit again fairly soon.’

Brighton & Hove Albion are opposed to the idea of playing the remaining 2019/2020 English Premier League games at neutral venues, according to their chief executive Paul Barber.
The season has been suspended since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
But, as discussions continue about the resumption of matches, clubs have been told that only approved neutral venues will be allowed.
Brighton, 15th in the standings, have five home games left – including visits from Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal.
“At this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition,” Barber told the club’s website.
“Five of our nine remaining matches are due to be played at the Amex. All five matches are very difficult, but four are against some of the biggest clubs in European football.”
Barber said although his club were willing to make compromises, such as playing in empty stadiums, to complete the season, they were not ready to surrender home advantage.
“Clearly, we must accept there may also be some benefit from playing our remaining four away matches at neutral venues but the fixture list simply isn’t equally balanced at this stage of the season,” he added.
“We didn’t play our first 29 matches of the season in this way. So, in our opinion one thing doesn’t cancel out the other.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brighton not in favour of finishing Premier League season at neutral venues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brighton have broken ranks and admitted they are not in favour of finishing the Premier League season at neutral venues.
Top-flight clubs met yesterday to continue to thrash out plans to complete the campaign during the coronavirus crisis.
Brighton, who are battling relegation, have been mentioned as one of ten stadia which could be used but with no club playing at home.
But the club's CEO Paul Barber has said he is not in favour of playing the remaining nine games away from home.
“We haven’t been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches - by our colleagues at the league, the government, or the police – and at this point we haven’t been approached to have such a discussion either so I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports," he said in a statement.
"We do of course understand that in the very difficult circumstances we are facing that every option must be considered – but that should only be when safe to do so for all concerned and, if and when we reach that point, we are not in favour of playing our remaining matches at neutral venues.
"Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government’s efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus. But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition.
"Five of our nine remaining matches due to be played at the Amex – all five matches are very difficult but four are against some of the biggest clubs in European football.
"The disadvantages of us not playing the league’s top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious.
"Clearly, we must accept there may also be some benefit from playing our remaining four away matches at neutral venues but the fixture list simply isn’t equally balanced at this stage of the season, and we didn’t play our first 29 matches of the season in this way. So, in our opinion one thing doesn’t cancel out the other.
"Our income and with it many jobs and livelihoods in our industry at all levels of the game relies on us finding a way to re-start matches at the earliest possible opportunity, but safety and fairness for all concerned are paramount."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Antonio Brown posts photo of himself in Ravens jersey on social media</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Could wide receiver Antonio Brown finally have a new home?
Brown is still currently a free agent, and if you’ve followed the All-Pro wideout over the last two years, it’s obvious he’s had his share of legal concerns.
But, Brown made social media headlines once again Saturday when he posted an edited picture of himself on Snapchat in a Baltimore Ravens uniform.
Brown and a cousin, second-year wideout Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, the Ravens first-round pick of the 2019 draft, have worked out together since the end of last season. Reigning NFL MVP Lamar Jackson also joined in on at least one of those workouts.
A few weeks after a video emerged showing them working out, a reporter asked Jackson about the opportunity of Brown playing in Baltimore, and Jackson seemed to be intrigued by the idea of having Brown as another weapon in their already potent offense.
EAGLES' GM: TEAM 'MARRIED' TO QB CARSON WENTZ
"I'd be happy if they signed him," Jackson said of Brown, as NBC Sports Washington reported. "He's a great player. He showed it each and every year when he was with the Steelers in the past, but it's not my decision."
Brown has been facing felony burglary conveyance, misdemeanor battery and misdemeanor criminal mischief charges over a Jan. 21 incident in which he and his trainer allegedly assaulted a truck driver outside his Hollywood, Fla., home over a money dispute, ESPN reported, citing Broward County court documents from Mar. 20.

Brown has not played in the league since September. He previously played for the Pittsburgh Steelers before joining the Oakland Raiders in the off-season. He did not play any regular-season games for the Raiders and was released following a turbulent offseason.
The New England Patriots then picked him up, but he played only one game before the team released him after 11 days in the wake of the sexual-assault allegations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Antonio Brown Posts Image Of Himself Wearing A Different Team’s Uniform</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The past year for Antonio Brown has been a roller-coaster ride to say the least. Although things regarding the former All-Pro wideout were relatively quiet in recent weeks, he’s once again stirring up controversy.
On Saturday afternoon, Brown posted a photoshopped image of himself wearing a Baltimore Ravens jersey on Snapchat. He took the post down after several fans screenshot it.
As of right now, the Ravens don’t have any intentions of signing Brown to a contract. Besides, the front office just added a pair of wide receivers to their offense last week during the 2020 NFL Draft in Devin Duvernay and James Proche.
What makes this potential pairing between Brown and the Ravens so fascinating is that his cousin, Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, was drafted by the team last year. Earlier this offseason, the two were seen working out with Lamar Jackson.
Baltimore doesn’t need to add more weapons to its current offense. However, adding Brown would give him the chance to face Pittsburgh twice next season. That alone would make for quite the story.
Since the NFL hasn’t made a final decision on Brown and if he’ll be suspended, the Pro Bowl wideout will probably remain on the open market.
When he’s on the field, there might not be a wide receiver better than Brown. The downside here is that he comes with a lot of baggage.
Do you think we’ll see Brown playing in the NFL this fall?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Antonio Brown Posts Himself Photoshopped In Ravens Jersey, Sparks Rumors (PIC)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After being turned away from playing on the Tampa Bay Bucs — Antonio Brown has seemingly found the team he wants to play for in 2020.
After the Ravens GM didn’t entirely close the door on the franchise signing him, the free agent WR took to Snapchat and posted himself photoshopped in a Ravens jersey.
Brown recently made waves when he worked out with his cousin, Ravens receiver Hollywood Brown, and the team’s superstar quarterback, 2019 NFL MVP Lamar Jackson.
Jackson even told reporters he’d be “happy” Baltimore signed Antonio Brown.
Brown hasn’t been on an NFL roster since last September, when the New England Patriots released him amid sexual-assault allegations. His tenure with the team only lasted eleven days.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NFL general manager: QB Joe Burrow is 'Alex Smith-like'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After a stellar season leading LSU to a national championship, quarterback Joe Burrow was the presumptive No. 1 overall selection in the 2020 NFL Draft. Once Cincinnati made it clear that it was in need of change at the position, Burrow to the Bengals quickly became a reality.
Many draft experts had Burrow as the clear-cut top pick, and it was an easy choice because of his talent. But there’s at least one general manager in the league who isn’t convinced that Burrow will be the next superstar at the position.
CAM NEWTON WILL NOT ACCEPT JOB AS BACKUP QB, REPORT SAYS
One general manager, speaking anonymously, compared Burrow to Washington Redskins quarterback Alex Smith, who was drafted No. 1 overall by the San Francisco 49ers in the 2005 draft.
“I have concerns,” the GM told The Athletic. “He does not have a lot of power or strength in his arm at all. He is a one-year producer. Love the brain, like the short accuracy. He is Alex Smith-like, and Alex was the No. 1 pick in the draft, nothing wrong with that.”
ANDY DALTON, COWBOYS AGREE TO 1-YEAR DEAL, TEAM ANNOUNCES
During his senior season, Burrow put up passing numbers that will go down as some of the best in college football history. He completed 76.3 percent of his passes for 5,671 yards, 60 touchdowns and six interceptions, and even rushed for 368 yards and five more scores.
Burrow and Smith are very comparable when it comes to their size. Burrow is 6-foot-4 and 221 pounds, while Smith is 6-foot-4 and 213 pounds. And they are both stealthy athletes, which allows them to make plays with their legs regularly.
There’s no doubt that Smith has had a solid NFL career, but if Burrow ends up having a similar career, the Bengals will be disappointed. Smith’s career is very comparable to former Bengals starter Andy Dalton, who was released by the team on Thursday and signed with the Dallas Cowboys two days later. Dalton took the Bengals to the playoffs five times, but he never won a playoff game.

Cincinnati is hoping that Burrow will develop into an elite-level quarterback. Former Bengals signal-callers Ken Anderson, Boomer Esiason, and Dalton were all very good players, but they never entered the elite category at the position. The Bengals are hoping Burrow can be that guy who takes them to that next level.

    <h5 class="mb-1">REPORT: AFC Evaluator ‘Worried’ Patriots Tanking for Trevor Lawrence in 2021 NFL Draft</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When it comes to the New England Patriots in the post-Tom Brady era, everyone seems to have an opinion about what the franchise is going to do going forward.
According to one anonymous AFC evaluator, per The Athletic’s Mike Sando, the Patriots could tank for Clemson QB Trevor Lawrence, who is expected to be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft.
“I’m a little worried that they are tanking for Trevor Lawrence,” an AFC evaluator said in a story that gave thoughts on each team post draft.
Most other evaluators believe the Patriots actually like Stidham in the starting role and won’t go after any of the free agent quarterbacks.
Another added: “The takeaway is, they like Stidham and they believe he is the next guy, but he is going to compete with Hoyer. Does bringing in Dalton work well in a shortened year? Would he come in, learn their offense and be ahead of Hoyer, who has been in it before? I don’t see it.”
Lawrence has passed for 6,711 yards, 66 touchdowns and 12 inceptions in two seasons along with nine rushing scores. He has led the Clemson Tigers to back-to-back appearances in the title game, winning the College Football Playoff Championship in one of them.
You can never count out the Patriots while Bill Belichick is still there.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joe Burrow Draws Negative Comparison To Alex Smith From One NFL GM</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Oliver VanDervoort
Joe Burrow might have officially replaced Andy Dalton as the Cincinnati Bengals’ starter but there is at least on NFL GM who isn’t convinced the rookie quarterback is all he’s cracked up to be. In fact, according to a recent story from Mike Chiari of Bleacher Report says that GM believes Burrow is similar to another first-round quarterback in Alex Smith. The same GM believes there are reasons to be “concerned” about just what the Bengals’ rookie quarterback is going to be able to do in the NFL.
“I have concerns. He does not have a lot of power or strength in his arm at all. He is a one-year producer. Love the brain, like the short accuracy. He is Alex Smith-like, and Alex was the No. 1 pick in the draft,” Chiari said the anonymous general manager told Mike Sando of The Athletic in a recent interview.
The anonymous isn’t the first to raise concerns about Burrow’s arm, but even it he doesn’t have a cannon, he’s found a way to make the most of his strength. Last season, his second with LSU he completed an unheard-of 76.3 percent of his passes for 5,671 yards and 60 touchdowns. He threw just six interceptions. The year before, after transferring from Ohio State, his numbers weren’t nearly as gaudy but he still threw for nearly 3,000 yards and 16 touchdowns to just five interceptions.
Burrow is also a mobile quarterback, running for over 300 yards both seasons. He added 12 touchdowns combined on the ground in 2018 and 2019.
Alex Smith also had very good numbers in his college days. In fact, his final two years with Utah were somewhat similar to Burrow’s; if not as eye-popping. His sophomore year, Smith threw for over 2,200 yards, 15 touchdowns, and just three interceptions. The next season, he threw for just under 3,000 yards and 32 touchdowns to just four interceptions.
As Chiari points out, the big difference between what Burrow did at LSU and what Smith did at Utah is the quality of opponents. Utah had not yet joined the Pac 12 and was instead in the mid-level Mountain West. The level of talent in the SEC is good enough that the conference set a record for the number of players taken in the first round from member schools in the 2020 NFL Draft.
Chiari also pointed out Smith has had a successful career in the NFL, including three Pro-Bowl appearances. He also posited that if Burrow has the same kind of career Smith had, it would be considered a disappointment for the Bengals.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Patriots Player Thinks The Team Made Decision On Starting QB</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Once the New England Patriots officially lost Tom Brady in free agency, the majority of fans assumed they’d find his replacement in the 2020 NFL Draft. That wasn’t the case though, as Bill Belichick didn’t use any of this year’s picks on a quarterback.
There were rumors about the Patriots having interest in Jacob Eason and Jake Fromm. Then, rumors began to swirl about the team potentially tanking for Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence, the projected No. 1 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft.
According to former Patriots offensive lineman Rich Ohrnberger, the team already has its quarterback of the future on its roster. He believes Jarrett Stidham isn’t a placeholder or bridge quarterback. Instead, he thinks the Auburn product will be New England’s starter for years to come.
“I’ve heard it now from A LOT of people close to the Patriots. They really believe in Jarrett Stidham,” Ohrnberger said. “Like it or not, Stidham is not a cheap placeholder…he’s the future.”
Prior to his final season at Auburn, the majority of scouts had a first-round grade for Stidham. The offense didn’t live up to expectations, which then caused the talented quarterback’s draft stock to fall.
Assuming that Stidham does win the starting job in New England, he’ll be tasked with replacing one of the greatest quarterbacks of all-time. That’s a heavy burden for any athlete, let alone a second-year player.
Only time will tell if the Patriots trust Stidham to be the next face of the franchise, but all signs point to him being the starter when Week 1 of the regular season arrives.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It is not an easy task playing for New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, and a former teammate of quarterback Tom Brady believes that’s why the future Hall of Famer left to play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Former Patriots cornerback Asante Samuel said that he believes Brady got “fed up” in New England.

“He probably just got tired of it,” Samuel told TMZ Sports. “He probably got tired of some inner circle things that he wanted, that he wanted receivers and tight ends to stay there with him and maybe Bill (Belichick) tried to trade them. Who knows what happened. You know, he probably just got fed up with it at the end of the day.”
Samuel, who was with the Patriots from 2003-2007, admitted that playing for the team made him a better person, but his time with the team wasn’t fun.

“It’s a one-of-a-kind situation. It worked out for me, man. It made me a better man, but it’s not something I enjoyed,” Samuel said. “Everyone wants to do stuff they love and enjoy. I think that’s the one thing that probably most people will say. You know, some people might say you’re not here to enjoy sh-t. That might be The Patriot Way, but I do things my way.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Bucs QB Coach Weighs In On Jameis Winston’s NFL Future</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jameis Winston made the gutsy decision to take a deal with the New Orleans Saints as a backup for 2020.
But Winston’s supporters don’t seem to think that he’ll be riding the bench for long. In a recent interview, former Bucs QBs coach Mike Bajakian believes that Winston will be “back on track” soon.
Bajakian explained to Lance Medow on Mad Dog Sports Radio on Sirius XM that while he was in Tampa Bay, he saw a level of competitiveness, intelligence and ability in Winston that makes him an ideal quarterback. He conceded that the interceptions were a problem, but believes Winston is a player you can build around.
Bajakian was the Bucs QBs coach for Winston’s first four years under former Lovie Smith and Dirk Koetter. The Bucs went 21-33 during those years, but Winston averaged over 4,000 yards, 25 touchdowns and 17 interceptions per 16 games.
Via 247Sports:
But despite leading the NFL in passing yards this past year, Winston was not re-signed after the season. The Bucs signed Tom Brady to a big contract instead.
Now that he’s a member of the Saints, Winston may find starts hard to come by behind Drew Brees. But just as Teddy Bridgewater was able to parlay his chances into a new starting gig, Winston could find similar opportunities.
Did Jameis Winston make the right choice in joining the Saints?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Beware of a fired-up Tom Brady</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have a lot to learn about their new, future Hall of Fame quarterback. Most important: Don’t get in Tom Brady’s way on gameday, or he may knock you on your behind.
Former New England Patriots receiver Donte Stallworth once learned that the hard way in 2007, even after getting warned by then-running back Kevin Faulk.
“(Faulk) goes, ‘Stay away from Brady before we walk out,'” Stallworth told ESPN. “And he goes, ‘He’s gonna head-butt the s— out of you. He’s too fired up. Stay away from him, man.’
“I had kinda forgotten about it until he walked up to me and I’m like, ‘S— .’ And he like head-butts the hell out of me,” Stallworth said, “And I’m like, ‘This dude is like serious.’ I didn’t know that he was as competitive as he was. When people talk about [Michael] Jordan being as competitive as he was, that’s the same thing with Tom Brady.”
Brady, who will be 43 by his Buccaneers debut this coming season, gets revved up for games by engaging with fans and sometimes talking trash to the opposition. One game in particular stands out to Stallworth — the 2018 AFC Championship Game against the Jaguars, when notorious talker Jalen Ramsey got into it with Brady beforehand.
“And Tom’s giving it right back to him,” Stallworth said. “That’s who Brady is. I love to trash-talk, so when a quarterback does it, I’m like in love. … I’ve seen him get into it with Terrell Suggs and Ray Lewis — yelling and cussing at them and they’re yelling and cussing at him back. He loves that stuff.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">De Bruyne eyes swift return to action</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin De Bruyne believes Manchester City could resume training in a fortnight, that the Premier League will finish the season despite the coronavirus crisis and that his club’s European ban will be overturned.
REUTERS: Kevin De Bruyne believes Manchester City could resume training in a fortnight, that the Premier League will finish the season despite the coronavirus crisis and that his club’s European ban will be overturned.
The midfielder is also pleased Belgium coach Roberto Martinez has extended his contract and says he is not interested in a move.
The 28-year-old, speaking to Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws, predicted the Premier League season will be concluded unlike the campaigns in France, the Netherlands and his native Belgium.
"My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks," he said.
“The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give the people something, but it will be played without spectators I think.
“The financial aspect is far too important for the Premier League and if the season is not complete, it will cause serious problems.”
De Bruyne's Manchester City team mate Sergio Aguero said last week he was scared about returning.
"Gosh, I don't think they are really afraid for themselves, but for their families," De Bruyne said. “That is the problem for many people. Everyone will be tested once we start playing again.”
De Bruyne had been in excellent form before the suspension.
“When the league resumes, I don't really see it as an extension of the season. It feels more like the start of a new season," the Belgian international said.
"I have never stood still for so long in my career but I'm not making a big deal out of it. Greater powers are at work and whatever is said and decided, I will agree with."
On Manchester City’s ban from European club competition for the next two years due to breaches of financial fair play regulations, he said: “The club is appealing and have told us they are almost 100per cent sure that they are right. I trust the club.”
Martinez staying as coach of top-ranked Belgium was a logical move after the European Championship was postponed to next year, De Bruyne added.
“Maybe he would have gone off and done something different if the European Championship was played this year, but we have a project, which is far from complete. Stopping now would be weird.”
As to his own future, De Bruyne is very content at City.
“I play for one of the best teams in the world; I play in England, in my view, the best competition, and I like that," he said. "It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin De Bruyne believes Manchester City could resume training in a fortnight, that the Premier League will finish the season despite the coronavirus crisis and that his club’s European ban will be overturned.
The midfielder is also pleased Belgium coach Roberto Martinez has extended his contract and says he is not interested in a move.
The 28-year-old, speaking to Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws, predicted the Premier League season will be concluded unlike the campaigns in France, the Netherlands, and his native Belgium.
“My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks,” he said. “The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give the people something, but it will be played without spectators I think.
“The financial aspect is far too important for the Premier League and if the season is not complete, it will cause serious problems.”
De Bruyne’s Manchester City teammate Sergio Aguero said last week he was scared about returning.
“Gosh, I don’t think they are really afraid for themselves, but for their families,” De Bruyne said. “That is the problem for many people. Everyone will be tested once we start playing again.”
De Bruyne had been in excellent form before the suspension.
“When the league resumes, I don’t really see it as an extension of the season. It feels more like the start of a new season,” the Belgian international said.
“I have never stood still for so long in my career but I’m not making a big deal out of it. Greater powers are at work and whatever is said and decided, I will agree with.”
On Manchester City’s ban from European club competition for the next two years due to breaches of financial fair play regulations, he said: “The club is appealing and has told us they are almost 100% sure that they are right. I trust the club.”
Martinez staying as coach of top-ranked Belgium was a logical move after the European Championship was postponed to next year, De Bruyne added.
“Maybe he would have gone off and done something different if the European Championship was played this year, but we have a project, which is far from complete. Stopping now would be weird.”
As to his own future, De Bruyne is very content at City.
“I play for one of the best teams in the world; I play in England, in my view, the best competition, and I like that,” he said. “It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global season in 'embryo stage' for World Rugby chief Beaumont</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS: Newly re-elected World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said on Sunday (May 3) plans for a global season are in the early phases of discussion.
Former England captain Beaumont, 68, who beat ex-Argentina skipper Agustin Pichot to the position this weekend, said the coronavirus pandemic had encouraged the idea about northern and southern hemisphere campaigns aligning.
Reports in Britain's The Rugby Paper claim European sides and teams from countries such as World Cup winners South Africa could play at the same time of the year.
"These are very much in the embryo stage at the moment. People are talking because what has stimulated the debate is the position regarding this year," Beaumont said.
"The north go south in one month then immediately afterwards the sides would go north. We have to bear in mind that we have to take all stakeholders with us," he added.
Beaumont admitted to facing a challenge from various leagues, unions and domestic sides based in Europe.
"In the north we have to take the club game with you, we have to take the European game with us. We are in dialogue with all the stakeholders," he said.
"It's more problems in certain areas when you have more stakeholders."

"In the north we have to take the club game with you, we have to take the European game with us. We are in dialogue with all the stakeholders," he said.
"It's more problems in certain areas when you have more stakeholders."
The prospect of a united season includes a global Nations Championship competition, which was scrapped in June as the Six Nations were worried about potential relegation from the top level of the game.
Beaumont said the new tournament would have multiple layers allowing sides to move between the competitions.
"My job is hopefully to get consensus from everybody in the game. I do think there is an appetite from the Six Nations to look at the Nations Championship," Beaumont said.
"Within that you could have competitions with all the countries who play in those windows and sitting below that you would have a subsidiary competitions for the emerging nations so they could play at the same time in another competition.
"You could well have promotion and relegation into that," he added.
In his first press conference since his re-election, Beaumont said he would like to change eligibility rules to permit individuals to represent different nations despite having already featured for another.
"It would allow players who might have played in a sevens tournament, they might have played an odd game for a Tier 1 nation, to go back," the former lock said.
"I think it gives an opportunity to help certain countries who are limited in their player resources.
"It has to be signed off by the council and both unions but it would improve the competitiveness of a Rugby World Cup without a doubt," he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Football: Influential German minister backs Bundesliga restart this month</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN: Germany's minister for the interior and sport said Sunday (May 3) he supports a resumption of the country's football season this month despite three people testing positive for coronavirus at Bundesliga club Cologne.
"I find the schedule proposed by the German league plausible and I support the restart in May," Horst Seehofer told Bild newspaper, three days before a meeting of German authorities to discuss the issue.
The German Football League (DFL) backs matches resuming without spectators around mid-May, which would make it the first major European championship to make such a move.
The sports ministers of the 16 German states have also approved the DFL's plans.
Seehofer, who plays a key government role on the issue as he holds several portfolios, has emphasised that the teams and players must respect several conditions.
"If there is a case of coronavirus in a team or its management, the club as a whole, and possibly also the team against which it last played, must go into quarantine for two weeks," he said.
"There will continue therefore to be risks for the schedule of matches and for the standings," if there is any contamination.
But he said clubs would not have any special testing privileges denied to the rest of the population. Some sides had suggested carrying out frequent tests of their players as a preventative measure against the virus.
Germany had reported 162,496 cases of COVID-19 as of Sunday, but its death toll of 6,649 remains considerably lower than that of comparable European countries, which are home to the continent's other top football leagues.
'HEALTH IS PRIORITY'
In France, Paris Saint-Germain were declared Ligue 1 champions on Thursday after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced professional sport could not resume before September.
Meanwhile, English Premier League clubs on Friday reconfirmed their commitment to finish the season subject to coronavirus restrictions being lifted.
There are still 92 games remaining. They will be behind closed doors with neutral venues suggested.
Also on Friday Italy's 20 Serie A clubs reiterated their unanimous desire to complete the season despite sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora saying the chances of restarting were "increasingly narrow".
In Spain, La Liga is planning to start testing players for the coronavirus between Tuesday and Thursday next week, after which they would then be able to resume individual training programmes within 48 hours.
Clubs in Germany resumed training in early April while adhering to strict social distancing guidelines. However, the risk is still apparent.
Cologne announced on Friday three people had tested positive for the virus and were to be placed into a 14-day quarantine at home.
Cologne midfielder Birger Verstraete, whose partner suffers from a heart condition, said it was "strange" the club had not put the whole squad in quarantine following the tests, as suggested by Seehofer.
"It's not up to me to decide what to do in the Bundesliga but I can say my head is not in football" at the moment, he told Flemish TV station VTM. "The health of my family, of my partner is the priority."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Germany’s minister for the interior and sport said Sunday he supports a resumption of the country’s football season this month despite three people testing positive for coronavirus at Bundesliga club Cologne.
“I find the schedule proposed by the German league plausible and I support the restart in May,” Horst Seehofer told Bild newspaper, three days before a meeting of German authorities to discuss the issue.
The German Football League (DFL) backs matches resuming without spectators around mid-May, which would make it the first major European championship to make such a move.
The sports ministers of the 16 German states have also approved the DFL’s plans.
Seehofer, who plays a key government role on the issue as he holds several portfolios, has emphasised that the teams and players must respect several conditions.
“If there is a case of coronavirus in a team or its management, the club as a whole, and possibly also the team against which it last played, must go into quarantine for two weeks,” he said.
“There will continue therefore to be risks for the schedule of matches and for the standings,” if there is any contamination.
But he said clubs would not have any special testing privileges denied to the rest of the population. Some sides had suggested carrying out frequent tests of their players as a preventative measure against the virus.
Germany had reported more than 162,000 cases of Covid-19 as of Sunday, but its death toll of 6,649 remains considerably lower than that of comparable European countries, which are home to the continent’s other top football leagues.
In France, Paris Saint-Germain were declared Ligue 1 champions on Thursday after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced professional sport could not resume before September.
Meanwhile, English Premier League clubs on Friday reconfirmed their commitment to finish the season subject to coronavirus restrictions being lifted.
There are still 92 games remaining. They will be behind closed doors with neutral venues suggested.
Also on Friday Italy’s 20 Serie A clubs reiterated their unanimous desire to complete the season despite sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora saying the chances of restarting were “increasingly narrow”.
In Spain, La Liga is planning to start testing players for the coronavirus between Tuesday and Thursday next week, after which they would then be able to resume individual training programmes within 48 hours.
Clubs in Germany resumed training in early April while adhering to strict social distancing guidelines. However, the risk is still apparent.
Cologne announced Friday three people had tested positive for the virus and were to be placed into a 14-day quarantine at home.
Cologne midfielder Birger Verstraete, whose partner suffers from a heart condition, said it was “strange” the club had not put the whole squad in quarantine following the tests, as suggested by Seehofer.
“It’s not up to me to decide what to do in the Bundesliga but I can say my head is not in football” at the moment, he told Flemish TV station VTM. “The health of my family, of my partner is the priority.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRUSSELS: Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne believes the Premier League season will be finished despite the coronavirus pandemic "because the financial aspect is far too important".
"My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks. The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give people something. I think this season will be finished," De Bruyne told Belgian daily Het Laatste Nieuws.
"The financial aspect is far too important in the Premier League. If the season is not finished, it will cause serious problems," he added.
Clubs were presented with the league's "Project Restart" plans at a meeting on Friday (May 1) and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-2020 season must be played at neutral venues.
De Bruyne also said he was optimistic about City's participation in next season's Champions League. UEFA has banned the club from European competition for the next two years for "serious breaches" of financial fair-play rules.
"The club told us they're going to appeal and that they're almost certain to get their way. I'm waiting to see what happens, but I trust my club," said De Bruyne.
The 28-year-old Belgium international admitted he would be forced to consider his City future if the ban was upheld.
"Once we know more, I will make a decision. Two years without playing in Europe would be long but in the case of one year I might see," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">De Bruyne believes Premier League will play to conclusion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne believes the Premier League season will be finished despite the coronavirus pandemic "because the financial aspect is far too important".
"My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks. The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give people something. I think this season will be finished," De Bruyne told Belgian daily Het Laatste Nieuws.
"The financial aspect is far too important in the Premier League. If the season is not finished, it will cause serious problems," he added.
Clubs were presented with the league's "Project Restart" plans at a meeting on Friday and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-2020 season must be played at neutral venues.
De Bruyne also said he was optimistic about City's participation in next season's Champions League. UEFA has banned the club from European competition for the next two years for "serious breaches" of financial fair-play rules.
"The club told us they're going to appeal and that they're almost certain to get their way. I'm waiting to see what happens, but I trust my club," said De Bruyne.
The 28-year-old Belgium international admitted he would be forced to consider his City future if the ban was upheld.
"Once we know more, I will make a decision. Two years without playing in Europe would be long but in the case of one year I might see," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">England's Jason Roy would accept cricket's return without fans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">London – England opener Jason Roy is desperate to get back to playing cricket, even if matches have to take place behind closed doors due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Roy, who was part of England's World Cup-winning team last year, had a taste of playing in an empty stadium in the Pakistan Super League earlier this year and said it was a bizarre experience.
"No atmosphere," said the 29-year-old. "Simple as that, to be honest. It was a very strange feeling.
"You're used to, as a batsman, with the bowler running in, it being relatively quiet. You learn to block out the crowd but then as soon as that ball's done you hear the crowd going absolutely berserk and over there when that was the case it was dead silence, it was the strangest thing."
The PSL, a Twenty20 competition, closed its doors to spectators in March before suspending the competition days later due to coronavirus.
Despite that experience, Roy, a destructive opening batsman, wants to get back to playing, with the start of the English season delayed until July 1 at the earliest.
"I'm more than happy to play behind closed doors," he said. "I think it would be nice just to get out there."
The Surrey player said the British government's lockdown meant he was severely limited in his ability to practice.
"I'm shadow-batting in the mirror, I'm looking pretty good," he joked. "So that's all I can do, to be honest, hitting a tennis ball against my wall here at home, going a bit stir crazy."
Roy said the ongoing disruption meant it could make sense to postpone the T20 World Cup, scheduled for Australia in October, but he said the players would make sure they were ready if it went ahead.
He said he was happy to start playing again when asked to by his bosses because he trusted their judgment, describing himself as a "pawn in the sporting world."
Roy was asked about comments made by Barcelona footballer Ivan Rakitic, who told the Spanish press he was ready to take the risk of returning to action despite the virus.
Roy said: "If an individual wants to go onto the front line and put himself at risk then good on him but if someone doesn't want to, then I don't think they should be ashamed of it either.
"Whatever's right in that situation. If the country desperately needs us to play cricket to make themselves feel better… but I'm not sure that's the case."
Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph reported that England could begin its rescheduled three-Test series against the West Indies on July 8.
The series was originally due to start on June 4 at the Oval. However, the spread of the coronavirus scuppered those plans.
England captain Joe Root and his West Indies counterpart Jason Holder have now been involved in talks over rescheduling.
"Positive ongoing discussions with the ECB and CWI continued on Friday," a spokesperson for the England and Wales Cricket Board said.
"Both boards were represented including captains, coaches, administrators and the chief medical officers from the respective boards.
"Discussions were wide-ranging including dialogue around revised schedules and COVID-19 medical and biosecurity planning.
"Meetings will be ongoing over the next few months to reach an outcome of when international cricket could potentially return."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cricket: England's 'stir-crazy' Roy happy to play behind closed doors</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: England's Jason Roy is ready to play in empty stadiums if the post-coronavirus situation demands so, said the opener who got a taste of it in his last outing.
Roy played a Pakistan Super League match on Mar 7 which took place behind closed doors in Lahore just before the pandemic halted international sports across the globe.
"There was no atmosphere, simple as that," the Durban-born batsman, a key figure in England's World Cup winning squad last year, told British media.
"It was very strange. As a batsman when the bowler’s running in you learn to block out the crowd, but as soon as the ball is done you can hear them going absolutely berserk.
"(In Lahore) there was just dead silence. You could hear your mate calling ones and twos, so you don’t just have to work off each other’s body language. It was hard to get up for it. But it was something we knew we had to deal with."
Playing without fans has been suggested as one possible way to resume cricket as soon as the pandemic subsides and Roy was ready to adjust.
"I'm more than happy to play behind closed doors. It would just be nice to get out there. I feel like a kid again," he said, adding he was "going a bit stir crazy" in the shutdown.
The global health crisis and the restrictions it has forced have clouded the outlook for this year's Twenty20 World Cup scheduled in Australia.
"If players aren’t able to prepare in the right way and are unable to get over to Australia, then it makes sense to postpone it," Roy said of the tournament scheduled in October-November.
"But if it goes ahead and we’re told we have three weeks to prepare all the boys will be putting in the hard yards to make sure we’re ready."

    <h5 class="mb-1">I get most goosebumps playing Indian Premier League, Andre Russell says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: Big-hitting West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell says playing for Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL is where he gets the “most goosebumps” and wants to remain in that side till his very last game in the league.
The 32-year-old was speaking to KKR’s official ‘Knights Unplugged’ online show. The Jamaican is currently at home as the IPL has been suspended indefinitely owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Let me confess something, IPL is where I get the most goosebumps. I get that in CPL (Caribbean Premier League) as well but when it comes to playing in IPL, especially Eden Gardens, there is no comparison,” Russell said referring to his team’s home ground in Kolkata.
“The welcome I get, that’s love. It puts pressure on me but it’s good pressure,” he added.
Russell said the Eden crowd has been supportive towards him even when he hasn’t exactly delivered and that’s why it’s the one place, he would like to call it quits as and when he does.
“I would love to be at KKR until that moment when I say that this will be my last IPL. I have been at KKR for six seasons and I enjoyed every bit of it,” he said.
“I know even if I fail two games straight, when I come out to bat for the third game, it is the same deafening reaction I will get from the crowd. It’s always a welcoming thing,” he said.
Hopeful of playing in the IPL some time this year, Russell also spoke about dealing with being away from his newborn daughter and wife. Both were in Miami when the coronavirus-forced travel restrictions came into force globally.
“She [his daughter] and Jassym, they are both in Miami. I stay connected to them and talk to them. I wish I could have them here, but with all these travel restrictions, we cannot do anything,” he said.
“It’s not really a situation anyone would want to be in. This is affecting the world, it’s affecting me, preventing me from hitting sixes. Hope this thing calms down in a month or two and we can go back to normal life again.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Is What Andre Russell Would Tell Shah Rukh Khan Before His Last IPL Season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) all-rounder Andre Russell revealed that he wants to play for the Kolkata-based franchise till he retires from the Indian Premier League (IPL). In an interview with the franchise, Andre Russell said he would let Shah Rukh Khan and the KKR staff know about his decision before going out to play his last game for the franchise. "I'd say, 'Listen, Shah Rukh, all the KKR staff, everyone. This will be my last IPL and the last home game playing in Kolkata," Russell said.
The West Indies all-rounder said he wants to witness the same atmosphere as players in big leagues such as English Premier League feel when they retire from the game and wave goodbye to the crowd.
"Just like players in big (football) leagues like English Premier League, or the Basketball guys (at NBA) retiring from the sport say 'okay, this is my last game' and they wave goodbye to the crowd - I imagine I would love to be at KKR until that moment in my career," Russell added.
Russell won the most valuable player award in last year's IPL but the 32-year-old said he wants to win the IPL trophy for KKR.
"I've been at KKR for 6 seasons now and I enjoy every bit - getting the MVP award and all is good, but I want more. I really need that cup as well, and I am really hoping that we can have the IPL this year, so we can become the Champions," Russell said.
In 2019, Russell smashed 510 runs in 14 games and picked up 11 wickets as well but his all-rounder heroics weren't enough to push KKR through to the play-offs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I thought of committing suicide three times, reveals Mohammed Shami</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: In a startling revelation, India speedster Mohammed Shami has claimed that he thought of committing suicide thrice while battling personal issues a few years ago, forcing his family to keep a watch over him at all times.
He said his family members feared he “might jump” from their 24th floor apartment.
Shami, one of India’s leading bowlers in recent years, opened up on his personal and professional life during an Instagram chat with teammate and limited overs squads’ vice-captain Rohit Sharma.
“I think if my family had not supported me back then I would have lost my cricket. I thought of committing suicide three times during that period due to severe stress and personal problems,” Shami revealed during the session on Saturday.
Now one of the mainstays of Indian bowling attack across formats, the 29-year-old was struggling to focus on his cricket, then.
“I was not thinking about cricket at all. We were living on the 24th floor. They [family] were scared I might jump from the balcony. My brother supported me a lot.
“My 2-3 friends used to stay with me for 24 hours. My parents asked me to focus on cricket to recover from that phase and not think about anything else. I started training then and sweated it out a lot at an academy in Dehradun,” Shami said.
In March 2018, Shami’s wife Hasin Jahan had accused him of domestic violence and lodged a complaint with the police, following which the India player and his brother were booked under relevant sections.
The upheaval in his personal life forced his employer BCCI to withheld the player’s central contracts for a while.
“Rehab was stressful as the same exercises are repeated every day. Then family problems started and I also suffered an accident. The accident happened 10-12 days ahead of the IPL and my personal problems were running high in the media,” Shami told Rohit.
Shami said his family stood like a rock with him and the support helped him get back on his feet.
“Then my family explained that every problem has a solution no matter how big the problem. My brother supported me a lot.”
Speaking about another painful period in his life after his injury in the 2015 World Cup, Shami said it took him almost 18 months to get back on the field.
“When I got injured in the 2015 World Cup, after that it took me 18 months to fully recover, that was the most painful moment in my life, it was a very stressful period.”

“Rehab was stressful as the same exercises are repeated every day. Then family problems started and I also suffered an accident. The accident happened 10-12 days ahead of the IPL and my personal problems were running high in the media,” Shami told Rohit.
Shami said his family stood like a rock with him and the support helped him get back on his feet.
“Then my family explained that every problem has a solution no matter how big the problem. My brother supported me a lot.”
Speaking about another painful period in his life after his injury in the 2015 World Cup, Shami said it took him almost 18 months to get back on the field.
“When I got injured in the 2015 World Cup, after that it took me 18 months to fully recover, that was the most painful moment in my life, it was a very stressful period.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thought of committing suicide three times, Mohammed Shami tells Rohit Sharma</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India pacer Mohammed Shami revealed in an Instagram Live session with Rohit Sharma on Saturday that he had considered killing himself three times during a period of “severe stress and personal problems”.
“I think if my family had not supported me back then I would have lost my cricket. I thought of committing suicide three times during that period due to severe stress and personal problems. I was not thinking about cricket at all. We were living on the 24th floor. They (family) were scared I might jump from the balcony,” Shami told Rohit.
“My 2-3 friends used to stay with me for 24 hours. My parents asked me to focus on cricket to recover from that phase and not think about anything else. I started training then and sweated it out a lot at an academy in Dehradun,” he said.
Shami also revealed that he almost took 18 months to get back on the field after his injury in the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup.
“Rehab was stressful as the same exercises are repeated every day. Then family problems started and I also suffered an accident. The accident happened 10-12 days ahead of the IPL and my personal problems were running high in the media,” Shami said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thought of committing suicide three times: Mohammed Shami opens up on darkest times</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India fast bowler Mohammed Shami has grown into a mainstay of Indian bowling attack across all three formats. But just a few years ago, things were going downhill for the Indian seamer. In an Instagram Live chat with fellow teammate Rohit Sharma, Shami opened up about the darkest moments of his life.
Speaking to Rohit, the 29-year-old recalled the injury he suffered in the 2015 Cricket World Cup, that saw him miss out on 18 months of cricket. “When I got injured in the 2015 World cup, after that it took me 18 months to fully recover, that was the most painful moment in my life, it was a very stressful period,” Shami was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.
He further added that he went through some personal issues in his life after he returned to cricket. “When I started playing again, I had to go through some personal issues, I think if my family did not support me I would not have made it, I also thought of committing suicide three times,” he said.

Shami’s suicide-thought revelation once again puts to light the importance of mental health in a sports person’s career. Not too long ago former India pacer Praveen Kumar had revealed his thoughts of ending his life when things had gone downhill for him.
Shami’s life was turned upside down when his wife accused him of adultery, domestic violence and match-fixing in March 2018. The pacer’s central contract was put on hold by BCCI till the investigations weren’t completed. He, however, was cleared by the board from fixing allegations and turned up for Delhi Daredevils in that year of IPL. On a personal front, it was just the beginning of a long legal battle with his wife.
“Someone used to stay with me 24*7, I was not well mentally, my family was there for me, if your family is there then you can get through any situation,” Shami added. “If my family was not there then I might have taken a bad step, but I thank my family for being with me throughout,” he further said.
Shami was last seen in action during the two-match Test series against New Zealand. The pacer would have been in action for the Kings XI Punjab if the IPL had started on March 29.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India speedster Mohammed Shami on Saturday revealed that he contemplated committing suicide at least thrice when he was enduring a difficult phase of his life in 2018.
Shami faced allegations of domestic violence and was booked after his wife Hasin Jahan lodged compliant against him.
"During that period there was also personal crisis in my life. You won’t believe it but I contemplated committing suicide three times during that period," Shami told his India teammate Rohit Shrama during an Instagram live session.
"My family members were worried that I might end up doing something drastic. I was just not able to thing about cricket at that point."
Shami said his family stood like a rock with him and that support helped him get back on his feet.
"Then my family explained that every problem has a solution no matter how big the problem. My brother supported me a lot. My 2-3 friends used to stay with me for 24 hours.
"My parents asked me to focus on cricket to recover from that phase and not think about anything else. I started training then and sweated it out a lot at an academy in Dehradun," Shami said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thought of Committing Suicide Thrice Due to Personal Issues: Shami Recounts Darkest Moments</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India’s pace ace Mohammed Shami made a shocking revelation on Saturday that he contemplated committing suicide three times while dealing with severe stress due to personal and professional issues. During an Instagram live chat with Indian limited-overs vice-captain Rohit Sharma, Shami revealed that he struggled to maintain focus after an injury in the 2015 ICC World Cup which kept him away from the action for nearly 18 months. However, Shami credited his family for their unparalleled support during the testing times which helped him recover strongly.

In early 2018, Shami’s wife Hasin Jahan had accused the fast bowler of domestic violence. Shami and his brother were booked for domestic violence under IPC Section 498A. Jahan also posted screenshots of Shami’s alleged chats with different women on social media. A local court in West Bengal issued an arrest warrant against Shami in September last year in the case.

“In 2015 I was injured at the World Cup. After that it took some 18 months to get back (into the Indian team) and this was the most painful phase of my career,” said Shami. “You know how difficult rehab gets and after that came the family problems. That was going on and in between all that I had an accident which was around 10-12 days before the IPL. A lot of hype was going in the media also with my personal issues,” he said.

The 29-year-old attributes the support he got from his family as the reason why he managed to bounce back from that phase to become an integral part of Team India in all formats.
“I feel if I didn’t have support from my family, then I would have left cricket. I had thought of suicide thrice at the time. Someone used to sit with me in my house to keep an eye on me. The house was on the 24th floor and they were afraid that I might jump out of my apartment,” Shami said.
“My brother supported me a lot. My 2-3 friends used to stay with me for 24 hours. My parents asked me to focus on cricket to recover from that phase and not think about anything else. I started training then and sweated it out a lot at an academy in Dehradun,” he added.
Since then, Shami has taken some big strides in international cricket and went on to become an integral part of the Indian fast bowling unit along with the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. He was the leading wicket-taker for India in the longest format in 2019. Shami scalped 33 wickets in just 8 Test matches last year.
At the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, Shami became the second Indian bowler to take a World Cup hat-trick.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mohammed Shami Reveals He "Thought Of Committing Suicide Thrice" In Darkest Moments</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Indian pace sensation Mohammed Shami on Saturday opened up about the darkest moments of his life when he had thought of committing suicide thrice. In an Instagram Live session with teammate Rohit Sharma, Shami said after his injury in the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup he almost took 18 months to get back on the field. The long 18 months were very stressful for Shami. The right-handed bowler said that after he started playing cricket again he went through some personal issues. Also in 2018, Shami's estranged wife Hasin Jahan had accused the cricketer of domestic violence. Shami said it was because of his family that he was able to face all the hardships.
"When I got injured in the 2015 World cup, after that it took me 18 months to fully recover, that was the most painful moment in my life, it was a very stressful period. When I started playing again, I had to go through some personal issues, I think if my family did not support me I would not have made it, I also thought of committing suicide three times," said Shami.
"Someone used to stay with me 24*7, I was not well mentally, my family was there for me, if your family is there then you can get through any situation. If my family was not there then I might have taken a bad step, but I thank my family for being with me throughout," he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thought of committing suicide thrice: India pacer Mohammed Shami on battling personal issues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India pacer Mohammed Shami said he thought of taking his life thrice while battling personal issues a few years ago.
During an Instagram chat with Rohit Sharma, Shami said that it was hard for him to get back on the field after his injury during the 2015 World Cup, taking him nearly 18 months to make a full recovery.
The pacer later went through a difficult period in 2018 after estranged wife Hasin Jahan had accused Shami and his family of alleged domestic abuse while also accusing the India pacer of age fudging and match-fixing.
Things started getting worse for Shami who was also involved in a minor accident just before the 2018 edition of the Indian Premier League where he suffered minor injuries.
“When I got injured in the 2015 World Cup, after that it took me 18 months to fully recover, that was the most painful moment in my life, it was a very stressful period,” Shami told Rohit.
“Rehab was stressful as the same exercises are repeated every day. Then, there were family problems too and I also suffered an accident. The accident happened 10-12 days ahead of the IPL and my personal problems was also played out in the media,” he added.
Shami has put all those problems behind, establishing himself as an indispensable bowler in India’s Test team while also being a part of their limited-overs set-up.
“I think if my family had not supported me back then I would have lost my cricket. I thought of committing suicide three times during that period due to severe stress and personal problems.
“I was not thinking about cricket at all. We were living on the 24th floor. They [family] were scared I might jump from the balcony. My brother supported me a lot. I had 2-3 friends used to stay with me through the day. My parents asked me to focus on cricket to recover from that phase and not think about anything else. I started training then and sweated it out a lot at an academy in Dehradun,” he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'I thought of committing suicide three times': Mohammed Shami reveals darkest moments of his life</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: In a startling revelation, India speedster Mohammed Shami has claimed that he thought of committing suicide thrice while battling personal issues a few years ago, forcing his family to keep a watch over him at all times.
He said his family members feared he "might jump" from their 24th floor apartment.
Shami, one of India's leading bowlers in recent years, opened up on his personal and professional life during an Instagram chat with teammate and limited overs squads' vice-captain Rohit Sharma.
"I think if my family had not supported me back then I would have lost my cricket. I thought of committing suicide three times during that period due to severe stress and personal problems," Shami revealed during the session on Saturday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul Pogba sent transfer warning amid uncertain future at Man Utd</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paul Pogba has been warned he will have fewer options because of the financial impact of the coronavirus if he tries to quit Manchester United.
Pogba attempted to leave United last summer and is wanted by Real Madrid and Juventus.
Juventus’ chief football officer Fabio Paratici claims fewer clubs can afford Pogba’s wage demands because the shutdown is costing them millions.
Pogba, 27, earns £290,000-a-week and Paratici says the landscape has changed.
“Pogba is a great player, we know him as a champion,” Paratici told Sky Italia.
“But something will change after the virus crisis because logically the salary demands someone of his level would have had before is now more difficult to get hold of, or at least he’ll have fewer clubs prepared to pay that money.”
Paratici’s comments may be a ploy to persuade Pogba to lower his contract demands to secure a return to Juventus and he quit the Serie A giants in 2016 to rejoin United in a then world record £89million deal.
Pogba claims he is still motivated to succeed, despite managing only eight appearances through injury before the shutdown.
“We have got to stay motivated, there’s no other choice,” he said. “We don’t know how long it will be like this, but I still have goals in my head and one day hopefully this will stop.
“And then we have to get back on the pitch, so we have to be ready. For myself, I have been out for a long time as well, so for me I just want to get back playing football.”
Meanwhile, Marcos Rojo appears to have broken the lockdown rules in his native Argentina after the defender, who is on loan at Estudiantes, was filmed smoking and playing cards with a group of friends.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Juventus chief admits Paul Pogba wage demands are a problem</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pogba continues to be linked with a move away from Old Trafford, with Inter Milan, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid believed to be interested in signing the 2018 World Cup winner this summer.
Paratici, though, has claimed that the 27-year-old will struggle to find a club prepared to meet his salary demands due to the impact the coronavirus outbreak has had thus far and will continue to have in the coming months.
"Pogba is a great player, but logically the salary demands someone of his level would've had before is now more difficult to get hold of, or at least he'll have fewer clubs prepared to pay that money." Paratici told Sky Sport Italia.
Inter have allegedly emerged as the front runners for the France international as they are prepared to pay cash for the midfielder rather than offering a swap deal.
Pogba, who could reportedly be available for £60m this summer, has not turned out for United in 2020 due to an ankle injury which ultimately required surgery.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Juventus make Paul Pogba Manchester United transfer admission</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici has warned Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba that any interested clubs may struggle to meet his salary demands due to the coronavirus crisis.
Speculation over Pogba 's future continues with Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus all linked with the Frenchman.
Pogba's contract is due to expire next summer, though United have the option to extend it for a further year. MEN Sport understand United are yet to trigger the clause and are relaxed about his future.
MEN Sport reported in February that the midfielder had told teammates he still wanted to leave the club after failing to secure a move last summer.
Paratici believes Juventus and other interested parties may not be able to afford Pogba's wages if he does seek an exit in the upcoming transfer window.
"Paul Pogba is a fantastic player, we know him as a champion," he told Sky Sport Italia .
"But something will change after the coronavirus crisis, because logically the salary demands someone at his level would have had before is now more difficult to get hold of.
"Or, at least, he’ll have fewer clubs prepared to pay that money."
Cristiano Ronaldo is currently the top earner at the Serie A side and Paratici explained that Pogba could not be offered a similar salary to the former Manchester United superstar.
The Italian feels clubs will need to find other solutions in the transfer market due to the financial climate.
He added: "Cristiano is a different player to all the others. He brings incredible and exponential growth in revenue, representing a brand that is almost as big as a club.
"Clubs will certainly have some more difficulties to deal with, so with less income, we’ll need to be more creative and elastic, finding a different formula for transfer deals.
"I expect many exchanges of players, although obviously we can’t use the NBA draft because that is a closed system.
"We should take more from the NBA and American sports in general. After all, the Premier League has this big advantage over the other leagues because they control the brand and represent the whole league rather than individual clubs."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">FC Barcelona have urged not to sell one of their stars as it could damage their chances of signing Neymar next season.

Arthur Melo has been linked with a move to Serie A Juventus in recent weeks in a move to help raise funds to sign Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain.
The Brazilian has already come out and silenced those reports while former Barcelona star Rivaldo believes it's important to keep the player, who has a good relationship with Neymar.
“There are lots of rumours about potential Barcelona transfers this summer and some press recently mentioned that Arthur could leave. I believe this is just talk and expect Arthur to stay at the club for many years," Rivaldo told Betfair.
“He hasn't completed two complete seasons there yet. He arrived as the potential successor to Xavi because of his similar style of play, so it makes no sense to sell him when he is just 23 and has his career ahead of him.
“Furthermore, Arthur has a good relationship with Neymar and selling the youngster could harm Barca's chances of bringing Neymar back.
“Of course, a potential Arthur move won't cancel a Neymar deal as he as many other friends at Barcelona. But I think it's important to keep a solid base to the squad and having Arthur could help persuade Neymar to return to the club.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">West Ham chiefs back Project Restart but express concern over neutral venues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">West Ham United will insist they want to finish the season - but are against the neutral venues plan.
The Hammers were one of six clubs to express doubts in Friday’s Premier League meeting about the Project Restart proposals to play out the remaining 92 fixtures.
It is understood they are in favour of finishing the season but believe using neutral venues compromises the integrity of the competition.
West Ham have five games at the London Stadium left this season against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Aston Villa, Watford, Burnley and Chelsea.
They will be crucial to their hopes of survival and, like others, the Irons are voicing concerns about them being switched to neutral venues.
It comes after Brighton chief executive Paul Barber issued a public statement saying neutral venues should be off the table.
Barber said: “Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.
"But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition."
West Ham currently find themselves 16th in the Premier League on 27 points, but they are only ahead of 17th-place Watford and 18th-place Bournemouth on goal difference.
19th-place Aston Villa could leapfrog the three teams ahead of them due to having a game in hand thanks to their participation in the Carabao Cup final against Manchester City.
In the heat of a closely-contested relegation battle, the Irons are loath to play five games at neutral venues which would otherwise be played at their 60,000-seater stadium - even though the matches would be played behind closed doors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">West Ham's London Stadium is perfect for Premier League's neutral venue plan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">West Ham’s London Stadium has been mooted as one of the ten potential neutral venues that could be used for “Project Restart” next month if the Premier League does make a return.
At this stage, the discussion of neutral venues is just that, a discussion, and there has been nothing decided on it or the potential use of London Stadium.
Football.London understands the Hammers have not been approached yet about the idea that was floated at the Premier League meeting on Friday as the clubs decide how to get the remaining 92 games of the season played.
The Hammers are not necessarily opposed to playing at neutral venues but would prefer to play their remaining home games in Stratford, unsurprisingly. However, if the Premier League plans come into force then no home teams would be able to play at their home ground so the Hammers couldn’t play their games at London Stadium.
So while West Ham’s players wouldn’t be able to turn out on their own pitch, London Stadium is one of the better venues being discussed and makes perfect sense to be a neutral ground.
It’s believed that even if games are played behind closed doors,there would still be around 500 people at the ground including security, staff, medical officers, players, referees and media.
Anyone who has been there will know the enormity of the London Stadium, it's an absolute behemoth of a place. Often to the detriment of atmosphere, you might say, but in a restarted Premier League it could be ideal.
Also, despite West Ham’s best efforts with the claret carpet surrounding the pitch and other touches here and there, the arena is still quite neutral itself when you are sitting in the seat and watching the game. Of course the councourses and other parts are more West Ham but once you’re across the walkways, it’s not as much.
The technical areas are enormous, extremely easy to maintain social distancing of two metres though the World Health Organisation recommends just one metre, again do-able in the areas. The benches behind them are massive too and there would be plenty of room behind them for players to sit if necessary. Stewards, other staff, everyone, can maintain a very safe distance from each other even down at pitchside.
The facilities, much like the stadium itself, are on a very large scale. Media who would potentially be heading to the arena have an enormous, ten-row press box in which to work in, which has more than 100 seats available but that would obviously be reduced with social distancing implemented.
In the underbelly of the stadium, the office space is vast. There is nothing cramped about working in London Stadium, though it’s unlikely office space will be reopened just yet. Some areas will be needed however.
The arena itself is set well, well away from the nearby Westfield shopping centre. It takes a good 10-20 minutes to walk across the number of bridges from Stratford station to get to the ground, or from Pudding Mill Lane DLR/Hackney Wick overground stations.
In a greedy way as well, this is a chance for the London Legacy Development Corporation and stadium owners E20 to generate some much needed revenue. The arena reports heavy losses year on year since the Olympics ended in 2012 and with the arena unlikely to hold athletics events this year, or musical concerts added to the Major League Baseball already having been cancelled there, it could be a chance to claw some cash back.
However, there is one drawback and it would be a big one - London. The capital is the UK's epicentre for Covid-19 patients so whether the Government would be happy for a London venue to be used, not just London Stadium but any of the five Premier League arenas in the capital, remains to be seen.
The London Stadium, sitting on it’s little island in east London and the capital’s “hippest new postcode” of E20 (their words, not ours), does fit the bill for what the Premier League might be looking for but the major drawback of the city itself could scupper the idea.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Playing games at neutral venues affect integrity of Premier League, proclaims Paul Barber</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This comes after clubs, across the English top flight, were told that there would be a change to the way things operate in any potential restart. That includes a neutral venue system which will see all the league games held at ten potential stadiums thus removing the home field advantage. However, while there has been no opposition to the plan as of yet, that has now officially changed.
Brighton and Hove Albion chief executive and deputy chairman Paul Barber has opined that it would destroy the integrity of the league. In the event of a restart the Seagulls will play five of their remaining nine games which could change the momentum of what is a relegation fight for them. But Barber further added that while the club are prepared to accept compromises and are willing to play behind closed doors, playing at a neutral venue is disadvantageous.
“Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be necessary … to fully support the government’s efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus,” Barber said on the club’s website.
“But at this critical point in the season, playing matches in neutral venues has [the] potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition,” he added. “The disadvantages of us not playing in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious.”

A normal draft year will see scouts and executives spend the spring crisscrossing Europe and North America collecting every scrap of information possible on hockey's next crop of high-end talent.
They watch games, talk to those closest to the prospects, conduct in-person interviews with players and examine physical testing results. The under-18 world championships, Canadian Hockey League playoffs and Memorial Cup are all on the list of must-attend events.

There's talk the NHL could hold its draft online in the first part of next month even though the 2019-20 season has yet to be completed. But that's far from the only unique aspect for teams poised to make franchise-altering decisions in this unprecedented era of social distancing.
In short, the book on many of the youngsters in question won't be fully written.
"It's nice to see how players perform in the playoffs," Benning said. "That's a big part, I think, of finding players that are winners ... when it gets hard in the playoffs, if they step up. We're going to miss out on all that.
"We're trying to do the best we can under the circumstances to get to know the players and try to figure out what they're going to be in three or four years time."
Scouts logged plenty of kilometres until the novel coronavirus outbreak brought hockey to a halt in mid-March, but there was still lots of work to do, especially outside the top half of an opening round headlined by Alexis Lafreniere and Quinton Byfield.
"Probably not as complete as it would be had it been a normal ending to the season," Columbus Blue Jackets GM Jarmo Kekalainen said of his team's eventual list for the draft, which was originally scheduled for June 26-27 in Montreal. "You're running around trying to (watch) the top guys one last time or guys that you had missed earlier in the year. Now we're watching tape instead.
"It will be different coverage, not as good coverage ... that's the reason why we have the amateur scouts on the road. It'll be a little bit different. It'll be interesting and we'll see how it goes."
Winnipeg Jets GM Kevin Cheveldayoff said clubs will be forced to lean heavily on the work put in from September through early March heading into what's expected to be a virtual draft similar to the one held by the NFL last month.
"We've always tried to keep a handle on times-seen of players ... try to have a good balance," he said. "Scouts, by their nature, live in the moment and go to the game and just hope the guy's not hurt. They've always had to adjust.
"The interesting thing is we're all in this same boat together. We all don't have to pick or choose which game you're going to, even though you'd love to be picking or choosing which game you're going to."
The NHL usually puts more than 100 draft prospects through physical testing at the combine next month. It's also an opportunity for teams to hold one-on-one meetings in hopes of getting to know the player on a more intimate different level.
Like businesses, families and friends separated during the pandemic, team front offices are getting creative with video conferencing platforms, but there will be blind spots in other areas.
"The biggest thing losing the combine is physical testing," Calgary Flames GM Brad Treliving said. "They all need to get stronger, but you get a sense of their frames and who needs what in terms of physical maturation."
While clubs will be at an obvious disadvantage, Toronto Maple Leafs goalie Jack Campbell said some players could be in the same boat, especially with the need for remote interviews.
"I just enjoy face-to-face no matter what scenario it is," said the 11th pick in the 2010 draft. "It's just more real, I guess. But you've got to just make the most of what we're given right now.
"It's definitely a unique process for the prospects and the organizations."
One that all involved, like the rest of society right now, will do their best to navigate.
"The work is still getting done," Treliving said. "Ultimately you're going to make decisions based on the information you have."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crystal Palace chief defends Premier League's coronavirus stance with reasons to resume season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has defended the Premier League's attempts to get the season back up and running amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Top-flight chiefs met on Friday to discuss their controversial 'Project Restart' proposal, with clubs committed to finishing the season when some social restrictions are relaxed.
It is understood the league is still working towards a best-case scenario of play being able to resume from the week beginning June 8.
Parish wrote in his column in The Sunday Times that he would respect if the nation decided that it was inappropriate for football to return, but he argued that it would help no-one if football or any industry "come out the other side in a worse state than we otherwise could have".
And, in an honest take on the crisis facing football, the Eagles chief has also explained why he is backing the proposal to get the campaign back underway - when it is safe to do so.
He said: "Isn’t it all just about the money? Well, not entirely. I want to complete the competition for reasons of sporting integrity.
"I want to crown Liverpool champions and give every other club a fair crack at the best league position they can achieve.
"I certainly don’t want to have difficult conversations about curtailing, voiding and points per game. The ramifications of each are complex and could involve legal challenges that run on for months, if not years.
"But, yes, it is partly about the money. And we should all care about the money. I’ll tell you why. Nobody wins if the Premier League receives less money. Nobody. We are already facing losses no one can quantify — and if we don’t finish the season we are entering uncharted waters."
Parish added that nobody would benefit if Premier League clubs faced major financial shortfalls by not completing the season.
"Football is one of the most efficient tax-generating industries in Britain: we pay the players a lot but 50 per cent goes straight back into the public purse," he said.
"Overall we pay about £3.3 billion in tax every year and it is the Premier League that largely funds the whole football pyramid."
He stated that the Premier League pays about £400million each year to the English Football League, £25 million to non-league and grassroots football, while suppliers, contractors and services depend on the clubs in their communities.
He added: "Some Premier League clubs are already warning they face crisis if they cannot get back to playing, and in the EFL many more may face extinction."
Parish also argued the return of Premier League football could boost the mental health of the nation and help define the "new normal" for other industries.
Parish said: "Football cannot occupy any paramedic or ambulance that the NHS needs. We must do our best not to create a public-order issue with supporters attempting to get close to grounds. Perhaps most importantly, we cannot take testing capacity from one person in greater need."
But he added: "I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the 'new normal' might look for a lot of working environments.
"Not only that, in our country and beyond, people need to find ways to move forward mentally, to experience some small relief from the worries of this crisis.
"In my view a story here and a conversation there about the game last night will not trivialise loss or suffering but offer a tiny respite from it for many people. Football is meaningless - but it is magnificently meaningless. It has the power to lighten lives; why not see if we can use that power again?"

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has argued the return of Premier League football could boost the mental health of the nation and help define the “new normal” for other industries.

But he added: “I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the ‘new normal’ might look for a lot of working environments.
“Not only that, in our country and beyond, people need to find ways to move forward mentally, to experience some small relief from the worries of this crisis. In my view a story here and a conversation there about the game last night will not trivialise loss or suffering but offer a tiny respite from it for many people. Football is meaningless — but it is magnificently meaningless. It has the power to lighten lives; why not see if we can use that power again?”
Parish claimed that player welfare and safety proposals would “render Premier League football one of the safest places in society to co-exist, much safer than a journey to the supermarket at present”.
And he added that nobody would benefit if Premier League clubs faced major financial shortfalls by not completing the season.
“Football is one of the most efficient tax-generating industries in Britain: we pay the players a lot but 50 per cent goes straight back into the public purse,” he said. “Overall we pay about £3.3 billion in tax every year and it is the Premier League that largely funds the whole football pyramid.”
He stated that the Premier League pays about £400million each year to the English Football League, £25 million to non-league and grassroots football, while suppliers, contractors and services depend on the clubs in their communities.
He added: “Some Premier League clubs are already warning they face crisis if they cannot get back to playing, and in the EFL many more may face extinction.”
According to media reports in the UK, clubs were told on Friday that limiting action to a handful of selected stadiums was the only way it would be possible to complete the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season for safety reasons.
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has some reservations about that prospect, fearing it could affect the “integrity” of the competition.
The Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing — which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Steve Parish: 'Premier League can help define new normal'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Parish defended attempts to get the season back up and running amid the coronavirus pandemic, stressing not doing so would be a major financial blow to taxpayers and the wider football community.
The Premier League met on Friday to discuss 'Project Restart' with clubs committed to finishing the season when some social restrictions are relaxed. It is understood the league is still working towards a best-case scenario of play being able to resume from the week beginning June 8.
Parish wrote in his column in The Sunday Times that he would respect if the nation decided that it was inappropriate for football to return, but he argued that it would help no-one if football or any industry "come out the other side in a worse state than we otherwise could have".
Parish said: "Football cannot occupy any paramedic or ambulance that the NHS needs. We must do our best not to create a public-order issue with supporters attempting to get close to grounds. Perhaps most importantly, we cannot take testing capacity from one person in greater need."
But he added: "I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the 'new normal' might look for a lot of working environments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Premier League will return for financial reasons, says De Bruyne</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin De Bruyne believes financial imperatives will force the Premier League to complete the 2019-20 season.
Reports in the UK this week suggested a June 8 restart behind closed doors is on the agenda.
Representatives from England's top clubs met on Friday to discuss the proposals put forward in the so-called 'Project Restart', including safety and testing procedures designed to minimise risks to players and staff amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Manchester City star De Bruyne expects to be back in training by the middle of this month, even if playing matches at neutral venues without fans does not full him with enthusiasm.
"My feeling says that we may be able to train again within two weeks," he told HLN. "The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give people something.
"Everything will be finished without fans, I think. That is not really interesting for anyone, but this season will be finished.
"The financial aspect is far too important in the Premier League. If the season is not finished, it will cause serious problems."
Ligue 1 and the Eredivisie have cancelled their seasons, although the Premier League currently stands alongside the Bundesliga, LaLiga and Serie A in intending to reach a conclusion.
City striker Sergio Aguero told El Chiringuito this week that many players were "scared" to return to action because of the increased risk posed to their families, something De Bruyne – whose wife is expecting their third child – understands.
"Everyone will be tested once we start playing again," he said.
"I don't think [players] are really afraid for themselves, but for their family. That is mainly the problem for many people."
The Belgium international was enjoying an exceptional campaign individually.
He has eight goals and 16 assists in the Premier League this term, while his man-of-the-match performance inspired City's 2-1 win at Real Madrid in the first leg of a last-16 Champions League tie that is yet to be completed.
"You are in a rhythm and you have to stop suddenly," he added.
"When the league resumes, I don't really see this as an extension of the season. This feels more like the start of a new season.
"I have never stood still for so long in my career. Well, I'm not going to make a problem of it. Greater powers are at work. Whatever is said and decided, I agree."

    <h5 class="mb-1">A crucial week ahead for Premier League</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Premier League has entered a pivotal week in its bid for a summer restart after clubs reiterated their desire to complete the season.
Further talks are planned in the coming days as top-flight clubs try to agree on a plan which they hope would then receive government approval.
Representatives from Wolves and Villa were yesterday part of a four-hour teleconference call in which clubs discussed various aspects of Project Restart, including playing the remaining 92 matches at neutral venues and the health checks which would be required.
Another meeting has been scheduled for next week, when the government is also due to announce whether the current lockdown restrictions will remain in place.
In a statement, the Premier League said it was considering the ‘first tentative moves forward’ but ‘will only return to training and playing with government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers’.
Talks are planned with both the LMA and PFA in the coming days, with the suggestion players might only be permitted to train in masks and would need to be tested twice a week for coronavirus should the season resume.
For now, the day-to-day situation at the Midlands’ Premier League clubs remains unchanged.
Villa’s Bodymoor Heath training ground remains closed with a number of players thought to be wary of returning, even for individual sessions, while the country remains in lockdown.
Wolves, who have kept Compton Park partially open for solo training, are continuing to monitor the situation, with boss Nuno Espirito Santo primed for a return to the UK should the season restart be given the go-ahead.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rafael recalls how Rio Ferdinand would make Cristiano Ronaldo defend for Man Utd</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Manchester United right-back Rafael da Silva says Rio Ferdinand was the best defender he played with at Old Trafford, and has recalled how the Englishman would stand up to Cristiano Ronaldo on the pitch.
Rafael arrived at United with his twin brother Fabio in 2008, ensuring that he spent one year with Ronaldo in the first-team at Old Trafford as he made 28 appearances for the club in the 2008/09 season.
That was Ronaldo's last at United before he left for Real Madrid, and Rafael says Ferdinand's influence on the defensive side of his game was crucial.
"Rio Ferdinand is the best defender I played with, by far. I tell you, by far. By far he’s the best defender I played with," the 29-year-old, now of Lyon, told ESPN.
"He was a good leader. For me a centre-back has got to be a leader.
"So many times I saw, when I arrived at Manchester United, I saw Rio – Ronaldo was one of the best already – I saw Rio just saying, 'Come back! Come back!'
"You know like he shouted with him. But he spoke with everybody.
"So a leader is that, because you have to speak with your best player because he has to defend as well, because if he is not defending it is hard for us.
"And then on the pitch he was one of the best, with the ball, positionally. So Rio Ferdinand is for me the best centre-back I played with."
Rafael spent six years alongside Ferdinand at United, winning three Premier League titles, before the Englishman would leave for Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2014.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sancho's unforgettable 2017, replacing Dembele & snubbing Madrid</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jadon Sancho had an unforgettable 2017: in May, he was runner up in the U17 Euros, where he was named the best player at the tournament. In August, he left Manchester City (despite Pep Guardiola wanting him to stay) and signed for Borussia Dortmund. He was 17 and unknown to many, but when he was presented at the German club he made it clear he wasn't there to make up the numbers. 
Sancho took on the No.7 shirt that had been vacated by Ousmane Dembele, who had signed for Barcelona. The significance was clear: he has arrived in Dortmund ready to equal -- or better -- Dembele. He'd arrived after turning down an offer from Real Madrid, too, to join their second team with first-team chances to come. But Sancho wanted a quicker path to the top and went to Dortmund, where young talent is allowed to thrive (Dembélé, Isak, Sancho, Haaland, etc). 
That same year, 2017, in October, he was part of the England squad for the U17 World Cup. He took part in the group stages, excelling with three goals in three games, but halfway through the tournament, Dortmund called him back. He still hadn't played for the first team at that point. "I hope it's to play in the first team," England coach Steve Cooper said. "If not, I can't think of any reason to take a player away from a World Cup. 
Sancho returned to Europe, made his Dortmund debut, playing in the Bundesliga, and the England national team still managed to win the World Cup, beating Spain 5-2 in the final. Sancho would probably have gone on to be named the player of the tournament, but that honour went to his former City teammate, Phil Foden.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NHL could face another hurdle if the league decides to continue the 2019-20 season in the near future — getting non-Canadian resident players across the border to join their respective teams.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Sunday that players would — at a minimum — need to follow quarantine protocols if they were to arrive in Canada while the border remains closed due to the pandemic.
"I think it's a question we'll have to look into," Trudeau said in a press briefing. "Certainly at a strict minimum, anyone who arrives from another country will have to follow all the rules of quarantine in an extremely strict manner, but we're not there yet in our discussions with the NHL."
"We recognize that it's a possibility, but it depends on an enormous amount of things, and I don't want to speculate on this until there's more discussion."
The Associated Press reported earlier this week that Edmonton and Toronto were being looked at as possible "hockey pod" cities that could host the remainder of the NHL season during the summer months. Games would be played in air-conditioned arenas without fans.
A person familiar with discussions told The Associated Press that the most aggressive timetable would have players returning to their home rinks as early as May 15, followed by a training camp and possible exhibition games in June.
Under that timeline, the regular season would resume in July with the Stanley Cup final likely stretching into September.
The league and NHL Players' Association have formed a joint committee to determine a path forward that could get games back on the ice sometime in July without fans in attendance.
The committee said Wednesday in a statement that they "have not made any decisions or set a timeline for possible return to play scenarios," but remained hopeful that players could return to their teams for "small group activities" by mid-to-late May.
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said recently that no decisions have been made and noted that government and medical officials will ultimately make the call on when sports can return.
The season was paused on March 12, one day after the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 spread a pandemic — and one day after the NBA suspended its season following a positive novel coronavirus test on a Utah Jazz player.
As of early April, eight NHL players had tested positive for COVID-19, including five players on the Ottawa Senators.
Each team had between 10 and 14 games remaining on its regular-season schedule at the time of the suspension.
Four Canadian teams — Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary and Winnipeg — were all in playoff position as of March 12, with Vancouver on the bubble.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dimitar Berbatov sends transfer message to Harry Kane amid Manchester United links</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Manchester United forward Dimitar Berbatov has likened the position Harry Kane is in at the minute to one he was in back in 2008.
Berbatov won two Premier League titles at Old Trafford after leaving Spurs to join United in the summer of 2008, and believes Kane may have to do the same to secure silverware.
Although the England skipper has scored 181 goals in 278 appearances for Tottenham, he is yet to win any silverware with the North London club.
Kane recently hinted he could leave Spurs if they fail to match his ambition and Berbatov believes Kane may soon have a difficult decision to make.
Berbatov was once in a similar position and believes Kane’s head is "not in the right place" and says he may need to make the "tough decision" soon.
“The final step for me was joining Manchester United and I knew I would be making people disappointed – especially Tottenham fans – but I was following my own path,” he told the Football Dailypodcast.
“I knew if I missed that chance another one might not come. This is how it is in football. Sometimes you need to make tough decisions.
“The same situation is happening with Harry Kane at the moment, the exact same. He’s in the same situation as I was in as he has started asking questions and maybe his head is not in the right place. My head was not in the right place.
“It was the same with [Christian] Eriksen. He wasn’t really there in the last couple of games. I watched the games and I saw that his head was not there.”
Before the former United man added: “Kane is in the same situation. If there is any truth in the rumours, it’s in his head, 100 percent.
“The lack of trophies is the main problem for players like Kane. He’s not getting any younger. He wants to look back and know he won trophies.
“When I see Spurs play United now, even if on paper Spurs have better players, they still go there with fear.”

"The most painful part is that Spurs' last trophy was when me and Jermaine [Jenas] were there. It will be stated over and over again and make people angry that the lack of trophies is the main problem for players like Kane, who is captain of England and not getting younger.
"But when he gets older he wants to say to his kids: 'Look what I won'."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dimitar Berbatov sends fresh message to Harry Kane over Man United transfer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dimitar Berbatov believes Harry Kane’s head is ‘not in the right place’ and says he may need to make the ‘tough decision’ to leave Tottenham for Manchester United.
Former striker Berbatov won two Premier League titles at Old Trafford after leaving Spurs to join United in 2008 and says Kane may have to follow suit.
Kane has been one of the most prolific goalscorers in Europe over the past six seasons, scoring 181 goals in 278 appearances for Tottenham.
But the England captain is yet to win any silverware in north London and admitted in March he may be forced to leave if Spurs fail to improve because he wants to win trophies ‘sooner rather than later’.
Berbatov says Kane is in the ‘exact same situation’ as he was over a decade ago and may need to leave Tottenham.
‘The final step for me was joining Manchester United and I knew I would be making people disappointed – especially Tottenham fans – but I was following my own path,’ Berbatov told the Football Daily podcast.
‘I knew if I missed that chance another one might not come. This is how it is in football. Sometimes you need to make tough decisions.
‘The same situation is happening with Harry Kane at the moment, the exact same.
‘He’s in the same situation as I was in as he has started asking questions and maybe his head is not in the right place. My head was not in the right place.
‘It was the same with [Christian] Eriksen. He wasn’t really there in the last couple of games. I watched the games and I saw that his head was not there.’
Bulgaria legend Berbatov added: ‘Kane is in the same situation. If there is any truth in the rumours, it’s in his head, 100 per cent.
‘The lack of trophies is the main problem for players like Kane. He’s not getting any younger. He wants to look back and know he won trophies.
‘When I see Spurs play United now, even if on paper Spurs have better players, they still go there with fear.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pogba could have fewer suitors post-coronavirus - Juve chief</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paul Pogba could have fewer suitors in the coming transfer window as clubs struggle to fund deals, according to Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici.
Former Juve star Pogba has long been linked with a move away from current club Manchester United, with the Bianconeri, Inter and Real Madrid mooted as potential destinations.
However, football has been suspended and in some cases abandoned for the season in Europe's top leagues amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Elite clubs have been forced to seek agreements with players for wage cuts or deferrals in order to save money, with income from television deals in the balance and ticket sales unlikely to return soon.
Paratici suggests Pogba is one example of a star name who could find his pathway blocked in the market.
"[Pogba] is a great footballer, but this type of player could struggle to have the same interest as before," the Juve chief told Sky Sport Italia.
Stressing a need to be "creative" with moves, Paratici explained: "In the near future, the transfer market will have less money.
"We are going through a complicated time globally. We will have to rely on exchanges, on long loans. If you cannot buy a house, you rent. The same thing will happen in football.
"It is a formula that will be used to dilute the payments and take advantage of the players required.
"If we talk about the top 10 or 20 teams in the world exchanging players, the market values ​​will not go down.
"On the other hand, wages will drop, while if you sell a single player, his value could drop."
World Cup winner Pogba is in his fourth season back at United, having returned to Old Trafford - where he came through the academy - after a successful four-year stint at Juve.
While with the Serie A giants, Pogba won a quartet of Scudetti, two Coppa Italias, two Supercoppa Italianas and reached the 2014-15 Champions League final.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Juvenuts are ready to offload Douglas Costa, Miralem Pjanic and Federico Bernardeschi in order to sign Manchester United star Paul Pogba, reports claim.
While Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants to keep the France international at Old Trafford next season – hoping he’ll form a partnership with United new boy Bruno Fernandes – his future remains uncertain.
A host of top sides around Europe are wanting to land him, with Juventus facing competition from the likes of Serie A rivals Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Paris Saint Germain to bring him back to Turin.
Any deal is far from straightforward for the Italian champions, according to Gazzetta dello Sport.

They will need to raise funds to pull off such a high-profile transfer and are willing to sacrifice some big names from the first-team squad to lure the World Cup winner back to Juventus.
Costa, Bernadeschi and Pjanic are among the names Juve chiefs are willing to sacrifice in order to get the transfer over the line.
PSG are willing to take a similar stance, with former Manchester United man Angel Di Maria among those who could be moved on.
Pogba has endured an injury-hit season, starting just five Premier League games due to an ankle problem.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Neymar might consider a transfer offer away from Barcelona</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Despite displaying incredible form by scoring18 goals and providing 10 assists in 22 matches across all competitions Neymar wants to leave Paris Saint-Germain and return back to Barcelona. Lionel Messi has succeeded in pressurising Bartomeu to make Neymar the club’s primary transfer target in the upcoming transfer window.
The Spanish giants are in a great deal of financial strain caused by the outbreak of coronavirus and are finding it extremely tough to fulfil Messi’s demand to bring Neymar back to the Camp Nou. The Parisians will try to recover the most out of the 222 million euros they spent to sign the Brazilian, but have reportedly agreed to reduce his asking price to 164 million euros now.
To make matters worse for Barcelona, Don Balon has stated that Manchester United has joined the race to sign Neymar in the upcoming transfer window. The Red Devils are in a stage of re-establishing the attack in their squad and plan on offering 165 million euros to get the Brazil international to the Old Trafford to play alongside the creative minds of Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes. He is yet to respond to the interest shown by Manchester United and might be waiting to see if the Red Devils manage to qualify for the Champions League next season.
Barca mustn’t let the Brazilian superstar join the English giants as they will lose out on the opportunity to bring in a potential successor to Messi. Signing Neymar will also help improve the captain’s morale in the club which hasn’t been great ever since his conflict with the club’s director Eric Abidal.
Another benefit of signing the Brazilian international is that it will release the pressure of Ansu Fati and Antoine Griezmann who have been overused and overstretched this season due to the injury of Luis Suarez.
The Blaugrana must fast-track the sales of their players such as Philippe Coutinho, Arturo Vidal, Ivan Rakitic and Samuel Umtiti to gather sufficient funds to submit a lucrative transfer offer for Neymar. Barcelona could potentially even try to include these players as add-ons in the future transfer offers in order to tempt PSG to reduce their asking price.
Do you think Barca will be able to sign Neymar Junior in the upcoming transfer window?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Agent tips Newcastle United-linked 6ft 2in colossus to move this summer, huge clubs reportedly after him</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With Newcastle United on the verge of a takeover, the Magpies are being been linked with plenty of players and coaches amid the prospect of St James’ Park having a huge budget going forward.
According to El Desmarque, Newcastle are one of several clubs to have made an offer for Real Valladolid defender Mohammed Salisu.
The 21-year-old has come through the ranks at the La Liga club and has enjoyed a superb breakthrough season, making 27 league appearances.
As well as Newcastle, Salisu has been linked with a host of other big European clubs including Manchester United, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.
The Ghana international’s release clause is reportedly set at £10.4 million, a very modest price for such a talented young centre-back.
Furthermore, Juan Mata Sr – Salisu’s agent and the Manchester United midfielder’s father – thinks the upcoming transfer window will see his client make a move.
“Salisu is another very young African discovery. This year he has been a sensation in La Liga because at only 20 years old, 1.90m (6ft 2in), left-footed, and playing centre back in this division is not easy,” Mata told Vip Deportivo.
“The truth is that I think this may be his window [to leave], because interest has arisen from many clubs, and he deserves it.”
For a player of Salisu’s age, build and quality to have such a low reported release clause would constitute an absolute bargain, and Newcastle really should pursue this option.
However, it won’t be easy for the Magpies – when you have the likes of Manchester United, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid also said to be interested, they could make very convincing cases for a player to join them.
Could a Newcastle with huge financial muscle and an exciting project on the cards see off two of the most famous clubs in the world (United and Real) and two regular silverware challengers, domestically and in Europe (Atletico and Real)?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — Former Michigan quarterback Shea Patterson has agreed to terms with the Kansas City Chiefs as an undrafted free agent.
Agent Bryan Ehrlich confirmed the deal Sunday. Patterson started all 26 games for the Wolverines over the past two seasons after transferring from Mississippi.
Patterson threw for 3,061 yards with 23 touchdowns and eight interceptions last season. He threw 45 touchdown passes in his two years at Michigan. Patterson passed for 131 yards in the Senior Bowl.
Patterson started 10 games at Ole Miss but transferred after the school was hit by NCAA sanctions. He was granted eligibility at Michigan in 2018 without sitting out a year.

Agent Bryan Ehrlich confirmed the deal Sunday. Patterson started all 26 games for the Wolverines over the past two seasons after transferring from Mississippi.
Patterson threw for 3,061 yards with 23 touchdowns and eight interceptions this season. He threw 45 touchdown passes in his two years at Michigan. Patterson passed for 131 yards in this year’s Senior Bowl.
Patterson started 10 games at Ole Miss but transferred after the school was hit by NCAA sanctions. He was granted eligibility at Michigan in 2018 without sitting out a year.
He’s likely to battle former Mississippi teammate Jordan Ta’Amu, who signed with the Chiefs earlier this offseason after a successful stint with the XFL’s St. Louis BattleHawks, for a potential third quarterback spot behind Patrick Mahomes and Chad Henne.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kansas City Chiefs sign undrafted Michigan QB Patterson</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Kansas City Chiefs have agreed to terms with undrafted Michigan quarterback Shea Patterson.
The deal was announced by Patterson's agent, Bryan Ehrlich.
Patterson began his collegiate career at Mississippi before transferring to Michigan following his sophomore season in 2017 when Ole Miss were hit by NCAA sanctions.
He was able to play at Michigan immediately without needing to sit out a year, and started all 26 games for the Wolverines over the past two seasons, throwing for 5,661 yards with 45 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.
Patterson fell off most teams' draft boards, however, due to some inconsistent play in 2019 and a pedestrian performance in this year’s Senior Bowl, passing for 130 yards with a touchdown and an interception.
With Patrick Mahomes and backup Chad Henne set at QB for the reigning Super Bowl champions, Patterson will likely be competing with former XFL quarterback Jordan Ta'amu for the number three job.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bears sign safety Tashaun Gipson</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to Larry Mayer of chicagobears.com, the Chicago Bears signed safety Tashaun Gipson Sr. of Waynesville, MO, to a one-year contract on Friday. Financial terms have not yet been disclosed.
The Bears become Gipson’s fourth National Football League franchise. He has previously played for the Cleveland Browns (2012 to 2015), Jacksonville Jaguars (2016 to 2018) and Houston Texans (2019).
Last season with the Texans, Gipson Sr. played in 14 games and had three interceptions for 105 yards. He also had 51 combined tackles (37 solo tackles and 14 assisted tackles), two tackles for a loss, and three quarterback hits. Gipson Sr.’s three tackles for a loss were a career high.
Of Gipson Sr.’s three interceptions, one was for a touchdown. It came in a 53-32 Texans win over the Atlanta Falcons on October 6. Gipson Sr. picked off a Matt Ryan pass attempt with 39 seconds left in the football game and ran for 79 yards, which gave the Texans a 21 point lead. Gipson Sr.’s other interceptions in 2019 came in a 31-24 Texans win over the Kansas City Chiefs (zero yards) on October 13 and in a 38-24 Texans loss to the Denver Broncos for 26 yards on December 8.
Gipson’s finest NFL season came in 2014. That season he represented the Browns in the Pro Bowl and led the NFL in interception yards (158). Gipson Sr. also had a career-high six interceptions, one interception for a touchdown, one forced fumble, 52 combined tackles (28 solo tackles and 24 assisted tackles), and two tackles for a loss.
In Gipson’s eight-year NFL career, he has played in 112 games and started 104 of them. He has 23 interceptions for 550 yards, three touchdowns from an interception, one forced fumble, one fumble, one fumble recovery, 450 combined tackles (327 solo tackles, and 123 assisted tackles), 13 tackles for a loss and four quarterback hits.
It is expected that Gipson Jr. will be the Bears starting strong safety in 2020. He is projected to play alongside free safety Eddie Jackson of Lauderdale Lakes, FL.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tottenham defender Japhet Tanganga sets his sights on England call-up when football resumes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tottenham defender Japhet Tanganga is hoping for an England call-up when football finally resumes to achieve his "goal" of becoming a senior international.
The 21-year-old burst on to the scene in January after being surprisingly handed his Premier League debut against Liverpool and he went on to make a further nine appearances before the season was curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic.
The Englishman, who has played all across the back four in his fleeting career, will already be known to England boss Gareth Southgate, having represented England at every age group up to the U20s.
The 12-month postponement of Euro 2020 could well work out well for Tanganga, who is vocal about his desire for a full cap.
He said: "In life you have to have goals and one of my goals is to be capped at senior level for England.
"For me, all I can do is what I can on the pitch and leave it with the England manager to select me.
"All I'm doing at the moment is following the guidelines and waiting for the government to decide when we can go back to football or not. Right now, that's all I'm focusing on.
"Like I said, in life you have to have ambitions and one of my goals is to get capped at senior level for England.
"Fikayo [Tomori] has done that and now I'm in a similar position. I see it as an opportunity and an example to follow and hopefully one day I can get capped and achieve one of my goals."
If Tanganga does get the call, he will owe a lot to Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho, who was brave enough to throw him in for a Premier League debut against the league leaders.
The Portuguese was working hard with him in training as well, before they were restricted to fitness sessions via video call when the pandemic struck in March.
"He has taught me a lot," Tanganga admitted. "In training he's given me a lot of information, a lot of details, a lot of ways to improve.
"How to defend one v one, how to defend set-pieces or work in wide areas and at corners. He's given me a lot of information and I feel playing right-back and left-back has added to my game and allowed me to be adaptable and defend in all areas of the pitch, not just at centre-half.
"So yeah, he's helped me a lot, given a lot of information, he's really been very helpful."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tottenham defender Japhet Tanganga hoping to make his case for England call-up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tottenham defender Japhet Tanganga hopes his impressive rise can continue when football finally resumes and has set his sights on an England call-up.
The 21-year-old burst on to the scene in January after being surprisingly handed his Premier League debut against Liverpool and he went on to make a further nine appearances before the season was curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Those sort of minutes for a young English player is usually enough to get Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate’s attention, with Chelsea’s Fikayo Tomori a good comparison having got his chance after less than half a season in Frank Lampard’s first team.
The defender, who has played all across the back four in his fleeting career, will already be known to Southgate, having represented England at every age group up to the Under-20s.
The 12-month postponement of Euro 2020 could well work out well for Tangana, who is vocal about his desire for a full cap .
“In life you have to have goals and one of my goals is to be capped at senior level for England,” he said. “For me, all I can do is what I can on the pitch and leave it with the England manager to select me.
“All I’m doing at the moment is following the guidelines and waiting for the government to decide when we can go back to football or not. Right now, that’s all I’m focusing on.
“Like I said, in life you have to have ambitions and one of my goals is to get capped at senior level for England.
“Fikayo has done that and now I’m in a similar position. I see it as an opportunity and an example to follow and hopefully one day I can get capped and achieve one of my goals.”
If he does get the call, he will owe a lot to Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho.
Mourinho, who has a reputation for ignoring young players, publicly singled Tanganga out for praise in his first training session at the club and then was brave enough to throw him in for a Premier League debut against the champions-elect.
The Portuguese was working hard with him in training as well, before they were restricted to fitness sessions via video call when the pandemic struck in March.
“He has taught me a lot,” Tanganga admitted. “In training he’s given me a lot of information, a lot of details, a lot of ways to improve.
“How to defend one v one, how to defend set-pieces or work in wide areas and at corners. He’s given me a lot of information and I feel playing right-back and left-back has added to my game and allowed me to be adaptable and defend in all areas of the pitch, not just at centre-half.
“So yeah he’s helped me a lot, given a lot of information, he’s really been very helpful.”
Tanganga has been one of the Spurs players who have stuck to government rules during the lockdown and has stayed at home with his family playing card games.
“I’m back at home with my family – my mum, dad, older brother and two younger sisters – and to be fair it’s been good,” he said.
“It’s not an ideal situation being indoors and we’ve got to follow the guidelines. But for me it’s been alright.
“It’s allowed me to spend time with my family, get close with them, play some games together, talk about things we’ve missed out on because of work or school.
“It’s allowed us to settle down, brought us closer together. We like to play Blackjack – not gambling, just trying to get rid of the deck. And Uno.
“With my friends, I play Monopoly online on PS4 – I’ve become really addicted. Also FIFA, 2K NBA, things like that. With the boys at Spurs, we play FIFA, 2K NBA – I’m a big fan of basketball so we play that a lot.”
The time away has also allowed Tanganga to reflect on his whirlwind few months, going from academy prospect to first-team regular.
“It was crazy. It just goes to show that anything can happen,” he said.
“This time last year could I see myself in this position? I don’t think so. It just goes to show how quickly things can change in football.
“Yeah, there have been moments where I wake up in the morning and remember the morning of the Liverpool game – it was disappointing to lose – but that feeling of making my debut.
“And remembering the congratulations messages from everyone. So this time has allowed me to sit back and reminisce on that breakthrough season. I just want to continue it.”

The defender, who has played all across the back four in his fleeting career, will already be known to Southgate, having represented England at every age group up to the Under-20s.
The 12-month postponement of Euro 2020 could well work out well for Tangana, who is vocal about his desire for a full cap .
"In life you have to have goals and one of my goals is to be capped at senior level for England," he said. "For me, all I can do is what I can on the pitch and leave it with the England manager to select me.
"All I'm doing at the moment is following the guidelines and waiting for the government to decide when we can go back to football or not. Right now, that's all I'm focusing on.
"Like I said, in life you have to have ambitions and one of my goals is to get capped at senior level for England.
"Fikayo has done that and now I'm in a similar position. I see it as an opportunity and an example to follow and hopefully one day I can get capped and achieve one of my goals."
If he does get the call, he will owe a lot to Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho.
Mourinho, who has a reputation for ignoring young players, publicly singled Tanganga out for praise in his first training session at the club and then was brave enough to throw him in for a Premier League debut against the champions-elect.
The Portuguese was working hard with him in training as well, before they were restricted to fitness sessions via video call when the pandemic struck in March.
"He has taught me a lot," Tanganga admitted. "In training he's given me a lot of information, a lot of details, a lot of ways to improve.
"How to defend one v one, how to defend set-pieces or work in wide areas and at corners. He's given me a lot of information and I feel playing right-back and left-back has added to my game and allowed me to be adaptable and defend in all areas of the pitch, not just at centre-half.
"So yeah he's helped me a lot, given a lot of information, he's really been very helpful."
Tanganga has been one of the Spurs players who have stuck to government rules during the lockdown and has stayed at home with his family playing card games.
"I'm back at home with my family – my mum, dad, older brother and two younger sisters – and to be fair it's been good," he said.
"It's not an ideal situation being indoors and we've got to follow the guidelines. But for me it's been alright.
"It's allowed me to spend time with my family, get close with them, play some games together, talk about things we've missed out on because of work or school.
"It's allowed us to settle down, brought us closer together. We like to play Blackjack – not gambling, just trying to get rid of the deck. And Uno.
"With my friends, I play Monopoly online on PS4 – I've become really addicted. Also FIFA, 2K NBA, things like that. With the boys at Spurs, we play FIFA, 2K NBA – I'm a big fan of basketball so we play that a lot."
The time away has also allowed Tanganga to reflect on his whirlwind few months, going from academy prospect to first-team regular.
"It was crazy. It just goes to show that anything can happen," he said.
"This time last year could I see myself in this position? I don't think so. It just goes to show how quickly things can change in football.
"Yeah, there have been moments where I wake up in the morning and remember the morning of the Liverpool game – it was disappointing to lose – but that feeling of making my debut.
"And remembering the congratulations messages from everyone. So this time has allowed me to sit back and reminisce on that breakthrough season. I just want to continue it."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The former Sunderland youngster who will be playing in Europe with Dutch side next season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Sunderland goalkeeper Michael Woud has revealed he felt as if there was no clear pathway for young players to succeed at the Stadium of Light.
The New Zealand international joined Sunderland as a teenager back in 2015 and spent three seasons playing for the club's under-18 and under-23 sides - via brief loan spell at Sunderland RCA - before joining Dutch side Willem II in 2018.
Woud was highly rated when he first joined the club and impressed in both the 2015 under-17 World Cup and 2017 under-20 World Cup for New Zealand.
And he admits he was blown away by Sunderland's facilities after joining the club from New Zealand side Bay Olympic.
"It was a massive change for me in my life," Woud told Chronicle Live.
"I was just 16 when I came over by myself and my family stayed in New Zealand.
"I stayed with a family in digs which was a new experience for me. On the field I got better but also off the field I was learning a lot and learning how to deal with certain situations which helped me a lot off the pitch.
"Their facilities were the best I had ever seen. It was a shock coming from New Zealand to see how good they were and at the time they were in the Premier League and it was among the best of the best in the world.
"It was a really big club to come to and some way to start my career and learn a lot from.
"It didn't work out for some reasons but I had a good time there and now it has helped me get to where I am now."
Despite his promise, a pathway to the Sunderland first team never seemed forthcoming and he opted to make the move to the Eredivisie for an undisclosed fee in 2018.
Woud was part of the Sunderland under-23 squad that reached the final of the Premier League International Cup in 2017. That squad also included the likes of Tommy Robson and Rees Greenwood - who had made their first team debuts under Sam Allardyce a year previously - before their gateway into the first team closed.
And Woud felt as if there was never a plan for him to progress at Sunderland and bemoaned the lack of a pathway for the club's young talent to break into the first team setup.
"I learned a lot. There was some coaches in the club who hold back players and I think that I wasn't given the same opportunities as I could say where I am now in Holland.
"I see a lot of players at Sunderland, and players there now that I know that had played for England at youth level to not playing anymore.
"For me, I couldn't wait around for an opportunity to come that I didn't think was going to come.
"Max [Stryjek] is now playing in the National League but he left quite old and I didn't want to do that.
"I chose to leave and I wanted to come to a place where I had an opportunity and they had a plan for me.
"The thing for me at Sunderland was there wasn't any plan. I can understand but there was no plan for me.
"If a keeper left the club they would always go out and buy a new keeper. I reached a point where I needed to be around first team players and play in front of crowds.
"For me, I didn't feel that was possible at Sunderland."
Nonetheless, Woud still insists he is grateful for the groundwork Sunderland put in place for his career now he is playing in the Eredivisie at Willem II.
The 21-year-old has largely played second fiddle to former Germany under-21 international goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther but has made five senior appearances for the Tilburg outfit.
After the suspension of the Eredivisie season, Willem II have qualified for next season's Europa League by virtue of being in fifth place before the league's suspension.
It means Woud is likely to have more first-team opportunities next season and he is excited about his future in the Netherlands.
"There are some good coaches [at Sunderland] but also coaches I feel like have been there too long but overall it was a great place to start my career," he continued.
"Some players in the under-23s are never going to get an opportunity. They keep signing and signing and before you know it they are 23/24.
"I wanted to go to a club where you are going to play and maybe it is a smaller club but you are going to get the opportunity to show yourself.
"The club had a lot of interest in me and they told me their plan for me.
"A lot of young players play in the league and maybe the Eredivisie isn't the biggest league but you are still playing PSV and Ajax who are really big clubs.
"It was the attraction of how much they wanted me and they had a plan for me.
"At Sunderland I found at 21/22 you were still sat in a changing room with 17-year-olds. I didn't want to do that.
"Willem is the best place for me now.
"Next season it is about being the number one here and getting more games.
"At 21, I would be the youngest goalkeeper in the league. After that it is about seeing what happens."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chatting with Coleman Stewart: American professional swimmer </h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Stewart is a two-time American Record holder and a two-time NCAA champion. "A proud moment for me was in 2018, I was part of a relay that broke the America Record in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). That was pretty special for me because we went a lot faster than many people thought," he said.
He opened up about the postponement of the Tokyo Olympic Games to 2021 due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. "I totally agree with the International Olympic Committee. It was the right decision," he said. "Personally, I think it was a really good idea. It doesn't really change my plans at all. It only shifts them another year."
In the meantime, he shared that he is "super excited" about the 2021 Olympic Trials. "I went back in 2016 and I am really excited to be back in Omaha in 2021. I think it will be a completely different experience for me," he said.
Stewart listed the backstroke as his personal favorite stroke in swimming. Each day, he is motivated by his teammates. "Knowing that all the rest of the guys on the team are in the same situation, and we are all in it together," he said. "It will be interesting to see how my motivation changes transitioning into a professional career, where I am swimming for myself and monetary gains. It will be interesting to see how it changes to sure."
On the impact of technology on the sport of swimming, he said, "Technology has changed a lot in the sport. With video review, that helps technique and it makes analysis easier. Also, tech suits have made it easier to swim fast, and tech suits help a lot."
Before his races, he noted that he tries to calm himself down since, at times, he gets a little too excited. "I try to tell myself that I put all the work in that I could, and I try to give myself some positive self-talk," he said.
For young and aspiring swimmers, he encouraged them to "put their heads down and enjoy it as much as they can." "When I was younger, I didn't enjoy swimming as much and I wanted to quit but my dad wouldn't let me, and obviously, I am super happy about that," he said. "Sticking through it was one of the best decisions that he made me make."
Regarding the title of the current chapter of his life, he said, "Looking forward to what's next."
During this pandemic, he offered the following inspiring message: "Try to stay positive. Find something that gives you happiness and positivity in your life. I am still able to work out a little bit so that gives me positivity and happiness."
Stewart defined the word success as "finding fulfillment in something that you find special."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The former Bok team-mate Erasmus would have loved to coach</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">South African Rugby DoR Rassie Erasmus has revealed the former team-mate he would love to have coached. In a new South African Rugby podcast Erasmus was asked which former colleague he would most like to have coached and his answer might surprise.

In fact, Erasmus ended up coaching a number of high profile teammates just a year after he retired in 2003, albeit in the Currie Cup.
“I was 32 when I stopped playing and the next year I coached the Currie Cup. In 2004 I played my last Currie Cup game and in the final against the Bulls, which we lost. The next year, I coached the Cheetahs in the Currie Cup final.
“So the previous year I was the captain. I played with Naka Drotske and Os du Randt and all of those guys, and then the next year I started coaching them, so that weird. There were two or three guys that were older than me in the team. That was at Currie Cup level, which took some getting used to.”
The now 47-year-old enjoyed a decade long career in the backrow, which saw him pick up 36 Springbok caps and gave him the chance to play with some now-legendary South African rugby names. However, his choice is a little leftfield.
Erasmus said he would have loved to coach Werner Swanepoel, who won 20-caps for the Springboks between 1997 and 2000. Swanepoel’s career coincided with the late, great Joost van der Westhuizen, and it ultimately limited how much game time he had on the pitch.
“At Springbok level, I think the most interesting person would be, because I know his personality, would be Werner Swanepoel, because he’s a nice person to be around and I know how good he is, we called him ‘Smiley’, he was my roommate always since we started playing together.

“He was in the Joost van der Westhuizen era, so Joost was always playing ahead of him most of the time. He was the kind of guy who always had time for a joke, a brilliant rugby player, a good team man – it would have been interesting to coach him. I don’t know if I would handle him so well. But yeah, that would have been a good one to coach.”
Swanepoel represented the Springboks in the 1999 Rugby World Cup, scoring a try in their pool match against Spain. Sadly Smiley’s career was ended unexpectedly when he contracted viral meningitis while he was playing with for Worcester Warriors in 2004.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Barcelona face paying Liverpool another €20m for Philippe Coutinho</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Barcelona face the prospect of paying Liverpool another €20m (£17.75m) for Philippe Coutinho next year if they cannot find a buyer for the Brazilian and he returns to the club.
Coutinho has been widely linked with a move away from Barcelona after an underwhelming first 18 months at the club and a disappointing loan spell at Bayern Munich this season.
The likes of Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal have been linked with moves to bring the 27-year-old back to the Premier League, but the coronavirus pandemic had made any deal less likely, with clubs struggling amid the economic uncertainty.
Barcelona would still want upwards of £60m for Coutinho, and after a forgettable season in the Bundesliga and his 28th birthday coming up in June, he is not necessarily an appealing prospect.
Barca are not immune to the economic uncertainty and are considering bringing Coutinho back into the fold rather than venturing into the transfer market themselves.
However, that will come at a cost in itself, as if the Brazilian makes another 24 appearances for the club, taking his total to 100, then Liverpool will be owed another £17.75m.
The Catalan side paid an initial fee of €120 for Coutinho in January 2017 and have paid a further €15m in add-ons since. However, there remains the potential for another €20m for reaching 100 appearances and an extra €5m if Barcelona were to win the Champions League.
While bringing Coutinho back to the Nou Camp may save Barcelona diving back into the transfer market, it is still likely to cost them money if he can rack up 24 appearances over a season, which seems probable.
Another possible route out of Barcelona for Coutinho could be Newcastle, a club that will have plenty of money to spend when their incoming Saudi Arabian owners have their takeover confirmed.
Rumours are flying of new managers and players, and Coutinho is on the list of targets, but is only likely to be persuaded if a high profile manager is appointed, such as key target Mauricio Pochettino.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sevilla interested in signing out of favour Chelsea midfielder</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to France Football, Sevilla have joined Paris Saint-Germain with an interest in signing Chelsea midfielder Timoue Bakayoko, the ace is currently on loan at Monaco.
Bakayoko joined the Blues from Monaco in the summer of 2017 for a fee of £40m, as per BBC Sport. The midfielder massively struggled during his debut season and things have gone further downhill since.
Once Maurizio Sarri became Chelsea boss in 2018, Bakayoko was loaned to AC Milan in a bid to rediscover the form that led to the west London outfit making him a marquee signing.
The France international was fairly impressive during his time at the San Siro, Bakayoko made 42 appearances for Milan last season.
The ace’s performances in Italy weren’t enough to convince new Chelsea manager Frank Lampard though, as the defensive midfielder has spent this season on loan with Monaco.
The 25-year-old has made 23 appearances for the Ligue 1 outfit this season, a permanent return doesn’t seem to be on the cards as France Football report that Monaco have rejected the option to re-sign Bakayoko for €42m.
It’s added that the Frenchman is still contracted to Chelsea until 2022 and that PSG see Bakayoko as one of the options to strengthen their midfield in the next transfer window.
France Football claim that Sevilla could step up their interest in Bakayoko in the ‘coming weeks’ if they secure Champions League qualification.
Sevilla are currently third in La Liga and it remains to be seen if Spanish football authorities will follow France’s example by cancelling the remainder of the season due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
With Bakayoko just 25 years old, he’s got plenty of time to prove that he’s a top player, unfortunately it seems highly unlikely that he’ll get a second chance to do this at Chelsea.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Barcelona 'outline terms for Tanguy Ndombele deal'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earlier this week, it was suggested that the Catalan giants were prepared to make a bid for the Frenchman, who has struggled during his first campaign in the Premier League.
While Ndombele has made 27 appearances in all competitions, just 12 starts have been made in England's top flight.
Should they give the green light to a sale, Spurs allegedly want to receive a fee close to the £65m which they paid last summer.
However, Sport claims that Barcelona will only firm up their initial interest if they can offload either Nelson Semedo or Samuel Umtiti as part of the deal.
Spurs are in the market for a new right-back and centre-back as they look to find long-term replacements for Kieran Trippier and Jan Vertonghen respectively.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boost for Man Utd for £120m-rated target as Euro rivals tipped to opt against making offer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Man Utd have reportedly been handed a major boost as Barcelona are being tipped to not make a bid to sign Borussia Dortmund starlet Jadon Sancho.
The 20-year-old has emerged as one of the top talents in Europe as he continues to flourish with the Bundesliga giants, having now bagged 31 goals and 42 assists in just 90 appearances.

Sancho has been heavily linked with a switch to Old Trafford, with the Sun reporting last month that a deal was almost agreed to take the England international back to Manchester after his previous stint with rivals Man City.
It promises to be an expensive swoop though, as the Evening Standard report that Sancho is valued at £120m by Dortmund, and so particularly with the financial impact of the coronavirus crisis in mind, it remains to be seen if clubs are still capable of splashing out big fees on their transfer targets this summer or if they are forced to put plans on hold until they recover from the financial hit that they’ve taken and will take in the coming months.
However, United could be buoyed by the latest reports in Spain, as it’s suggested by Mundo Deportivo that Barcelona won’t make a bid for Sancho having been linked with a swoop.
It’s reported that the Catalan giants believe that they’re well covered in attack and are looking at alternative targets, while his hefty price-tag could also be a factor too.
Man Utd are also specifically named in that report as being the club willing to go hard after Sancho, and so with less competition seemingly standing in their way with Barcelona not expected to rival them for his signature which could have significantly complicated their pursuit, it’s good news for the Red Devils as they’ll hope to secure a deal.
Sancho arguably fits the bill perfectly for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as he looks to build a talented, young and largely homegrown squad, but time will tell if they can convince Dortmund to green light an exit this summer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I called social media sprint sensations for trials to appear hands-on: Rijiju</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday conceded that calling for urgent trials for social media sprint sensations, seen running with buffaloes, were decisions taken under pressure to appear hands-on in his job.
Kambala jockey Srinivas Gowda of Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh's Rameshwar Gurjar hit national headlines last year for running in slushy and dusty fields respectively.
They were believed to have completed 100m sprints in 11 seconds, creating a flutter on social media platforms, where some dubbed them -- one after another -- the next Usain Bolt.
"In Madhya Pradesh somebody had a video of a village boy's running and posted it on social media, commented that he runs faster than Usain Bolt. When it became viral, I could have ignored it but suppose I don't react on that time, people will say the sports minister is silent, is not taking cognizance," he said.
In the trial though, Gurjar could not live up to the expectations and could barely complete the 100m distance in 12.9 seconds.
Rijiju added, "Shivraj Singh Chouhan also asked me to look into the matter. So I sent my SAI team to test the guy in Bhopal. I knew his capability but the country doesn't know what is the nature of sports. People just started saying he runs faster than Bolt and that is because lack of awareness."
"During the test he wouldn't even compete with the junior guys forget the seniors, he can't run even 13 seconds flat in 100m. He never trained, he was 25-26 so age was also not on his side, he didn't know how to wear spikes."
Rijiju also spoke about the story around Kambala jockey Gowda, whose exploits during a traditional buffalo race in Karnataka created a buzz on social media, forcing the minister to call the 28-year-old for a trail at the SAI, Bengaluru centre.
This was after after video clips of him running a distance of 100 metres in just 9.55 seconds have surfaced.
"Then 4-5 months back a news broke out that somebody broke Usain Bolt's record in a bull race in Karnataka. Even some of the professional people, some of the businessmen, some of the renowned people of India stated that now this guy will bring Olympic gold in 100m," Rijiju said.
"The problem is people don't have knowledge and understanding. If I don't respond then they will say the sports minister is silent.
"People must be thinking that what is the sports minister doing, he is responding to such kinds of amateur talks but I had to show sections who don't know sports that I am hands on with Indian sports and I am there for the athletes. I will give all the opportunities to all potentials, so I had to show that," he said.
The minister said it's high time people broaden their knowledge about sports other than cricket to enable India become a sporting powerhouse.
"Many people complained to me that government do not contribute or support enough for the development of sports in India. Let me make it very clear knowledge about sports in India is very, very low. People know only about cricket, people don't know about other sports," Rijiju said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sweat and saliva aren't big requirements in white-ball cricket, feels Jaydev Unadkat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: There is a raging debate on whether the use of sweat and saliva should be banned once cricket resumes after the COVID-19 pandemic but seamer Jaydev Unadkat feels that these components won't make much of a difference with white ball.
Unadkat, who has played 7 ODIs and 10 T20 Internationals for India, is a sought-after name in the IPL and plies his trade for Rajasthan Royals.
"I think white ball won't be a problem as a whole. Even in ODIs, you will be using two new balls 25 overs each. Reverse swing has never been a big factor in white-ball cricket. Even the new ball doesn't require any sweat or saliva as far as white ball is concerned," Unadkat said during an interaction.
The Ranji Trophy-winning Saurashtra captain said the reason behind that is that the quote of white lacquer requires little or no sweat or saliva for swing.

"White lacquer remains shiny even if you just rub it on your trousers while for red ball, the red lacquer and the red leather demands that we shine it more with saliva and sweat," the left-arm seamer said.
That's the reason, he feels, that in limited over contests, it will be a lesser risk for bowlers and can be started before one gets to the Test and first-class games.
"If we are starting with white-ball contests, we will surely have an advantage as saliva and sweat are as big a factor as it could be in red-ball cricket."
Even for red-ball cricket, Unadkat feels that precautions will be necessary only if cricket starts before the pandemic has subsided completely.
"If we start closed doors, then probably certain precautions will be mandatory."
Unadkat says that a prolonged break also means that he will be on even keel with some of the other bowlers who would be vying for their places in the Indian team for the World T20.
In fact, had the IPL started on March 29, Unadkat would have barely got three weeks rest after a gruelling domestic season where he carried the burden of Saurashtra bowling.
"To be honest, the big break evens out a lot of things as far as team selection is concerned. A lot will depend on who can carry the form through the break and who can come out sooner.
"You can't really judge now as you don't know how big the break will be. Even if I don't get match time sooner, if we get practice time sooner, it won't take much time to get back the rhythm."
While remaining fit has been a requirement, Unadkat has taken time out to pursue another vocation, which is learning guitar.
It was his fiancee Rinny who encouraged him to take up online guitar classes along with her.
"I had done a few classes in the past but then lost touch a couple of years back. Luckily my fiancee is also a guitar fan and has taken lessons in the past and both of us decided to enroll for online classes.
"Two notations that I am currently trying to pick up are Ben King's Stand By Me and John Legend's All of Me are some tunes that I am picking up. Still a little difficult," Unadkat said.
While the fingers strum the strings of the guitar, they also want to feel the seam of five and a half ounce of hard cherry.
"Now, after more than one month, I am missing being out there on the field and at the same time I know that we have not experienced anything like this before. I think we have to support each other as we go through this."

"To be honest, the big break evens out a lot of things as far as team selection is concerned. A lot will depend on can carry the form through the break and who can can come out sooner.
"You can't really judge now as you dont know how big the break will be. Even if I don't get match time sooner, if we get practice time sooner, it won't take much time to get back the rhythm."
While remaining fit has been a requirement, Unadkat has taken time out to pursue another vocation, which is learning guitar.
It was his fiancee Rinny who encouraged him to take up online guitar classes along with her.
"I had done a a few classes in the past but then lost touch a couple of years back. Luckily my fiancee is also a guitar fan and has taken lessons in the past and both of of us decided to enrol for online classes.
"Two notations that I am currently trying to pick up are Ben King's Stand By Me and John Legend's All of Me are some tunes that I am picking up. Still a little difficult," Unadkat said.
While the fingers strum the strings of guitar, they also want to feel the seam of five and half ounce of hard cherry.
"Now, after more than one month, I am missing being out there on the field and at the same time I know that we have not experienced anything like this before. I think we have to support each other as we go through this."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jaydev Unadkat Says Sweat And Saliva Aren't Big Requirements In White-Ball Cricket</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There is a raging debate on whether the use of sweat and saliva should be banned once cricket resumes after the COVID-19 pandemic but seamer Jaydev Unadkat feels that these components won't make much of a difference with white ball. Unadkat, who has played 7 ODIs and 10 T20 Internationals for India, is a sought-after name in the IPL and plies his trade for Rajasthan Royals. "I think white ball won't be a problem as a whole. Even in ODIs, you will be using two new balls 25 overs each. Reverse swing has never been a big factor in white-ball cricket. Even the new ball doesn't require any sweat or saliva as far as white ball is concerned," Unadkat told PTI during an interaction. 
The Ranji Trophy-winning Saurashtra captain said the reason behind that is that the quote of white lacquer requires little or no sweat or saliva for swing. 
"White lacquer remains shiny even if you just rub it on your trousers while for red ball, the red lacquer and the red leather demands that we shine it more with saliva and sweat," the left-arm seamer said. 
That's the reason, he feels, that in limited over contests, it will be a lesser risk for bowlers and can be started before one gets to the Test and first-class games. 
"If we are starting with white-ball contests, we will surely have an advantage as saliva and sweat are as big a factor as it could be in red-ball cricket." 
Even for red-ball cricket, Unadkat feels that precautions will be necessary only if cricket starts before the pandemic have subsided completely. 
"If we start closed doors, then probably certain precautions will be mandatory."
Unadkat says that a prolonged break also means that he will be on even keel with some of the other bowlers who would be vying for their places in the Indian team for the World T20.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stopping use of sweat, saliva for shining balls won’t affect white-ball cricket: Jaydev Unadkat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Weighing in on the debate on whether the use of sweat and saliva should be banned once cricket resumes after the Covid-19 pandemic, Indian seamer Jaydev Unadkat said that these aspects won’t make much of a difference with white ball.
Unadkat, who has played seven ODIs and 10 T20 Internationals for India, is a sought-after name in the IPL and has been a part of the Rajasthan Royals franchise over the last few years.
“I think white ball won’t be a problem as a whole. Even in ODIs, you will be using two new balls 25 overs each. Reverse swing has never been a big factor in white-ball cricket. Even the new ball doesn’t require any sweat or saliva as far as white ball is concerned,” Unadkat told PTI.
The Ranji Trophy-winning Saurashtra captain said the reason behind that is that the coat of white lacquer requires little or no sweat or saliva for swing.
“White lacquer remains shiny even if you just rub it on your trousers while for red ball, the red lacquer and the red leather demands that we shine it more with saliva and sweat,” the left-arm seamer said.
That’s the reason, he feels, that in limited-overs formats, it will be a lesser risk for bowlers and can be started before one gets to the Test and first-class games.
“If we are starting with white-ball contests, we will surely have an advantage as saliva and sweat are not as big a factor as it could be in red-ball cricket.”
Even for red-ball cricket, Unadkat feels that precautions will be necessary only if cricket starts before the pandemic have subsided completely.
“If we start closed doors, then probably certain precautions will be mandatory,” he added.

In fact, had the IPL started on March 29, Unadkat would have barely got three weeks rest after a gruelling domestic season where he carried the burden of Saurashtra bowling.
“To be honest, the big break evens out a lot of things as far as team selection is concerned. A lot will depend on [whether one] can carry the form through the break and who can can come out sooner.
“You can’t really judge now as you dont know how big the break will be. Even if I don’t get match time sooner, if we get practice time sooner, it won’t take much time to get back the rhythm,” he added.

“I had done a a few classes in the past but then lost touch a couple of years back. Luckily my fiancee is also a guitar fan and has taken lessons in the past and both of of us decided to enrol for online classes,” he said.
Ultimately, he wanted to get back on the field soon.
“Now, after more than one month, I am missing being out there on the field and at the same time I know that we have not experienced anything like this before. I think we have to support each other as we go through this,” the pacer added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The thought of standing up to Brett Lee's thunderbolts had taken Rohit Sharma's "sleep away" when he first started out but among the current lot, Josh Hazlewood is one speedster the India swashbuckler "doesn't want to face" in Tests.
Rohit said he will have to be mentally prepared to face Hazlewood when India tour Australia for a Test series later this year, provided the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.
Asked to name the toughest pacers he has faced so far, Rohit said, "One bowler is Brett Lee because he didn't let me sleep the previous night on my first tour to Australia in 2007, as I was thinking how to play this bowler who bowls in excess of 150 kmph."
"In 2007, Brett Lee was at his peak. I used to watch him closely and noticed that he was consistently bowling at the speed of around 150-155 kmph. The thought of a youngster like me facing that kind of speed took away my sleep," Rohit said of the former Australian speed merchant on Star Sports' 'Cricket Connected'.
Since making his debut in 2007 as a precocious talent, Rohit has gone on to become one of the world's most prolific batsmen, and his exploits in limited overs cricket are second to none.
Rohit has racked up 29 ODI hundreds and six centuries in Test cricket, besides four three-figure mark in the T20 Internationals.
"Currently, someone whom I don't want to face in Test cricket would be Josh Hazlewood because he's disciplined and does not move away from that length. He does not give you loose balls," he said.
Among the retired lot, Rohit said South African pace great Dale Steyn has also given him nightmares because of his ability to swing the ball at great speed.
"I have two retired favourite bowlers who I never wanted to face, one was Brett Lee and the other was Dale Steyn. I never wanted to face Steyn because playing pace and swing at the same time was a nightmare, it was just unreal."
Rohit said he continues to face quality bowlers in the present day with Hazlewood being among the best .
"I have watched him enough to understand that. I know for a fact that if I have to go to Australia to play a Test, then I have to be mentally prepared to be disciplined while facing Josh," said the scorer of three double hundreds in ODIs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rashford can reach the level of Mbappe and compete for the Ballon d’Or, says Darmian</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rashford can reach the same level as Kylian Mbappe and go on to win the Ballon d'Or, according to former Manchester United team-mate Matteo Darmian.
Rashford has enjoyed his most productive season in terms of goals in 2019-20, scoring 19 in all competitions for the Red Devils despite being sidelined since January due to a back injury.
The England international burst onto the scene early in 2016 under Louis van Gaal, finding the net twice on both his Europa League and Premier League debuts after coming through the club's academy system.
Darmian, however, is not surprised at the 22-year-old's continued development since then, having seen at close quarters just how good the forward is.
"I still remember Marcus Rashford's first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday. I immediately thought, 'wow, this is an incredible player'," he told the Guardian.
"He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me."
The Italian defender, who returned to his homeland last September by signing for Parma, feels the England international can still get even better, too.
Darmian feels Rashford has the potential to match Paris Saint-Germain superstar Mbappe, the pair perhaps competing for individual honours for many years to come.
"If he [Rashford] continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d'Or winner. I'm convinced of this," he said.
"He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he's very young and can still improve. For me, he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappe and compete for the Ballon d’Or for years to come."
The full-back worked under Van Gaal and Jose Mourinho during his time at Old Trafford, as well as current boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
"I can only speak well about Solskjaer, believe me," Darmian said of the Norwegian. "I would give him a long-term contract.
"He's a very prepared coach and Manchester United has started this project, this journey, with many young players, many British players and they will continue with this project.
"Because of the person I got to know, I hope Solskjaer has success at the club."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former coach tips sensation to sign for Real Madrid</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This season may go down in history for a lot of the wrong reasons, but it’s easy to forget that a lot of fans won’t have known much about Erling Haaland last Summer.
Football Manager players will all claim they saw him first, but he merely looked like a promising striker at Red Bull Salzburg – but 28 goals in 22 games established him as a worldwide sensation.
He also impressed in the Champions League, and he stepped up to the Bundesliga with ease and had struck 12 times in 11 Dortmund games before play was forced to stop.
Every club in the world wants a goalscorer with figures like that, so it’s expected he will be linked with a big move every window until he ends up at an elite club.
A report from AS has looked at the possibility of him landing at Real Madrid, and a former coach clearly thinks it could happen.
Stanislav Macek worked with the youngster when he spent some time with the Salzburg players and was clearly impressed with the big Norwegian striker.
He’s been impressed by his development and thinks he’s destined to make it to a bigger club soon – one like Real Madrid.
Karim Benzema is getting older and Luka Jovic has shown he’s not the answer at the Bernabeu, so it’s easy to see Real looking for a new striker soon, and Haaland could be perfect.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crucible characters day 16: Mark Allen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For every Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry, snooker also boasted its bit-part players: the what-might-have-beens and never-minds, who left their own small but indelible mark upon the sport.
For the duration of the postponed World Championships, the PA news agency is turning its focus on the Crucible characters who never quite made the competition’s last three days.
The 34-year-old from Northern Ireland has cut a controversial figure on the circuit since his World Championship debut in 2007, but is yet to summon a Crucible performance to put his off-table antics in the shade.
Allen has, variously, sparked a feud with Stuart Bingham after claiming his opponent had “no bottle”, engaged in a running battle with Barry Hearn over changes to the snooker calendar, and set about taking on a few billion Chinese snooker aficionados single-handedly.
During the 2012 World Open in Haikou, Allen sent an infamous and swiftly deleted tweet in which he derided the tournament and its associated facilities.
At the World Championships in the same year, Allen branded opponent Cao Yupeng a “cheat” for not calling a foul, and broadened the subject of his ire by adding: “It seems to be a bit of a trait for the Chinese players.”
A fresh-faced Allen had reached the Crucible semi-finals on his third appearance in 2009, including an epic second round win over Ronnie O’Sullivan, and has featured in three more subsequent last eights.
But despite winning five ranking tournaments, reaching the UK Championships final and claiming a breakthrough Masters title in 2018, his inconsistency has cost him dear.
Entering the Crucible just months after his Masters triumph and with his time seemingly set to arrive, he was dumped out in the first round by Zhou Yuelong. – of China.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stephen Hendry explains why Kyren Wilson can win the World Snooker Championship</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Stephen Hendry has backed Kyren Wilson to win a World Snooker Championship, believing his game is suited to the epic slog at the Crucible Theatre.
The world number eight has been consistently good at the event over the last four years, reaching a semi-final and three quarter-finals, but not yet reaching the showpiece match in Sheffield.
The Warrior only has one ranking title to his name, winning the German Masters last season, but Hendry feels his attitude is ideal for the World Championship and can see him lifting the sport’s biggest prize in the near future.
‘Someone like Kyren Wilson could win the World Championship because he gives it absolutely everything and he believes he can win it,’ Hendry told Ronnie O’Sullivan on Instagram Live.
The Rocket agreed, simply saying, ‘Definitely.’
Wilson has had a middling season so far, reaching the finals of the Welsh Open and Gibraltar Open, but not adding to his collection of titles.
He is set to head to the World Championship in July as a seeded player for the fourth straight year and will be relishing another crack at the 17-day marathon.
Speaking ahead of last year’s World Championship, the Kettering man made it clear he is very confident of lifting the trophy in South Yorkshire at some point in his career.
‘I have been so desperate and chasing wins so much it’s crazy,’ Wilson told BBC Sport.
‘I am only 27 [now 28]. Some of the players winning are in their 40s and creeping up to their mid-40s. Look at Mark Williams who won the Worlds last year. Anything can happen.
‘Hopefully I have a long future in the game and will be appearing at the Crucible for a long time to come so I am not going to rush it.
‘If I win it fantastic, if I don’t then I am sure my time will come.’
Wilson failed to qualify for the Tour Championship, which WST are still planning to play before the World Championship this summer.
The next time he competes will be in Sheffield, where he is currently rated at 20/1 with tournament sponsors Betfred to win his first world title.

Allen has, variously, sparked a feud with Stuart Bingham after claiming his opponent had "no bottle", engaged in a running battle with Barry Hearn over changes to the snooker calendar, and set about taking on a few billion Chinese snooker aficionados single-handedly.
During the 2012 World Open in Haikou, Allen sent an infamous and swiftly deleted tweet in which he derided the tournament and its associated facilities.
At the World Championships in the same year, Allen branded opponent Cao Yupeng a "cheat" for not calling a foul, and broadened the subject of his ire by adding: "It seems to be a bit of a trait for the Chinese players."
A fresh-faced Allen had reached the Crucible semi-finals on his third appearance in 2009, including an epic second round win over Ronnie O'Sullivan, and has featured in three more subsequent last eights.
But despite winning five ranking tournaments, reaching the UK Championships final and claiming a breakthrough Masters title in 2018, his inconsistency has cost him dear.
Entering the Crucible just months after his Masters triumph and with his time seemingly set to arrive, he was dumped out in the first round by Zhou Yuelong. – of China.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A 'Bool carnival like no other - but all the stars will be there</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">So riotous is the the party atmosphere when the races are on that the Warrnambool May carnival is regularly referred to as Schoolies Week for the over-40s.
But this week the seaside track and the bars, pubs and restaurants around Warrnambool's centre will be shuttered and the atmosphere around the town quieter than it's ever been when the festival is staged.
The 'Bool will, however, set a record of its own on Tuesday when it stages an entire day of just jumps racing.
Five hurdle races and three steeplechases will be staged, with the Brierley Steeple, the Grand Annual and the Galleywood Hurdle the headline attractions.
On the Wednesday of a truncated two-day carnival the flat racers will hog the headlines, with the Wangoom Handicap - often referred to as the Newmarket of the bush - and the Warrnambool Cup the main features.
All the top jumps riders - men like Steven Pateman, Shane Jackson and Tom Ryan - will be in action on Tuesday, while top jumps trainers such as Ciaron Maher and David Eustace, Eric Musgrove and Patrick Payne will saddle up leading contenders.
The economic impact of the ban on spectators will hit both the town and the track hard, but Tom O'Connor, the CEO of the Warrnambool Turf Club, is grateful that the meeting can go ahead at all.
There were complaints from the local council that staging the festival might present a health risk for the town, but O'Connor says strict observation of the coronavirus protocols under which racing has managed to keep going for the past six weeks should ensure risk is minimised.
''The key point was communicating broadly the strict protocols that we are adhering to on Tuesday and Wednesday. They have been put out there to the public and also through to council.
''We are very confident based on the measures that the industry has put in place that it will be a safe secure venue for the participants on both days.''
O'Connor says that despite the lockdown and lack of fans sponsors and patrons have remained loyal.
''Those who have bought hospitality packages and tickets all been offered entry next year. We have worked on a 'commit to the 'Bool in '21 strategy', so a lot of the efforts have gone into transferring clients' business from 2020 to 2021.
''We have offered refunds where people have preferred that option but we have had some amazing support from people that come to the Bool on a regular basis. They are committing to next year and are getting behind us.
''Its been similar with our business partners being able to continue to race on the two days. We have also received some fantastic support from our sponsors who have stuck with us even though times are tough for them too.''
There are eight runners or more in seven of the eight runners, allowing each way betting on the first three to finish in each race, and O'Connor is delighted with the field sizes.
''This is a first for the club having a full day of jumps, so it was always a bit of an unknown as to the support that would be out there.
''There's also been a revised jumps programme through April with Oakbank not going ahead, so there's a flow on effect there.
''But I think to have the fields we have got is great, and particularly the quality is a highlight, especially in a couple of the features. It should be a great spectacle.''

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CHICAGO — When Jesse Smith looks out at his Zoom audience, he knows exactly what the crowd is going through.
The captain of the U.S. men’s water polo team is adjusting his training, too. He also misses playing alongside his friends.
One way Smith is dealing with the coronavirus pandemic is through virtual speaking engagements with water polo clubs and teams all over the country, passing along what he has learned during a couple decades in the water.
The 37-year-old Smith is one of several Olympic athletes who have been using digital avenues to help their sport during the shutdown. While Zoom sessions are a frequent choice, some athletes are offering training tips on Instagram and Olympic federations are pitching in with newsletters and other web-based help.
“We're all as athletes affected the same way,” Smith said. “Even though I'm a four-time Olympian, a silver medal (winner), training for my fifth Olympics, the captain of my team, the same thing is going on in my head as a 16-year-old that got their (season) canceled, and I think that I have more tools available, so I'm trying to share that."
Beach volleyball star Kerri Walsh Jennings has been doing online talks with young volleyball players, including one with the team at her alma mater of Archbishop Mitty High School in California. U.S. wrestlers Mallory Velte, Pat Smith and Yianni Diakomihalis detailed their at-home workouts in a post on the federation website. Casey Patterson and April Ross were among a group of beach volleyball players who shared workout tips during Facebook live sessions on the AVP page.
The federations also are reaching out. USA Water Polo has been sending out a weekly newsletter called “At Home with USA Water Polo” featuring interviews with coaches and athletes. U.S. Rowing has been holding webinars for its members. USA Volleyball has a page on its website with COVID-19-related resources.
“A lot of people look to (us) in the athlete world, in our communities, for us to kind of be a voice. Like, how are we going to respond? What actions are we taking?” said U.S. softball pitcher Monica Abbott, who has been doing speaking engagements with young softball players and holding pitching-inspired workout sessions.
The effort by Olympic athletes and federations comes amid concern about the future of college sports. Some Olympic sports could be on the chopping block for athletic departments looking to save money after losing revenue due to the COVID-19 shutdown.
“I wouldn't say that that's something I'm focusing on, but it's definitely something that's in my mind and helps me plan for these,” U.S. water polo center Matt Farmer said, “because I'm taking an optimistic view of what's going to happen in college water polo, because it means so much to so many people.”
Farmer, a 24-year-old Chicago native who played on three NCAA championship teams at UCLA, is focusing his outreach efforts on the Midwest. California is the home of American water polo, but Farmer is hoping he can help some young players follow in his footsteps.
“I kind of blazed a trail from Chicago to international water polo,” Farmer said, “and I want to share my experiences with people and maybe give advice to people who are thinking about playing in college or continuing the sport and just want to grow as players and as people.”
The online conversations usually touch on a variety of topics. There are the usual practical tips for playing the sport at a high level, but there also are elements of sports psychology — especially with young players away from their teams and searching for motivation.
Walsh Jennings, a three-time Gold medalist, said the calls have become a highlight of her day.
“We're all feeling the same frustrations and longings,” she said. “It's pretty special to be able to speak to the fact that we're not alone in this and that it is up to each of us to make the best of what we have to work with — to focus on that which we can control.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Teqball - the game keeping soccer stars busy during lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Harry Maguire, Sadio Mane and Wayne Rooney are among the stars to have embraced teqball during the coronavirus lockdown — a mixture of football and table tennis that has quickly grown from a Hungarian garage to a burgeoning international sport.
What has long been a common sight at training grounds is increasingly becoming more frequent in players’ gardens as they look for a fun and challenging way of filling the void left by the Covid-19 lockdown.
From Neymar to England internationals such as Trent Alexander-Arnold, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Tammy Abraham, numerous players past and present are embracing teqball at a time when the footballing landscape has been decimated.
“We miss football and all the players miss football — everyone misses football,” Viktor Huszar, one of three co-founders and inventors of teqball explains.
“This is just bringing back a piece, a little piece of football with teqball, joyful things.
“We see now, if you check Sadio Mane’s last picture, you see the football goals, all the different exercises... and the teqball table there.
“The same happens with many of the players that you see as part of their everyday training routine. This is how they keep up.”
The sport is the brainchild of former semi-professional player Gabor Borsanyi and Huszar, who took their love for football and adapted it to their limitations in terms of time, numbers and space by using a curved table tennis-style table to face one another.
During the current crisis, players have been training by folding the teqball table and playing off half of it, with the federation offering half-priced tables to Professional Footballers’ Association members.
Initially played between friends in a small garage in Hungary, continual positive feedback led the first prototype tables to be developed in 2014 and within three years the Federation Internationale de Teqball (FITEQ) was established.
The big moment came in 2015 when Barcelona great and current Holland manager Ronald Koeman gave the sport the thumbs up.
“Southampton, that’s the first table we have in the Premier League, ” the FITEQ chairman said, having visited the then Saints boss and assistant Erwin Koeman, the ex-Hungary manager.
“We never really pushed teqball, we just had some people and we asked what Ronald Koeman says because he is an experienced coach.
“When they said (they liked it), like Henk Ten Cate from Barcelona, Chelsea and Ajax, and Koeman, then we said ‘OK, if they say this is good and they worked with Messi and all these guys, then this actually really works’.
“That’s when we started to push it more as a structured organisation and then it went from one Premier League club to the other, one player to the other.
“And now, as I remember, we had 18 out of the 20 Premier League clubs or players using it, so sometimes I even say that probably teqball is the most advanced sports equipment with the Premier League clubs.”
Increasing numbers of players are embracing teqball and the third annual teqball world championships was held in December, just months before coronavirus changed the sporting world.
“We see that teqball is really a sports equipment that has the social distance type of sport,” Huszar said.
“Actually, the table is designed with three metres length, so you’re always minimum, three, three-and-a-half metres from each other.
“Teqball is about developing your touch and your cognitive skills because you have to make such quick decisions that you’re under pressure all the time.
“When you look at a football game, especially when you look at the youth football game, I mean, how many touches do you have for your kid? You know, maybe he touches 12 or 20 times during the game.
“But even Premier League players, they need that perfect touch and in teqball you get used to that — you literally get it every second and you just have to make sure that you have a quick reaction before you touch the ball.
“So, and I play teqball actively, like every day, for me this is a 50 per cent mental cognitive improvement and also basically just perfecting your skill and touch and coordination, balance on a very short platform.”
Teqball is growing as a sport as much as a recreational activity, with more than 50 national federations formed and 160 athletes from 57 countries at the most recent world championships.
“Now I see the pictures and the videos, and it is surreal,” Huszar added. “But certainly the early moments were the incredible ones
“I’m quite sure that teqball is still a very early stage sport because I also look at it as a sport. In terms of the development, it’s hard to keep up with that.
“I think that it’s unstoppable, so sometimes I even made jokes with the other two co-founders that, look, whatever we do, we don’t really have the chance to stop it.”

“Actually, the table is designed with three metres length, so you’re always minimum, three, three-and-a-half metres from each other.
“Teqball is about developing your touch and your cognitive skills because you have to make such quick decisions that you’re under pressure all the time.
“When you look at a football game, especially when you look at the youth football game, I mean, how many touches do you have for your kid? You know, maybe he touches 12 or 20 times during the game.
“But even Premier League players, they need that perfect touch and in teqball you get used to that – you literally get it every second and you just have to make sure that you have a quick reaction before you touch the ball.
“So, and I play teqball actively, like every day, for me this is a 50 per cent mental cognitive improvement and also basically just perfecting your skill and touch and coordination, balance on a very short platform.”
Players have been training by folding the teqball table and playing off half of it, with the federation offering half-priced tables to Professional Footballers’ Association members during the lockdown.
Teqball is growing as a sport as much as a recreational activity, with more than 50 national federations formed and 160 athletes from 57 countries at the most recent world championships.
“Now I see the pictures and the videos, and it is surreal,” Huszar added. “But certainly the early moments were the incredible ones
“I’m quite sure that teqball is still a very early stage sport because I also look at it as a sport.
“In terms of the development, it’s hard to keep up with that.
“I think that it’s unstoppable, so sometimes I even made jokes with the other two co-founders that, look, whatever we do, we don’t really have the chance to stop it.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League stars turn to Teqball in football's absence</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What has long been a common sight at training grounds is increasingly becoming more frequent in players' gardens as they look for a fun and challenging way of filling the void left by the Covid-19 lockdown.
From Neymar to England internationals such as Trent Alexander-Arnold, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Tammy Abraham, numerous players past and present are embracing teqball at a time when the footballing landscape has been decimated.
"We miss football and all the players miss football – everyone misses football," Viktor Huszar, one of three co-founders and inventors of teqball, told the PA news agency.
"This is just bringing back a piece, a little piece of football with teqball, joyful things.
"We see now, if you check Sadio Mane's last picture, you see the football goals, all the different exercises... and the teqball table there.
"The same happens with many of the players that you see as part of their everyday training routine. This is how they keep up."
The sport is the brainchild of former semi-professional player Gabor Borsanyi and Huszar, who took their love for football and adapted it to their limitations in terms of time, numbers and space by using a curved table tennis-style table to face one another.
Initially played between friends in a small garage in Hungary, continual positive feedback led the first prototype tables to be developed in 2014 and within three years the Federation Internationale de Teqball (FITEQ) was established.
The big moment came in 2015 when Barcelona great and current Holland manager Ronald Koeman gave the sport the thumbs up.
"Southampton, that's the first table we have in the Premier League," the FITEQ chairman said, having visited the then Saints boss and assistant Erwin Koeman, the ex-Hungary manager.
"We never really pushed teqball, we just had some people and we asked what Ronald Koeman says because he is an experienced coach.
"When they said (they liked it), like Henk Ten Cate from Barcelona, Chelsea and Ajax, and Koeman, then we said 'OK, if they say this is good and they worked with Messi and all these guys, then this actually really works'.
"That's when we started to push it more as a structured organisation and then it went from one Premier League club to the other, one player to the other.
"And now, as I remember, we had 18 out of the 20 Premier League clubs or players using it, so sometimes I even say that probably teqball is the most advanced sports equipment with the Premier League clubs."
Increasing numbers of players are embracing teqball and the third annual teqball world championships was held in December, just months before coronavirus changed the sporting world.
"We see that teqball is really a sports equipment that has the social distance type of sport," Huszar said.
"Actually, the table is designed with three metres length, so you're always minimum, three, three-and-a-half metres from each other.

    <h5 class="mb-1">McEvoy backs Vorster tactics, says Sunlight simply didn't turn up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Top trainer Tony McEvoy has slammed the critics who found fault with his jockey's tactics on beaten favourite Sunlight in Saturday's group 1 TAB Classic at Morphettville, declaring the top race mare had trailed in last because she simply decided to down tools and have a day off.
The trainer/jockey combination of McEvoy and Barend Vorster had landed two group 2 races earlier in the day, so their confidence was up and they opted for a radical approach to keep Sunlight wide on the track as she had to jump from barrier 14 in a 16-horse field.
But, explained McEvoy on Sunday, the now four-year-old has lost a little of her gate speed and is not as sharp as she once was, especially at the start of a sprint race like the 1200-metre Classic. Therefore the stable and the rider opted to try something different.
"For some reason she has decided not to go. All the people on Twitter and everyone saying the tactics were wrong and blaming Barend Vorster is completely ridiculous. That filly went in a straight line and was beaten before he started to turn, it's just rubbish," McEvoy said.
"We made a plan and it didn't work. It wasn't because of where we were on the track, it was simply that she decided not to have a go.
"She is not showing the speed she used to show, we know that. She showed in the Golden Eagle [a $7 million race over 1500 metres in which she finished second last spring] she's not [just] a sprinter any more.
"The problem with that was that at the 600m mark before we started to turn she was gone. He had no horse under him."
Vorster is the trainer's Adelaide stable rider and McEvoy is delighted with his overall contribution.
"Barend is really going well. He's such an asset to my team not only at the races but every day of the week with his feedback, he's got a great work ethic and I am so pleased with him."
Saturday aside, the trainer is undeterred and will almost certainly press on to the final group 1 race of the Adelaide carnival, the Goodwood on May 16, with Sunlight.
"I cannot find one reason [for her poor run]. She's perfect this morning, we trotted her up, flexed her up, looked over her, I looked at her closer this morning than I have looked at my wife for years," he joked.
"She's had a day off. Straight after the race the vets came and took her heart rate, it was under 120. Then it was under 100 soon after that. She didn't go. She did that in The Everest too. She had a shocker in The Everest.
"I will do some internal testing on her with a lung wash and we shall take some bloods, but she has eaten a maximum feed overnight, bright as a button this morning [Sunday] and has pulled up like a winner.
"She did it [put in a shocker] on the biggest day of her life in The Everest. I couldn't find a thing wrong and then she went to the Golden Eagle and ran probably the race of her life.
"If she's fine I am just going to go to the Goodwood and then we will make a decision after that about what we do."
McEvoy has a handful of other chances in the big races over the next fortnight.
"Silent Sovereign had no luck at all yesterday in the Oaks and I am considering backing her up in the Derby next weekend. Xilong won the Euclase Stakes and I think I will run her in the Goodwood."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Sunil Chhetri has helped a fan get free Netflix subscription and a personally signed jersey after the latter requested the Indian football team captain and star striker to share his user ID and password.
Taking to Twitter, Chhetri had posted a screenshot of a message he received on Facebook and wrote: "Jersey X Autograph on a picture X Reply to the post X Video wishing the neighbour's son's pet dog X. Here's someone who has priorities straight and it's really making me want to consider the demand."
Netflix India's Twitter handle took note of this message from Chhetri and they replied: "While we on that topic, could we also get your autograph on a picture?"

Chhetri then proposed a barter deal asking for a two-month free subscription for the fan in return for an autographed jersey from him.
His post read: "In the true spirit of a barter, how about you guys hand the kid a two-month subscription and I will send a signed shirt and a picture your way? Do we have a deal?"
In reply, Netflix India's Twitter handle posted: "How about we send him both the jersey and a subscription card? Let's make his day."
To this, Chhetri replied: "Sounds great guys, now that we've got this figured out. Subscription for the kid, Shirt for the kid, Shirt for you guys."
Earlier, in a series of tweets, Chhetri had announced that the members of the Indian team had come together and 'put on table a sum that has been sent to the PM-Cares Fund' to help in the fight against coronavirus.

"It's been heartening to see everyone -- cutting across caps, goals, age and experience -- give, and give with a smile. When word got out, even some who have long stopped pulling on an India shirt, turned up and asked to be counted.
"That's what a team is all about. The ONLY reason we're talking about this here is so that it can gently prod those who have been fortunate enough to get, to give back. We're in this together," he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sunil Chhetri Cracks Barter Deal To Fulfill Fan's Bizarre Wish</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Indian football team captain Sunil Chhetri, a day after sharing the screenshot of a bizarre request made by one of his fans, cracked a barter deal with a popular OTT platform, thus fulfilling his rather bizarre request. On Saturday Chhetri's fan had asked him to share his Netflix ID and password with him during the lockdown. Reacting to Chhetri's tweet, Netflix India wrote: "While we're on the topic, could we also get your autograph on a picture?". Chhetri took the opportunity to hand Netflix a barter deal of a signed shirt, in return for a two-month free subscription for his fan. "In the true spirit of a barter, how about you guys hand the kid a two-month subscription and I'll send a signed shirt and a picture your way? Do we have a deal?," Chhetri tweeted.
While the free subscription would have made Chhetri's fan really happy, Netflix India decided to hand him a double bonanza and make his day even more special by sending him the signed jersey along with the free subscription.
"How about we send him both the jersey and a subscription card? Let's make his day. Slide tackling into your DMs so we can figure out how to do this," the OTT platform replied from their official Twitter handle.
In the end, India's top international goal-scorer decided to send two signed shirt -- one for his fan and the other one for the Netflix India.
Here's how the whole conversation unfolded on the micro-blogging site:
Recently, Chhetri was picked among 28 past and present stars for FIFA's campaign to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. 
FIFA and the World Health Organization (WHO) teamed up to combat the coronavirus by launching a new awareness campaign led by world-renowned footballers, who are calling on all people around the world to follow five key steps to stop the spread of the disease. 
Chhetri also featured in an Asian Football Confederation (AFC) campaign to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and requested people to do all they can to overcome "these challenging times". 
Chhetri is only behind Cristiano Ronaldo and leads the likes of mega superstars such as Lionel Messi in the international goalscoring charts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fergus McFadden To Retire At End Of The Season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Leinster Rugby back Fergus McFadden has announced his decision to retire from professional rugby at the end of the season.
Speaking to Peter O’Reilly in today’s Sunday Times, the 184 times capped Kildare native confirmed his decision to retire whenever the 2019/20 season concludes.
McFadden made his debut for Leinster Rugby in the number 13 jersey against Cardiff Blues in September 2007, but over the course over the next 13 years, McFadden would play in numerous positions and this versatility was one of the traits that head coach Leo Cullen was keen to praise when looking back on McFadden’s career on the Leinster Rugby website.
“Fergus has been an amazing contributor to lots of great things that have taken place in Leinster and Irish rugby and he’s definitely one of the great characters that we’ve had around in the group.
“The versatility piece that Fergus has is hugely important. It can go against some players and tough calls not going their way but he would always do what’s best for the team. For example, even though typically your ten would take kicks, Fergus had no problem stepping up at crucial moments to take the pressure off someone. He had so many strings to his bow and he’s going to be a great loss to the group.”
McFadden made his Ireland debut against Italy in the 2011 Six Nations and went on to win a further 33 caps for Ireland scoring ten tries.
While acknowledging his retirement, the two-time Heineken Cup winner thanked his teammates and the fans for their support.
“They say the best time to leave a party is when you’re still having fun so the time has come for me to announce my retirement from the end of the season. It’s hard to put into words what a privilege it has been to have had such a long career playing for the team I grew up supporting and pulling on a green jersey to play for my country. It has been a dream come true.
“So, reflecting on what made this all possible, I would like to thank all the Leinster Rugby staff, Leo Cullen, the wider management team, medics, physios, strength & conditioning coaches, backroom staff and our legendary bagman Johnny O’Hagan. Leinster’s incredible success over many years has been as a result of the contributions of the entire team both on and off the field.
“To the players, there are too many for me to name individually right now but all I can say is that it has been an honour to play and work alongside such incredibly talented and professional people. The friendships and memories I have made are ones I will cherish for the rest of my life – not to mention the many laughs we had along the way!
“To the Leinster fans…I don’t think you could ask for better supporters. Your constant support and encouragement was felt throughout – not only there to celebrate the highs but also to support through the lows.
“To my wife Rebecca, my son Freddy, my parents, my friends and family, thanks for being there every step of the way.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fergus McFadden retires from rugby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Leinster Rugby back Fergus McFadden has this morning announced his decision to retire from professional rugby at the end of the season. Speaking to Peter O’Reilly in today’s Sunday Times, the 184 times capped Kildare native confirmed his decision to retire whenever the 2019/20 season concludes.

McFadden made his debut for Leinster Rugby in the number 13 jersey against Cardiff Blues in September 2007, but of course over the next 13 years, McFadden would play in numerous positions and this versatility was one of the traits that Leinster Rugby Head Coach Leo Cullen was keen to praise when looking back on McFadden’s career.
“Fergus has been an amazing contributor to lots of great things that have taken place in Leinster and Irish rugby and he’s definitely one of the great characters that we’ve had around in the group.
RugbyPass takes you behind the scenes at the 2018 PRO14 final:
“The versatility piece that Fergus has is hugely important. It can go against some players and tough calls not going their way but he would always do what’s best for the team. For example, even though typically your ten would take kicks, Fergus had no problem stepping up at crucial moments to take the pressure off someone. He had so many strings to his bow and he’s going to be a great loss to the group.”
To underline his importance to the Leinster cause, in his 184 games to date, McFadden has scored 29 tries but also kicked 46 conversions, 68 penalties and even a drop-goal against Cardiff in 2011.
His form in the blue of Leinster was rewarded with an Ireland debut against Italy in the 2011 Six Nations and he would go on to win a further 33 caps for Ireland scoring ten tries.
Over the course of a glittering career McFadden contributed to some great days for Leinster and Ireland and his standing within the environment of Leinster was also acknowledged by Cullen this morning.

“When the Ireland Rugby World Cup squad was announced during the year we posed some questions to the group of players that were left behind to form a leadership group and Fergus came out very high in that process and is still in that leadership group currently.
“That leadership group is based off some questions that we would ask the wider playing group. What do they value? Who lives those values day in, day out? Who do they want in the dressing room sitting beside them?
“You always had a sense for how highly Fergus was regarded amongst his peers and this process just confirmed what we already thought.”
During his time at Leinster, McFadden contributed on the biggest of days including playing in the 2011 Heineken Cup Final against Northampton Saints and starting in the 2012 Heineken Cup Final against Ulster, the 2013 Challenge Cup Final and the 2013 and 2014 PRO12 Finals.
He was also a key member of the Leinster double winning season in 2017/18 playing 17 times and scoring three tries until a hamstring injury in the Heineken Champions Cup Semi-Final win over Scarlets – in the act of scoring a try – cut short his season.
For Ireland, McFadden was a member of the 2011 Rugby World Cup squad, scoring a try against Russia in the pool games, and he was also a member of the Ireland Six Nations winning squads in 2014 and 2018.
This season McFadden has scored two tries in six appearances for Leinster to date and given the current suspension of the rugby season, Cullen noted that McFadden may yet see action again, but wished his former team-mate the very best of luck when he does formally retire.
“We are being guided by public health guidelines at the moment but naturally the hope is that Fergus gets the chance to pull on the Leinster jersey again.
“Regardless of what happens though, we sincerely thank him for his efforts over the years and wish himself, Rebecca and their little boy Freddy the very best of luck.
“I’ve known Fergus a long time and his parents and my own parents would have agonised in the stands together as they watched their sons on the pitch so we wish all of them the very best of luck in the future and hopefully we will continue to keep those connections back to Leinster Rugby strong.”
Speaking to leinsterrugby.ie this morning, McFadden acknowledged all those had had played a part in his career to date, while also thanking the Leinster Rugby supporters.
“They say the best time to leave a party is when you’re still having fun so the time has come for me to announce my retirement from the end of the season. It’s hard to put into words what a privilege it has been to have had such a long career playing for the team I grew up supporting and pulling on a green jersey to play for my country. It has been a dream come true.
“So, reflecting on what made this all possible, I would like to thank all the Leinster Rugby staff, Leo Cullen, the wider management team, medics, physios, strength & conditioning coaches, backroom staff and our legendary bagman Johnny O’Hagan. Leinster’s incredible success over many years has been as a result of the contributions of the entire team both on and off the field.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'He's going to be a great loss' - Leo Cullen hails Fergus McFadden after decision to retire when season concludes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Leinster head coach Leo Cullen has paid a glowing tribute to Fergus McFadden after the veteran back confirmed that he will retire at the end of the season.
The 33-year old is facing the very real possibility that he has played his final game for his home province, as rugby continues to be put on hold due to Covid-19.
McFadden's contract will expire at the end of the season, and depending on what is decided over a potential return to play, he may not get the fitting farewell that his career would deserve.
The Kildare native will hang up his boots as a one-club man, having played 184 times for Leinster, as well as winning 34 Ireland caps across a successful 13-year career.

Cullen, who both played and coached McFadden throughout his time with Leinster, hailed his contribution on and off the pitch.
“Fergus has been an amazing contributor to lots of great things that have taken place in Leinster and Irish rugby and he’s definitely one of the great characters that we’ve had around in the group,” Cullen said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leinster and Ireland back Fergus McFadden to retire when the season ends</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">FERGUS MCFADDEN HAS announced that he will retire professional rugby once the 2019-20 season comes to a conclusion.
In addition to earning 34 caps for Ireland, the versatile 33-year-old back has made 184 appearances for Leinster since making his debut in September 2007.
“They say the best time to leave a party is when you’re still having fun so the time has come for me to announce my retirement from the end of the season,” McFadden said.
“It’s hard to put into words what a privilege it has been to have had such a long career playing for the team I grew up supporting and pulling on a green jersey to play for my country. It has been a dream come true.
“So, reflecting on what made this all possible, I would like to thank all the Leinster Rugby staff, Leo Cullen, the wider management team, medics, physios, strength and conditioning coaches, backroom staff and our legendary bagman Johnny O’Hagan. Leinster’s incredible success over many years has been as a result of the contributions of the entire team both on and off the field.
“To the players, there are too many for me to name individually right now but all I can say is that it has been an honour to play and work alongside such incredibly talented and professional people. The friendships and memories I have made are ones I will cherish for the rest of my life – not to mention the many laughs we had along the way!
“To the Leinster fan, I don’t think you could ask for better supporters. Your constant support and encouragement was felt throughout – not only there to celebrate the highs but also to support through the lows.
“To my wife Rebecca, my son Freddy, my parents, my friends and family, thanks for being there every step of the way.”
McFadden played in Leinster’s Heineken Cup final wins of both 2011 and ’12. He missed out on the victory in the 2018 decider after sustaining an injury while scoring a try in the semi-final win against Scarlets. The Kildare native also started in Leinster’s Pro12 final victories in 2013 and ’14.
Leinster head coach Leo Cullen paid tribute to the versatility of McFadden, who has scored 29 tries, 46 conversions and 68 penalties – as well as a drop goal against Cardiff in 2011 – during his time with the province.
“Fergus has been an amazing contributor to lots of great things that have taken place in Leinster and Irish rugby and he’s definitely one of the great characters that we’ve had around in the group,” said Cullen said.
“The versatility that Fergus has is hugely important. It can go against some players and tough calls not going their way but he would always do what’s best for the team. For example, even though typically your ten would take kicks, Fergus had no problem stepping up at crucial moments to take the pressure off someone. He had so many strings to his bow and he’s going to be a great loss to the group.”
At international level, McFadden made his debut against Italy in 2011 before going on to feature in the Ireland squads that won the Six Nations in 2014 and ’18. He also went to the 2011 World Cup, scoring a try in the defeat of Russia.
In spite of the uncertainty over the status of the 2019-20 season amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Cullen hopes that Leinster fans will get an opportunity to give McFadden a proper send-off.
He said: “We are being guided by public health guidelines at the moment but naturally the hope is that Fergus gets the chance to pull on the Leinster jersey again.
“Regardless of what happens though, we sincerely thank him for his efforts over the years and wish himself, Rebecca and their little boy Freddy the very best of luck.
“I’ve known Fergus a long time and his parents and my own parents would have agonised in the stands together as they watched their sons on the pitch, so we wish all of them the very best of luck in the future and hopefully we will continue to keep those connections back to Leinster Rugby strong.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leinster's Fergus McFadden to retire at the end of the season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fergus McFadden has confirmed that he will retire from rugby at the end of the current season.
Like fellow Ireland internationals Rob Kearney and Devin Toner, McFadden's contract is up this summer but Leinster may still extend the 33-year-old's stay if the club season gets up and running again in the coming months.
“They say the best time to leave a party is when you’re still having fun so the time has come for me to announce my retirement from the end of the season," said McFadden in a statement this afternoon. 
The Kildare man won four European titles with the province, as well as four PRO12/PRO14 titles and made 34 Test appearances for Ireland, with his international debut coming against Italy in the 2011 Six Nations championship.
His final Ireland appearance was off the bench in Paris and contributed as Johnny Sexton won it for the away team with the last kick of the game, the first step towards the Grand Slam in 2018. 
He was also part of the Six Nations winning squad of 2014, and previous to that went to the 2011 World Cup.
"It’s hard to put into words what a privilege it has been to have had such a long career playing for the team I grew up supporting and pulling on a green jersey to play for my country," said McFadden.  "It has been a dream come true.
“So, reflecting on what made this all possible, I would like to thank all the Leinster Rugby staff, Leo Cullen, the wider management team, medics, physios, strength & conditioning coaches, backroom staff and our legendary bagman Johnny O’Hagan. 
"Leinster's incredible success over many years has been as a result of the contributions of the entire team both on and off the field.
“To the players, there are too many for me to name individually right now but all I can say is that it has been an honour to play and work alongside such incredibly talented and professional people. The friendships and memories I have made are ones I will cherish for the rest of my life - not to mention the many laughs we had along the way!
“To the Leinster fans…I don’t think you could ask for better supporters. Your constant support and encouragement was felt throughout - not only there to celebrate the highs but also to support through the lows.
“To my wife Rebecca, my son Freddy, my parents, my friends and family, thanks for being there every step of the way.”  
Leinster head coach Leo Cullen expressed the hope that McFadden would get to say goodbye in the proper fashion.
“We are being guided by public health guidelines at the moment but naturally the hope is that Fergus gets the chance to pull on the Leinster jersey again," Cullen commented.
“Regardless of what happens though, we sincerely thank him for his efforts over the years and wish himself, Rebecca and their little boy Freddy the very best of luck.
“I’ve known Fergus a long time and his parents and my own parents would have agonised in the stands together as they watched their sons on the pitch.
"So we wish all of them the very best of luck in the future and hopefully we will continue to keep those connections back to Leinster Rugby strong.” 
Known for his full commitment and ability to play in the back three and at centre, McFadden played 184 times for Leinster and scored 29 tries - as well as kicking 46 conversions, 68 penalties....and a drop-goal against Cardiff nine years ago. He made his debut at centre in 2007, but was better known as a winger.
Cullen said: “Fergus has been an amazing contributor to lots of great things that have taken place in Leinster and Irish rugby and he’s definitely one of the great characters that we’ve had around in the group.
“The versatility piece that Fergus has is hugely important. It can go against some players and tough calls not going their way but he would always do what’s best for the team. 
"For example, even though typically your ten would take kicks, Fergus had no problem stepping up at crucial moments to take the pressure off someone. He had so many strings to his bow and he’s going to be a great loss to the group.”
Cullen was hugely impressed that, when McFadden was not selected for last year's World Cup, he answered the head coach's call to be a leader for Leinster.
"Fergus came out very high in that process and is still in that leadership group currently," he said.
“That leadership group is based off some questions that we would ask the wider playing group. What do they value? Who lives those values day in, day out? Who do they want in the dressing room sitting beside them?
“You always had a sense for how highly Fergus was regarded amongst his peers and this process just confirmed what we already thought".

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Leinster and Ireland player Fergus McFadden will retire when the 2019/20 rugby season concludes.
The 33-year-old first disclosed the decision in an interview with Peter O'Reilly in today's Sunday Times.
McFadden has made 184 appearances for Leinster to date along with winning 34 caps for Ireland.
"They say the best time to leave a party is when you’re still having fun so the time has come for me to announce my retirement from the end of the season," McFadden told the Leinster Rugby website.
"It’s hard to put into words what a privilege it has been to have had such a long career playing for the team I grew up supporting and pulling on a green jersey to play for my country. It has been a dream come true."
The Kildare man made his Leinster debut in 2007 while his international bow came four years later.
"Fergus has been an amazing contributor to lots of great things that have taken place in Leinster and Irish rugby and he’s definitely one of the great characters that we’ve had around in the group," said Leinster head coach Leo Cullen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United's Marcus Rashford can match Kylian Mbappe, says Matteo Darmian</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rashford has the potential to compete with Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappe for the Ballon d'Or in the near future, according to former Manchester United defender Matteo Darmian.
The 22-year-old is one of the success stories of the Red Devils' academy and has flourished into one of the Premier League's best forwards ever since bursting onto the scene in 2016.
Darmian, at United between 2015 and 2019, recalls how impressive the youngster was in his first training session at the club's Carrington base and predicts his former team-mate can reach the levels of World Cup winner Mbappe.
"I still remember Marcus Rashford's first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday," he told The Guardian. "I immediately thought: 'Wow, this is an incredible player'.
"He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me. If he continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d'Or winner. I'm convinced of this.
"He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he's very young and can still improve. For me he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappe and compete for the Ballon d'Or for years to come."
The 30-year-old left Old Trafford last summer and signed a four-year deal with Serie A side Parma, returning to his native Italy four years after departing for England, although he has plenty of sweet memories of his time in the Premier League.
Darmian was relegated to the bench ever since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took the reins in December 2019 but despite the lack of playing time he only has praise for the United boss and has backed him to steer the club back to glory days.
"I can only speak well about Solksjær, believe me," Darmian says. "I would give him a long-term contract.
"He's a very prepared coach and Manchester United has started this project, this journey, with many young players, many British players and they will continue with this project. Because of the person I got to know, I hope Solskjær has success at the club.
"I remember my first game for United being an incredible emotion. I felt like a child. Old Trafford is something fantastic, there's a reason that it's called the theatre of dreams.
"My debut was perfect because we beat Tottenham at home and I heard the fans screaming my name: a wonderful feeling. I felt a lot of pride but also the responsibility to play for one of the best clubs in the world."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United fans react to Marcus Rashford and Kylian Mbappe comparison</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Matteo Darmian claims that Marcus Rashford can reach the levels of Paris Saint-Germain ace Kylian Mbappe and challenge for the Ballon d'Or.
Rashford is United's top scorer this season, with 19 goals in all competitions before a back injury cut short his season prior to the postponement of the Premier League campaign.
Darmian left United in the summer transfer window to return to Italy with Parma but has fond memories of playing alongside Rashford.
"I still remember Marcus Rashford’s first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday," he told The Guardian. "I immediately thought: ‘wow, this is an incredible player’. He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me.
"If he continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d’Or winner. I’m convinced of this. He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he’s very young and can still improve. For me he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappé and compete for the Ballon d’Or for years to come."
Some United fans believe Rashford has already reached the same level of Mbappe as he has proved his ability in a much tougher league.
United great Rio Ferdinand recently pinpointed Rashford as a player United should look to build around in the coming years and referenced Mbappe in his argument.
"Rashford can be up there with the best 100 per cent, because he's got mad talent," Ferdinand told The Beautiful Game podcast.
"From a kid, I've seen him play, whether it was up front or wide, or drifting about, he's always had mad talent and Man United have always known. It's whether you can translate that to being in the first-team and he's shown he can do that. He's just been unfortunate he's been in a team that's been in transition ever since he's been in the first-team.
"It's very different to, say, Mbappe coming into a Paris Saint-Germain team that's going to win it every year, fighting for trophies on all fronts, the confidence levels are there, there's no finding out period with any of the players there. They're a consistent, well-oiled machine in their league and that league's not as hard either, but Mbappe's major.
"It seems like Ole was getting the consistency in the squad and that was when [Rashford] wasn't playing, which was the disappointing part. So fingers crossed, if he can get back to normal he can get back to some consistency and they can start trying to get back to the heights of where Man United were at before. And then I think we'll see more from Marcus, because if I'm Man United I'm building it all around him."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unai Emery, the former Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain coach, has named Brazilian football star Neymar as the likely successor to Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.
In an interview with Spanish newspaper Marca, Emery said that Neymar has all the chances to become the world's best player. 
The 28-year-old Neymar won seven titles with Barcelona before his transfer to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017, where he won three Ligue 1 titles while the club was coached by Emery. 
Lionel Messi is an Argentine forward who plays and captains both Spanish club Barcelona and his home country's national team.
Cristiano Ronaldo is a Portuguese footballer who is a forward for Serie A club Juventus and captain of Portugal's national team.
The two football stars have won 11 of the last 12 Ballon d'Or awards between them.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ex-Man United ace thinks Rashford can win Ballon d’Or and ‘reach’ Mbappe’s level</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Manchester United defender Matteo Darmian has told the Guardian in an interview that Marcus Rashford is capable of being a ‘Ballon d’Or winner’ and that he can ‘reach’ Kylian Mbappe’s level.
Darmian told the Guardian that he ‘immediately thought’ that Rashford was an ‘incredible player’ after seeing the forward’s first training session with the first-team a few years ago.
The full-back, who left the Red Devils last summer, added that he’s ‘convinced’ that Rashford can win the Ballon d’Or in his career and added that the lightning-fast star ‘impressed him the most’ during his time at Old Trafford.
Rashford has been sensational for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side this season, the ace has flourished in a centre-forward role after a fairly difficult start to the season.

Here’s what Darmian had to say on the England international:
“I still remember Marcus Rashford’s first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday. I immediately thought: ‘wow, this is an incredible player’.”
“He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me.”
“If he continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d’Or winner. I’m convinced of this.”
“He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he’s very young and can still improve. For me he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappe and compete for the Ballon d’Or for years to come.”
Unfortunately, Rashford’s best season to date was hindered after he suffered a long-term injury in a FA Cup clash against Wolves in January.
The Sun now report that the 22-year-old is nearing a return to full fitness, with it being claimed that the star will be ready once the Premier League returns after the UK hopefully make some progress in dealing with the Coronavirus pandemic.
Rashford has bagged 19 goals and five assists in 31 appearances across all competitions this season.
United perhaps would’ve been heavily hit by Rashford’s absence if it wasn’t for January signing Bruno Fernandes hitting the ground running and Anthony Martial’s uplift in form.
Loanee Odion Ighalo has also turned in some fine performances for the boyhood club, all in all, once Rashford returns, the Red Devils should have the in-form attack needed to secure Champions League qualification – should the Premier League season resume.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Erling Haaland makes transfer prediction as he puts Liverpool on alert with Virgil van Dijk review</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Erling Haaland has lavished praise upon Virgil van Dijk as he named the Liverpool standout the best player he has ever faced.
The 19-year-old striker is the biggest rising star in European football after netting 12 goals in 11 games for Borussia Dortmund after his January move from Salzburg.
It comes after the Leeds-born Norway international was strongly linked with a move to Manchester United before he decided to continue his development in Germany.
And Haaland admits the Liverpool star - who he faced in the Champions League while at Salzburg - is the cream of the crop defensively.
He said: "He is so good. He is powerful, quick, he possesses all the qualities. He is an incredible player."
And the strike sensation broached his own future as addressed what his plan is for the rest of his career.
He added: "I have just arrived. I am very happy here. I want to achieve many things.
"I am only concentrating on that. The stadium here gives me goose bumps, and I feel well here."
But Jessie Marsch. his former boss at Salzburg, believes Haaland's iron-clad mental make-up is what separates him from other rising stars around the world.
He said: "What makes Erling so special is his mentality.
"To start with, he was in the youth World Cup, he scored 9 goals in one game. We gave every one of our players who had international obligations three weeks off before they were supposed to come with us. Erling had six days off and then said 'no, I want to come to camp'.
"Erling came to Salzburg last winter, he played one game in spring, so he had a lot of sitting on the bench. He was so keen to start proving himself, right away I knew this kid had ambition and grind.
"He's fearless, he's competitive, he's got a drive to get better, he's equiped with so many qualities that make him very different and special, along with the ability and pure talent, he'll be fun to watch in the coming years, that's for sure."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Having featured for both Juventus and Manchester United, we take a look at Paul Pogba's ultimate teammate XI that only includes three Red Devils stars.
Tired of reading? Click through the gallery to see Pogba's Ultimate Teammate XI.
Pogba began his professional career with the Red Devils after making his debut in 2010 in a League Cup fixture, however after not getting enough game time he left for Juventus on a free transfer in 2011.
Pogba established himself as one of Europe's prominent midfielders during his time with Juventus, where he made 173 appearances while winning four Serie A titles.
So it is no surprise that the ultimate XI is dominated by Juventus players, starting with Gianluigi Buffon in goals who made 156 appearances alongside the Frenchman.
The defence is made up of Stephan Lichtsteiner, Leonardo Bonucci, Giorgio Chiellini and former United and Juventus defender Patrice Evra, who also played with Pogba for the French national side.
It's more of the same in the midfield with regards to Juventus players, but United's Jesse Lingard also features after making 116 appearances alongside Pogba at Old Trafford.
The attack is completed by two current Red Devils stars in Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, with both players playing over 100 games each with the 2018 World Cup winner.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wayne Rooney: 'Ravel Morrison was better than Paul Pogba'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While Pogba has progressed into one of the biggest stars in world football, Morrison has failed to make the transition into the professional ranks, already accumulating 11 clubs by the age of 27.
However, Rooney has claimed that the playmaker possessed more ability than the likes of Pogba and Jesse Lingard when they were attempting to break into the United first team.
Speaking to The Times, Rooney said: "I remember watching Ravel Morrison thinking he had everything required for a player in his position. He nutmegged Nemanja Vidic three times in the space of a minute in one training game.
"But he struggled with lifestyle and his environment which was sad for him - because I saw Paul Pogba come through, Jesse Lingard, all these players and Ravel was better than any of them by a country mile.
"He's proof that you can't escape the fact there are guidelines every player has to obey in professional football."
Morrison made just three substitute appearances for United, all of which came in the EFL Cup.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dimitar Berbatov: 'Lazy? No, I was smart', says ex-Tottenham & Man Utd striker</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dimitar Berbatov was often viewed as lazy during his time playing in England. What his critics didn't know was that this was all a part of the striker's plan.
In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, the former Tottenham and Manchester United forward revealed that his languid playing style was in fact a ploy to lull defenders into a false sense of security.
With 94 goals in 229 Premier League games, it would be fair to say that it often worked.
During his conversation with former team-mate Jermaine Jenas, who described the Bulgarian as "one of the best players I’ve played with", Berbatov also touched on his time at Bayer Leverkusen, Tottenham and Manchester United, why Harry Kane could have a similar transfer dilemma to the one he faced, and his potential plans to move into coaching.
He was known for his technical ability and composure, but not for his bustling physical style - qualities that often led to people suggesting he did not work hard enough...
Everybody is different in the way they see the game and play. My difference was that sometimes you would see I might not be into the game, but at the same time I was scanning the pitch to see where to position myself at the right moment, at the right time in a pocket of space - and you can give me the ball so that I have more time to myself and not have someone on my back.
When I have that time and space I have more time to think about where to put the ball.
Some people don't understand it, but if you are clever in your head, even if you are slow in speed, you can still be quick. You can position yourself better and be even more use to your team.
If you were to put it into order of the players who would run in my Tottenham team I would say Jermaine, [Robbie] Keane and then probably everybody else - with me behind.
But I was running in my head. And when I see someone in a better position than me I always give the ball. No selfishness. In the end we win and lose together.
It seems a bit strange, but in every team I have been in, you see my style of play and sometimes fans and players don't understand that and they become a bit afraid of it, like I am not helping and not good for the team.
But after a while you get used to it because this style can bring results.
He made the move to Tottenham from Bayer Levekusen in the summer of 2006 for a fee of £10.9m...
When you are a young boy, you think you know everything, so I am expecting big teams like Barcelona or Real Madrid to come after me. My agent says to me: 'Well, none of these teams are coming after you at the moment so cool down.'
He tells me Spurs want me. Honestly, I did not know a lot about the Premier League and Spurs then because I was concentrating in my own world in Germany. I started following Spurs to see how good they are. And my agent tells me, this is the time now to leave and join them.
I needed to adjust myself for the speed of the Premier League, and the physicality of it. I saw players I had never seen in the Bundesliga - like body builders - and I was thinking: 'What is going on?' I knew I needed to use my brain even more. It was a challenge.
I needed a few months to feel ready and for my team-mates to accept me. I was a bit shy, not talking too much.
My relationship with [strike partner] Keano... we didn't speak much. I can't really explain, but our understanding on the pitch just clicked.
His move to Old Trafford was a controversial one, coming very late on deadline day in September 2008, although the fee of £30.75m did net Spurs a tidy profit...
I am coming from a small country, from Bulgaria. I am hoping to play my whole career in England with just one team, but it is not the case.
Spurs gave me the opportunity to show what I can do; the final step on my mountain of success was United.
When they came I knew I would make people disappointed, especially the Spurs fans. But I was following my own path and I knew that if I missed that chance another will not come like that. This is how it is in football.
Everybody was so welcoming, and even if you don't speak much you can still learn. They had players that had been champions and won the treble and I was like: 'Berbs, I have finally made it.' This is what I had worked to all my life.
I was happy, but I was thinking: 'What am I doing here?' Like a kid. This can sometimes stop you showing what you can really do.
Sir Alex [Ferguson, then United manager] was great to everybody. He knew how to stick with everybody individually - some you have to be gentle with, some tough with. He knew how to do that.
Even he never told me that I needed to change. This was a good thing. He trusted me in his own way.
The success of current Spurs striker Kane means he has been linked with moves away from the club, and Berbatov feels the situation is very similar to his back in 2008...
Because it has been established a long time ago which the big clubs are, you will always have that situation with teams like Spurs - where their best players have to decide if they stay here or move to a big club.
It is exactly the same with Harry Kane at the moment. He is going to be at a crossroad, thinking: 'What do I do now?'
The situation is maybe difficult now because of coronavirus and the money, but he is in exactly the same situation I was in. In his head sometimes he is maybe not in the right place.
My head was not in the right place at times. How could it be? I didn't want to put my team in a position where I go late in the window and leave them without a replacement. But it will happen after me many times, with many players.
The most painful part is that Spurs' last trophy was when me and Jermaine were there. It will be stated over and over again and make people angry that the lack of trophies is the main problem for players like Kane, who is captain of England and not getting younger.
But when he gets older, he wants to say to his kids: 'Look what I won.'
He retired last year following spells with Fulham, Monaco, POAK and Kerala Blasters in India, and now, aged 39, is considering his next career move...
It is not going to be easy. All football players think we are going to be great coaches, which is of course far from the truth.
I have my A licence already and am going to go for my pro licence later this year hopefully.
You never know. I would at least like to be prepared for the future, whatever that may be. If that is as a coach, I know I will be prepared.
At the moment, though, I am spending more time with my kids and family.

    <h5 class="mb-1">"Being alongside Zlatan is a blessing"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Theo Hernández, one of AC Milan's best players this campaign, spoke about his season at Milan to 'La Gazzetta dello Sport'.
AC Milanhave not been as consistent as they would like this season, but they have been some positive signs.
One of them, the former Real Madrid player Theo Hernandez, is unanimously considered to be one of Serie A's best players this season. 
The Frenchman spoke about this term so far to 'La Gazzetta dello Sport': "It has been a very important year for me. I have adapted very quickly to a new league and the pressure of being at a big club."
Theo praised Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who said it was "a blessing" to be able to share a team with him. "Being in contact with Zlatan is a blessing, an opportunity to improve together with one of the best players in the world," he explained.
Main links
The former Real Madrid player admitted his great adaptation to the club, the city and the culture and tried to analyse his future. "I'm still very young and I have room to grow. We will see what the future brings," he said in relation to a possible change in position. That is what Gareth Bale did as he began as a full back.
The French defender denied he was a main man for AC Milan because "I still need to play lots of games to become it" and he seemed willing to fight for a place in the France national team at Euro 2021.
To conclude, he supported Pioli, his under fire coach, and admitted he was a great admirer of Paolo Maldini: "He has always been a role model for me. I'm happy he and his son Daniel have recovered."

The Brazilian is currently the world's most expensive footballer following his move from Barcelona to PSG in the summer of 2017.
Both Messi and Ronaldo are already slowing down having stayed on top of their games well over one and a half-decade.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi's successor named by Unai Emery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unai Emery has identified the star who will "take over" from Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the world's best player.
Messi and Ronaldo have dominated European football for over a decade, winning 11 of the last 12 Ballon d'Or awards between them.
But the duo's time at top of the game is slowly coming to an end and Emery has identified a player he previously coached as the heir to the title of best in the world.
The Spaniard has managed at Sevilla and Arsenal, where he was sacked last November after a poor run of form, but the player he has named as Messi and Ronaldo's successor comes from his time as Paris Saint-Germain boss.
And that star is Brazil icon Neymar, who worked with Emery at Parc des Princes after joining PSG from Barcelona in a world-record £198m transfer in 2017.
Emery discussed his "magnificent" season in charge of Neymar and insists that the forward has the ability to become the best player in the world.
"The year I was with him [Neymar] was magnificent," Emery told Spanish newspaper Marca. "I learned a lot from seeing his answers in each training session and in the matches.

"Neymar has football inside, but also the faculties and the conditions to execute it. I think he is facing the opportunity to take over from Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo to be the best player in the world, and he has time to do it."
Neymar is seven years younger than Ronaldo and four years younger than Messi at 28 years old and has enjoyed a glittering career so far.
He won seven titles with Barcelona before moving to France and has won three Ligue 1 titles in a row after it was announced that PSG would be awarded this season's title despite the campaign being cancelled in the week.
During their season together, Emery and Neymar won the domestic treble but the Spaniard left his role at the end of the campaign.

Former Manchester United star Mikael Silvestre has insisted that Cristiano Ronaldo should never be compared to Brazilian legend Ronaldo de Lima.

Silvestre was Cristiano's teammate at Old Trafford while he played with the former Barcelona and Inter Milan star at the national team level.
He claimed the Portuguese star has just about three of four tricks he uses most of the times but with De Lima, it was a new style at every given chance.

“He was inventing things on the spot, so you can’t guide him left or right because he’s going to get out of these situations, no matter what.
"He could score from any type of position. He was playing on one leg at some points and was still beating defenders all over Europe."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unai Emery believes Neymar has the capacity to usurp Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the best player in the world.
Former Paris Saint-Germain head coach Emery worked with Neymar for his first season in France after the Brazil international's €222million move from Barcelona in 2017.
The Spaniard, who left PSG in 2018 and went on to manage Arsenal, loved his experience with Neymar and continues to believe in the 28-year-old's world-class ability.
"I had a magnificent year with him," Emery said, per EFE, in an interview with Granada coach Diego Martinez, who was his assistant at Sevilla.

Neymar has won six trophies in his three seasons at PSG, including a Ligue 1 title in each year.
Champions League success has so far eluded him in France, though PSG had secured a quarter-final place in this season's competition before the coronavirus pandemic brought a halt to major football.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Neymar ready to usurp Messi and Ronaldo: Emery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Neymar has time on his side as he looks to become the best player in world football, says his former coach Unai Emery.
Unai Emery believes Neymarhas the capacity to usurp Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the best player in the world.
Former Paris Saint-Germain head coach Emery worked with Neymar for his first season in France after the Brazil international's €222million move from Barcelona in 2017. The Spaniard, who left PSG in 2018 and went on to manage Arsenal, loved his experience with Neymar and continues to believe in the 28-year-old's world-class ability.

"I had a magnificent year with him," Emery said, per EFE, in an interview with Granada coach Diego Martinez, who was his assistant at Sevilla. "I learned so much watching his responses in each training session and in games. Neymar has the talent inside him but also the ability and qualities to execute it.
"I think he's got an opportunity to take the baton from Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and be the best player in the world, and he has the time to do it."
Neymar has won six trophies in his three seasons at PSG, including a Ligue 1 title in each year. Champions League success has so far eluded him in France, though PSG had secured a quarter-final place in this season's competition before the coronavirus pandemic brought a halt to major football.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Unai Emery reveals who will 'take over' from Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brazil superstar Neymar has been backed to ‘take over’ from Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi as the best player in the world by former Arsenal and PSG manager Unai Emery.
Neymar started his career at Brazilian club Santos before moving to Barcelona in 2013 and winning two La Liga titles and the Champions League at the Nou Camp.
The forward made a surprising move to PSG three years ago and has continued to impress in the French capital, scoring 69 goals in 80 matches and winning three successive league titles.
Emery insists it was ‘magnificent’ working with Neymar while he was in charge of PSG and says the Brazilian can take over from Ronaldo and Messi as the best player on the planet.
Ronaldo and Messi are two of the best players in the history of the game and have won 11 of the last 12 Ballon d’Or awards.
‘The year I was with him [Neymar] was magnificent,’ former Arsenal and PSG manager Emery told Marca.
‘I learned a lot from seeing his answers in each training session and in the matches.
‘Neymar has football inside, but also the faculties and the conditions to execute it.
‘I think he is facing the opportunity to take over from Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo to be the best player in the world, and he has time to do it.’
Emery won a number of trophies at PSG but struggled at Premier League club Arsenal and was sacked after just 16 months in charge. The Spaniard has been out of work since his axing in November 2019.
On Thursday, Neymar’s PSG were awarded the Ligue 1 title after it was announced the season would not resume because of the coronavirus pandemic.
PSG were 12 points clear at the top of the table when French football was suspended indefinitely on March 13.
The club said in a statement that they wished to dedicate the title ‘to healthcare staff and all the everyday heroes on the front line’.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Club owners optimistic about Fox Sports' A-League appetite</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A-League club owners are hopeful the competition's long-term relationship with Fox Sports can be salvaged, with arrangements for the resumption of the season set to progress this week.
As revealed by the Herald, Football Federation Australia has belatedly received the near $12 million quarterly payment from Fox that was due last month after tense discussions led by chief executive James Johnson.
The money enables planning for the final rounds of the A-League season to move ahead, with FFA and the clubs waiting on Friday's national cabinet meeting before finalising the specifics of when, where and how matches will be played.
Perth Glory chairman Tony Sage said his fellow club owners were "very happy" that Fox had paid FFA and was optimistic that the three seasons left on the A-League's broadcast deal would be honoured.
That Fox has not yet walked away from football, despite having had the opportunity to do so, was a positive sign, Sage said.
"To be fair to Fox, they've had a lot on their plate," Sage told the Herald.
"They're in massive negotiations with their two big sports - as a football person I don't like saying it, but it's true, AFL and NRL, they're big sports for them. They've had a lot to deal with and maybe the A-League just got shunted down the pile a little bit, which is frustrating, but understandable.
"Hopefully they want to continue on. I would have expected if they didn't pay they wouldn't continue but the fact that they've paid, it may be the same as with the AFL and NRL and they just want to renegotiate."
Sage also hailed Johnson's performance as FFA chief, giving him "full marks" for the job he's done since starting in January, just weeks before the COVID-19 epidemic tipped the sporting industry on its head.
Industry sources suggest Fox has been equally impressed by Johnson's handling of such a difficult and uncertain situation, and for treating the company's 15-year partnership with the A-League with respect.
"I give him full marks for what he's done," Sage said. "Patience, conservatism is what we've needed. Like [AFL chief executive] Gillon McLachlan, he didn't go out like a bull at a gate and maybe inflame situations. We're very lucky that the FFA managed to nab him."
Sage said A-League clubs were expecting to return to training on or around July 1, with no games likely to be played until August.
That would give FFA enough time to strike a long-term resolution with Fox, and to also negotiate with Professional Footballers Australia over pay cuts for players and for the short-term extension of contracts beyond May 31.
"The PFA have been, other than that one I letter I got very early, very good," said Sage, who drew the union's ire by becoming the first A-League owner to stand down their squad. "They've been very patient, waiting for number one, the Fox payment to be made ... but we won't be generating any more revenue for those games, it will just be a cost."
A-League owners will also meet this week to discuss next steps, with clubs likely to receive smaller distributions from FFA because of steep declines in revenue across the board in football.
Sage said FFA had not yet discussed resumption plans with the clubs, but he was anticipating the 'hub model' being contemplated by the AFL and NRL was highly likely for the A-League.
"It makes sense to me that it's all in one location so that the health and safety of the players can be controlled," Sage said.
"There was a plan already put in place by the FFA before this happened - we were going to play it out until everything went pear-shaped. I presume they'll just dust off that plan, and that plan was for the clubs to go to NSW."
Meanwhile, Sage laughed off reports from abroad that put forward Perth as a possible location for the English Premier League season to be completed.
The Sun newspaper claimed Gary Williams, an English agent based in Perth, had received support from some Premier League clubs and government officials for the ambitious proposal.
"Seriously, if anyone has any sort of belief that that is even in the realms of consideration ... it's just ridiculous," Sage said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 23-year-old became Tottenham's club-record signing last summer when he arrived from Lyon.
The midfielder has found it difficult to make his mark in the English capital, though, contributing just two goals and two assists in 19 Premier League appearances.
Barca have been strongly linked with Ndombele over the last couple of weeks, but according to The Telegraph, the France international is not interested in a summer move.
The report claims that he is determined to 'prove himself' with Jose Mourinho's side and does not want to 'leave the club as a flop'.
Ndombele's contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium still has more than five years left to run.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Frank Lampard’s comments on key Chelsea star amid transfer rumours</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has made a statement on star midfielder N’Golo Kante amid transfer speculation surrounding the French international, according to a report in the Mirror.
According to the report, it looks certain that Kante will remain at Chelsea given Blues boss Lampard’s latest comments about the star midfielder.
Kante has established himself as one of the best defensive midfielders in world football after his move from Leicester to Chelsea, winning the Premier League with both clubs in successive seasons in 2015/16 and 2016/17.
He also won the FA Cup and Europa League with Chelsea since his move from Leicester.
The French midfielder has been linked to Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain in recent months but it now looks as though Kante is firmly in Lampard’s plans going forward if the Chelsea manager’s latest comments are to be believed.
Speaking about Kante to BT Sport as cited in the Mirror, Lampard said:
“We had four or five of those (injured players) when we finished playing recently,”
“N’Golo Kante is obviously a great example because he’s played four or five incredible seasons in terms of his individual success and he’s been used quite rightly by his managers a lot.”
“This season he’s played only about 40% of our games and even then it’s been difficult for him and I’ve really felt for him on an individual level. He’s been a huge miss for us.”
“Looking forward, whenever a restart comes we want to get him in the best shape, want to get Ruben Loftus-Cheek in the best shape.”
“We’ve had slightly different plans for them but they’ve been scuppered with what we’ve had to do. The players’ health comes first, the mental well-being of the players comes first.”
“We obviously need N’Golo Kante back in our team, one of the best players in the world. I knew that before I became manager of Chelsea and know that now from working with him.”
“I haven’t been able to have him much this year and going forward we, of course, want him fit and raring to go.”
The French world cup winning midfielder has three years left on his contract at Chelsea and looks likely to remain at the club until his contract expires as the Blues have no plans of selling the player.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RB Leipzig chief hints at summer exit for Arsenal and Man Utd target Upamecano</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The transfer market may be hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic this summer, but one big move that still looks likely is Dayot Upamecano leaving RB Leipzig, as the club’s managing director hints that he will be sold.
The 21-year-old defender’s contract expires next year, and Oliver Mintzlaff has ruled out the possibility of him being allowed to leave for free.
With a new contract unlikely, that seems to suggest Upamecano will be on the move this summer as Leipzig look to cash in on one of the most impressive defensive talents in Europe.
Arsenal and Manchester United have both been credited with an interest in Upamecano, as have Tottenham and Bayern Munich, so there is set to be quite the tussle for his services as and when the transfer window reopens. A battle that has been fuelled by Mintzlaff’s comments.
‘In the Covid-19 crisis, we have other issues greater than concerns about contracts,’ Mintzlaff told Sport1.
‘We know the terms of our players’ contracts and I know them very well – especially that of our top performers.
‘For us, it is a no go that the top performers will be allowed to leave our club free of charge. That’s the case with Timo Werner and that will be the case with Dayot Upamecano. I have the economic stability of the club in mind.’
A fee of around £55m has been touted for Upamecano, but with the economic uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic, clubs will be less willing to pay big sums this summer.
Leipzig may have also left themselves in a tricky situation with his contract running out and admitting they have to sell.
Timo Werner is also being heavily linked with a move away from Leipzig this summer, with Liverpool interested in him, but his contract runs until 2023, so there is less pressure to sell in the near future.
However, the German does have a £50m release clause, which could well be triggered by potential suitors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coutinho reportedly too expensive for Leicester after LFC turn down chance to re-sign Brazilian</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Barcelona are actively searching for a new club for Philippe Coutinho, but Leicester City have been priced out of any deal for the attacking midfielder.
That’s according to the Leicester Mercury, who claim that the Foxes would not be able to afford the Brazilian and suggest it’s lazy to link him to the East Midlands outfit.
Manager Brendan Rodgers worked with Coutinho at Liverpool during his tenure at Anfield and helped turn him into the world-class talent he’s become.
A move to work under the Northern Irishman could be seen as an attempt to get his faltering career back on track.
Earlier this week, we revealed that Liverpool have turned down the chance to re-sign Coutinho from Barcelona, as there was an attempt from the Brazilian’s camp to get him back to Anfield.
The ‘little magician’ was said to be desperate to return, after his dream move to Barcelona – and failed move to Germany – didn’t turn out to be all it was cracked up to be.
There is no doubt the midfielder still possesses his talent – he’s just been unable to get his shine back since departing Anfield – but a return to Liverpool is extremely unrealistic.
The price tag required to re-sign Coutinho would be gargantuan, and for a player we simply don’t need anymore, it likely wouldn’t be worth it.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Willian has failed to secure a contract extension at Chelsea
- The Brazilian will become a free agent once this season is over
- Willian has hinted a re-uniting with Mourinho at Tottenham this summer
Chelsea winger Willian might be considering a move to join Tottenham Hotspur this summer after revealing that he and Spurs boss Jose Mourinho are friends.
The Brazilian winger will become a free agent this summer following the Blues' failure giving him an extension at Stamford Bridge.
Willian who has also been linked with a move to Barcelona and Paris Saint Germain admitted that he regularly speaks with the Portuguese born tactician.

According to SunSport, the 31-year-old forward was said to have demanded a new three-year extension but the London club is not ready to tie him down for that long.

Willian who has been out of action since the middle of March due to the outbreak of coronavirus found time to grant an interview while on lockdown.
The Blues' captain said on a Bolivia Talk Show: "Nothing arrived from Mourinho but we do have a good relationship, he’s a big friend of mine.
"We speak to each other sometimes but when it comes to that (speaking about transfers) he respects me a lot."
The attacker who joined Chelsea from Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala in a deal valued around £32 million seven years ago added that his family is comfortable in the English capital.
Answering questions about what the future holds, he said: "I like London and my family likes it too but that’s a question I don’t know how to answer.

Since his arrival at Stamford Bridge seven years ago, Willian has won two Premier Leagues, one FA Cup, one EFL Cup as well as one Europa League title.
Legit.ng earlier reported that Chelsea winger Willian could be on his way to Premier League rivals Arsenal after being reportedly offered to the Gunners by his agent Kia Joorabchian.
Super agent Kia Joorabchian feels Willian will be an excellent replacement for Gabonese striker Aubameyang who could move away from the Emirates stadium at the end of the season.
The Gabonese forward is entering the final year of his contract at Arsenal, and the striker has not agreed any new deal with the North London side.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cricket News
Written By Press Trust Of India | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 08:09 IST
Sri Lankan batting great Mahela Jayawardene says there is "nothing harmful" in having players with big egos in a team as long as he is able to get the best out of them within an ideal environment. Jayawardene has achieved considerable success in leadership roles in recent years, first as a captain and then coach, and said he has always backed his players to the hilt. Helming the affairs in a team-game like cricket, Jayawardene was asked how does he deal with big egos. 
The 42-year-old is one of Sri Lanka's most successful captains. Speaking further on handling players with big egos, he said, "It's about treating everyone professionally, and about treating everyone with respect. It is a team culture that you create.  "Once you create that culture, it's hard for an individual to go beyond that.  "The rest of the players will bring that person down to the group level. If you haven't created that team environment, then you can have a problem because there are no boundaries and people drift."
Under his guidance, Mumbai Indians have won two titles in the last three editions of IPL.  He said experience is one of things that has helped Mumbai Indians thrive during his time. "We try to make everybody involved in the processes. The thing with Mumbai is that a lot of guys have a lot of experience. There are very few young guys - about three or four - but those guys also have played a lot of first-class cricket and are mature players.  "So you try and encourage everyone to contribute. It's always good for the captain to get ideas, and at the end of the day it's he who has to make the call, but the more ideas he gets (from others), it influences his thought process."

First as a captain and then coach, Jayawardene is known to back his players to the hilt and feels there is ‘nothing harmful’ in having players with big egos in a team as long as he is able to get the best out of them within an ideal environment.

Under Jayawardene’s guidance, popular IPL franchise Mumbai Indians have won two titles in the last three editions of the T20 slugfest. He said experience is one of the things that has helped Mumbai Indians thrive during his time.

“We try to make everybody involved in the processes. The thing with Mumbai is that a lot of guys have a lot of experience. There are very few young guys – about three or four – but those guys also have played a lot of first-class cricket and are mature players,” Jayawardene was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo.

“So you try and encourage everyone to contribute. It’s always good for the captain to get ideas, and at the end of the day it’s he who has to make the call, but the more ideas he gets (from others), it influences his thought process.”
Helming the affairs in a team-game like cricket, the 42-year-old veteran was asked how does he deal with big egos. “It’s good to have that. It’s nothing harmful. It’s about identifying and making sure that they thrive. Everyone has got to this level because they are good, right? So you try and get them to prove that. That’s all you need to do.”
Jayawardene is one of Sri Lanka’s most successful captains. Speaking further on handling players with big egos, he said, “It’s about treating everyone professionally, and about treating everyone with respect. It is a team culture that you create.
“Once you create that culture, it’s hard for an individual to go beyond that.
“The rest of the players will bring that person down to the group level. If you haven’t created that team environment, then you can have a problem because there are no boundaries, and people drift.”
When asked if he has ever felt in any of his leadership roles the absence of control over the dressing room, he responded in the negative. “It hasn’t happened. I’m very honest with whatever I do. We can have brutally honest conversations. Nothing is personal with me.
“You just need to cultivate that mutual respect. If the transparency is there and there are no agendas, the players understand that.
“I also back the players to the hilt, whether as a captain or a coach. I’m always on the players’ side,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">After Injury And Eye Surgeries, Reena Eyes Olympics Selection</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hockey news
Written By Press Trust Of India | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 07:53 IST
A gym session gone awry has threatened to end her career but after two eye surgeries and months away from the game, mid-fielder Reena is looking at selection in Indian women's hockey team for the Tokyo Olympics. Reena, who was a regular feature in the Indian squad since her debut in 2017, fought her way through the challenging times with strong will and a tremendous support system. "I was using a stretch-band to do some simple flexibility exercise when the band snapped and hit my left eye. It happened so quickly that I had no time to react. At that time, little did I know that the next four months would be the worse phase of my life," recalled Reena.
To the surprise of many, Reena was available for FIH Olympic Qualifiers selections, having made her comeback in the Test Event in Tokyo in August 2019. She went through another corrective surgery in December, but the danger had passed by then. "I got a break in the Indian team quite late. I was around 24 when I made my India debut and my junior India experience is less, so the next one year I will do everything I can do prove myself worthy of a place in the Olympic-bound India squad," she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Career-threatening eye injury failed to dent Reena Khokar's spirit to play for Indian hockey team</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BENGALURU: Indian women's team midfielder Reena Khokar had a mishap during a gym session in April last year that could have ended her career but her will to fight the uncertainty made it possible for her to wear the India jersey again.
"I was using a stretch-band to do some simple flexibility exercise when the band snapped and hit my left eye. It happened so quickly that I had no time to react. At that time, little did I know that the next four months would be the worse phase of my life," said Reena, who made her India debut against New Zealand in 2017.
The player possesses exceptional defensive skills, was a regular feature in the Indian squad since she made her debut in 2017. She was part of the team that won the silver medal at the 2018 Asian Games and also played the FIH Women's World Cup earlier that year.
Her progress in the team was steadfast until the mishap in 2019 which cast doubt on whether she can be ready for the all-important Olympic Qualifier later that year.

"Initially the doctor had said it will heal soon but even after a month when the pain was persistent, the doctor then advised surgery to rule out permanent damage to the retina. This news was devastating and all I could think of was whether I will ever play hockey again," stated the 26-year-old from Chandigarh.
After a brief break, Reena returned to the national camp in July.
"I was advised two months bed rest and when I returned to the camp chief coach Sjoerd would talk to me regularly to pep me up. He would tell me about a player in Netherlands who played hockey with vision only in one eye. Positive stories like these and emotional support from my parents and some close friends outside of hockey kept me motivated. When I held the stick again, after almost three months, I knew I would do anything to return to the team and I am thankful to the coaching staff who supported me with step-by-step return to full training and didn't put any kind of pressure," she expressed.
To the surprise of many, Reena was available for FIH Olympic Qualifiers selections as she had made her comeback in the Test Event held in Tokyo in August 2019 where India was victorious. Though in December, she went through another corrective surgery, the danger had passed and Reena now vies to make best use of this year to earn a place in the Tokyo-bound Indian side.
"I got a break in the Indian team quite late. I was around 24 when I made my India debut and my junior India experience is less, so the next one year I will do everything I can do prove myself worthy of a place in the Olympic-bound India squad," Reena said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Patrice Evra explains why best moment at Man Utd was worst day of his career</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Patrice Evra has claimed his best moment at Manchester United was the worst day of his career – his car-crash debut against derby rivals City.
The French defender went on to win five Premier League titles and the Champions League for United.
But he suffered an ignominious start to life at Old Trafford, with a 3-1 defeat by City in January 2006 coming just days after his £5.5million signing from Monaco.
Now the Frenchman has, surprisingly, declared that to be the game he'd most like to relive.
“It would be my first game! People ask me, ‘What's your best moment?’ And they expect me to say something else.
“But I will say the derby, the first game, because everything was new, I receive a big slap on my face.
“I thought I was a big player! My agent didn't believe in me and Ferguson gave me the hairdryer!
“I thought: 'What the hell am I doing here?' I was in Monte-Carlo chilling, here the football is so fast.
“'Oh my God you’re so done Patrice. You should go back to Monte-Carlo’. I remember thinking that and the worst part is when the game was finished.
“We go back to my flat with my agent and his wife and my agent looked at me like this and said, ‘Patrice, I’m sorry’.
“I was like, ‘Why?’ ‘I’m sorry to bring you here. You’ll never make it, it’s too hard, you should have stayed in Monte-Carlo’. In front of his wife!
“That day I was so bad, so embarrassing. My agent actually telling me I should have never gone to Manchester United. So yeah, I have this tough moment, but it helped me to become who I am.
“It just made me realise, ‘Hey, you will have to work really hard here if you want to be a United player’.
“So that's the moment that I would want to relive, because it was a hard moment, but such a positive moment.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">“You’ll never make it” – Man United legend reveals agent initially told him Old Trafford move was a mistake</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United legend Patrice Evra admits he got off to a nightmare start at the club when he first joined from Monaco.
The Frenchman ended up becoming an all-time great at Old Trafford, forming part of some of Sir Alex Ferguson’s best ever sides, winning five Premier League titles, the Champions League and other major honours during his time in England.
Still, Evra was shocked at how much of a step up it was in the Premier League when he was subbed off in a 3-1 defeat to Manchester City.
Speaking about it now, as quoted by the Daily Mirror, the former left-back admits he immediately felt out of his depth and that even his agent told him it was the wrong move to join the club.
He said: “I thought ‘what the hell am I doing here? I was in Monte Carlo chilling, but here the football is so fast. Oh my God you’re so done, Patrice. You should go back to Monte Carlo’.
“I went back to my flat with my agent and his wife and my agent looked at me and said, ‘Patrice, I’m sorry. You’ll never make it, it’s too hard. You should stay in Monte Carlo’.
“That day I was so bad, so embarrassing. My agent was actually telling me I should have never gone to Manchester United!
“So yes, I had this tough moment – but it helped me to become who I am.”
United fans will be glad Evra kept persevering though, as he is now undoubtedly one of their best ever defenders and remains much-loved by MUFC supporters.
It’s clear Evra became used to overcoming huge hurdles, as he also admitted in the same interview that he used to beg on the streets when he was growing up.
“I’ll be honest with you, it was a tough childhood,” he said. “I’ve got many brothers and sisters – so it wasn’t easy living in the streets.
“Sometimes I wasn’t even able to have some food.
“I remember my brother Dominique was working at a McDonalds and so I was going there and on his lunch break he was giving me his own food.
“I’m not scared to say that I’ve begged for money. I’ve been in front of shops and when I’ve seen some people I’ve said, ‘Can I have one pound?’
“And sometimes they gave me the money and sometimes not, just because I wanted to buy a sandwich.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Patrice Evra's agent told him he would never make it at Man Utd after debut</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Patrice Evra has revealed his own agent apologised for sending him to Manchester United and told the full-back he would never be good enough for the Red Devils.
The Frenchman is an Old Trafford legend having won five Premier League titles and a Champions League trophy under Sir Alex Ferguson at United.
Ferguson plucked Evra from Monaco in 2006 and he made his debut against Manchester City, but was substituted at half-time in a 3-1 defeat.
It was a terrible start to his life at United and Evra recalled even his own agent wrote him off.
‘“What the hell am I doing here?” I was chilling in Monte Carlo, but here the football is so fast,’ Evra told UTD Podcast about his beginnings at United.
‘“Oh my God, you’re so done Patrice. You should go back to Monte Carlo”.
‘I remember thinking that and the worst part is when the game was finished.
‘We went back to my flat with my agent and his wife and my agent looked at me like this and said, “Patrice, I’m sorry”. I was like, why? “I’m sorry to bring you here. You’ll never make it, it’s too hard, you should stay in Monte Carlo”.
‘In front of his wife. That day was so bad, so embarrassing.
‘My agent actually telling me I should have never gone to Manchester United.
‘So yeah, I have this tough moment, but it helped me to become who I am.’
Evra would eventually adapt to the Premier League and establish himself as one of United’s best left-backs ever.
The 38-year-old is now a coach at the club and was asked which game he would like most to relive.
‘My first game,’ he replied. ‘My first game, because people ask me, “What’s your best moment?”
‘And they expect me to say something. But I will say the derby, the first game, because everything was new, I received a big slap on my face.
‘I thought I was a big player! My agent didn’t believe in me in front of his wife, Ferguson giving me the hairdryer…
‘It just made me realise, “Hey, you will have to work really hard here if you want to be a United player”.
‘So that’s the moment that I want to relive, because it was a hard moment, but such a positive moment.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Daniel James names Manchester United teammate Juan Mata as his footballing hero</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Wales international James made the switch to Old Trafford from Swansea City last summer and has enjoyed a positive debut campaign in the Premier League.
The 22-year-old has been given the opportunity to play in the same side as someone he looked up to in Mata, admitting that it has been "surreal" to link up with the Spaniard.
"Everyone looks up to Lionel Messi, but I think I've got to go for Juan Mata," he told Sky Sports News.
"I think when I first met him it was just a bit... weird for me. Growing up as a kid looking up to someone and then you're playing with them and not just being great on the pitch, but off the pitch as well. He's someone that inspires me a lot.
"When I first met him, he came and sat next to me in the changing room and said, 'I know it's a big move for you, if you need anything here is my number and if you ever need to talk about anything I'm here.' That was obviously great for me.
"He is so graceful on the pitch. I remember I got one of his shirts, his Europa League shirt when he won it for Chelsea. And he's just someone that I've always looked up to and to play in the same team as him is just surreal for me."
James has a combined nine goals and assists in 27 Premier League appearances for United this term.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Naismith describes 'surreal' Everton goal and trial with Arsenal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Steven Naismith has described the 'surreal' feeling of scoring against Everton and why a trial at Arsenal didn't work out.
The striker spent three and a half years at Goodison Park having joined from Rangers on a free transfer in 2012.
His hard work and cool finishing ability made him a favourite among the Blues fanbase before he left the club to join Norwich in 2016.
However, if things had gone a little differently, that move to Everton might have never come about.
When the forward was still a youngster in Scotland, he had the opportunity to have a trial at Arsenal - but he knew it wasn't the right fit for him from an early stage.
Naismith told evertonfc.com: “I was playing every week for Kilmarnock, so could only go [to the Arsenal trial] during an international break.
“I was at Kilmarnock on £500 a week and half-thinking I’d be going down there to train with the reserves.
“I remember the kit man getting me from reception and and taking me to the dressing room.
“I walked through and there was Emmanuel Adebayor, Theo Walcott, Ashley Cole – and I am this wee guy from Kilmarnock. Not anywhere near that level or involved in that lifestyle.
“There were these players from around the world and I’m thinking, ‘Oh my God’.
“I was staying in a hotel and sat there on the first night and thought, ‘They could offer me anything, here, and I wouldn’t take it’. I didn’t want to move away, I wasn’t ready.
“It was an eye opener in terms of facilities and quality of player. In one drill, Gilberto Silva stood in the centre circle, took a touch with his right foot and pinged the ball out to the winger.
“Then [assistant manager] Pat Rice passed him another ball and he took a touch with his left and drilled it with that foot. You could not tell which was his strongest foot.
“I was just amazed with it all. Kilmarnock did not have a training ground and Arsenal’s facilities were second to none. But I thought, ‘I am not moving away from home’.”
Rather ironically, one of the best moments in Naismith's time at Everton came against the Gunners.
The Scotland international gave the Blues the lead against Arsenal in 2014 as the race for the top four took another swing - with Roberto Martinez's side cruising to a rampant 3-0 win.
And, speaking about his strike, the forward puts his ability to be in the right place at the right time partly down to his dyslexia.
Naismith, who is a long serving ambassador for Dyslexia Scotland, suffers from the condition which affects the ability to read - and it is an issue he has battled to overcome.
“Peripheral vision seems to be much sharper in people who have dyslexia and that is a big attribute of mine on the pitch," he added.
“I can see things happening and seem to be in the right place.
“I’ve watched that goal against Arsenal many times and it is a prime example of me having a decision to make in a split second.
“I can either stay to the left with the defender or run behind him and end up to his right.
“Something in my head made me see the way Rom was shooting and where the ball was likely to go if the goalie saved it.
“I definitely think there is something of my dyslexia in that.”
From the heights of that first season under Martinez, however, things started to decline in later campaigns.
The Spaniard was eventually sacked after Naismith had already left the club, and the striker attempted to put his finger on exactly what went wrong for his former boss.
He remarked: “I’m not sure… there were a few changes in the team and he [Martinez] maybe tried to promote more of the younger boys,” says Naismith.
“The young players we had, their talents were unbelievable: Stonesy [John Stones], Ross Barkley, Gerard Deulofeu, their natural ability was incredible.
“But maybe, at times, the manager was stubborn in the way he wanted to play and kept them in the team. In some games he could have thought, ‘No, let’s just get the result and get out of here’.
“He was adamant on how he played.
“You get to a stage in a match where it might be best to take a point or fight the other team at their own game. But he had no interest in that whatsoever. I admired that in him, though.
“That is why I liked it under him so much. There was a certain way and style of play and it was everything to him.
“You could see that in the way he took us in training and prepared – it was all directed to a definitive way of playing.”
Naismith later returned to Goodison to play against Everton with his new club, scoring in a League Cup victory for Norwich over the Blues in September 2016.
His goal earned an ovation from the home supporters, and he believes that's a testament to the relationship he still holds with the club.
“It [the goal] was really surreal, actually, really surreal,” says Naismith.
“But when I left Everton I knew I had a good relationship with everyone at the club: the squad, the fans and the staff.
“I loved Everton, it was one of my favourite periods in my career. I knew I was a liked figure in the squad, I got on well with everybody.
“To this day I speak to a lot of the boys and coaches. The chairman every so often. You are not just an employee and workmate and you move on.
“These are people who are friends for life.”
In a wide-ranging interview, Naismith discussed his time finding his feet in Scotland, his thoughts of playing under David Moyes and his ambitions for the future - and you can read the full piece HERE.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Daniel James names the Manchester United teammate who left him starstruck</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Daniel James admits he was left starstruck when he first met Juan Mata after moving to Manchester United.
The Wales international completed a dream transfer to Old Trafford last summer when he became the first signing of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's reign.
After a breakthrough season with Swansea in the Championship it was a huge change of scenery for James, but he says his move to Manchester was made easier by the warm welcome of his hero Mata.
When asked to name his football idols as a child James named Mata along with three other greats.
"I've got quite a few," James told Sky Sports.
"I think everyone looks up to (Lionel) Messi but I think I've got to go Juan as someone I always looked up to and to play with him now is surreal for me.
"(Eden) Hazard is one, Thierry Henry, unbelievable. So yeah, I'd go them."
When further pressed on the inclusion of Mata the United forward recalled their first encounter and how he adored the Spaniard from his time at Chelsea.
He added: "I think just what he did, so graceful on the pitch and I remember I got one of his shirts, Europa League shirts, when he won it at Chelsea.
"He is just someone who I always looked up to. To play in the same team is just surreal for me. I think when I first met him it was just a bit weird. Growing up as a kid, looking up to someone and then end up playing with them. Not just being great on the pitch but off the pitch as well, someone that obviously inspire me a lot.
"I think when I first met him he came and sat next to me in the changing room and he said 'I know it is a big move for you, if you need anything here is my number. If you ever need a message, or someone to talk to I'll be here'. That was great for me."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pros and cons on every idea to decide Premier League season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The football season has been decimated by the coronavirus crisis but discussions around a conclusion to the campaign are continuing to orientate.
A number of ideas to conclude the Premier League season have been floated, with the league continuing to discuss potential plans with their stakeholders, though the timeframe to come to a decision is very tight.
Everton are still able to qualify for Europe and Liverpool are two wins away from the title, and both clubs are said to back plans to restart the action.
While the preference is for the season to be completed and all matches played, there are a number of difficult issues to navigate through and, with every proposed plan, there are pros and cons.
Here, we have gone through all of the options along with the positives and negatives of each approach.
The preferred option for the Premier League, which would see all 92 remaining league matches played in neutral venues and behind closed doors - with the season expanded into the summer months.
Pros: No arguments in regards to amount of matches played, can help to provide a morale boost to the country.
Cons: Neutral venues would likely lead to arguments, questions over the health and safety of the players, coaches and staff, criticisms of mass testing in the current environment outside of football.
This method produces a final table by dividing a teams’ current points tally by games played to get a points-per-game average, with goal difference then used as a deciding factor if any clubs have the same total.
Pros: Simple to work out, takes into effect every match already played this season and league table doesn’t alter significantly.
Cons: Relegated teams would certainly appeal, disregards the remaining matches on the fixture list.
The league table is frozen and the current standings are taken as final, with the bottom three relegated, European spots decided and Liverpool crowned champions. Has already been used in France’s Ligue 1.
Pros: Draws a line under the season. The transfer window can go ahead with the current dates and the start of next season would be unaffected.
Cons: Would immediately turn into a legal minefield, integrity of the competition would be questioned.
The nuclear option, and one that has already been put in place in the National League and with Holland’s Eredivisie, is to declare the entire campaign null and void - wiping this seasons records, with no champions or relegation.
A solution would be required to decide the representatives for the European competitions in 2020/21 and it would also require the EFL to take the same approach on their campaigns.
Pros: A clean break, drawing a line under the season. The transfer window can go ahead with the current dates and the start of next season would be unaffected.
Cons: Harsh on those who have performed well this season. Opens the door to legal action from broadcasters and sponsors, who could deny payments or demand refunds.
This method would only take the first 19 games of the season into consideration, which would mean each team has played against each other once and sit on an even amount of matches played.
Pros: Based on actual results, an even amount of games played and the same opponents faced.
Cons: Arguments based on home and away matches, questions over whether 19 games is a fair table.
The current league table would be made final, with Liverpool champions and the European qualification spots would be decided. The difference is that the bottom three would not be relegated, with Leeds United and West Brom promoted from the Championship.
Pros: Draws a line under the current season, doesn’t cause legal action in regards to relegation.
Cons: Expanded league adds to increased fixture congestion next season, unfair on those within Championship playoff spots, would need to be put in place across the EFL.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How every idea to complete the Championship season affects Nottingham Forest</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nottingham Forest's season has been decimated by the coronavirus crisis but discussions around a conclusion to the campaign are ongoing.
A number of ideas to conclude the Championship season have been floated, with the league continuing to discuss potential plans with their stakeholders, though the timeframe to come to a decision is very tight.
While the preference is for the season to be completed and all matches played, there are a number of difficult issues to navigate through and, with every proposed plan, there are pros and cons.
Here, we have gone through all of the options, the positives and negatives of each approach, and how they would affect Sabri Lamouchi's promotion hopefuls.
The preferred option for the Championship, which would see all 92 remaining league matches played behind closed doors at clubs' home stadiums – and not at neutral venues, as ruled out by EFL chairman Rick Parry on Friday. It would see the season expanded into the summer months.
Pros: No arguments in regard to number of matches played, can help to provide a morale boost to the country.
Cons: There are questions over the health and safety of the players, coaches and staff, as well as criticisms of mass testing in the current environment outside of football.
Good news for Forest? Yes. Forest could play their final nine games of the season and hopefully retain their place in the play-off spots, providing a chance for promotion back to the Premier League.
The league table is frozen and the current standings are taken as final, with the bottom three relegated, Leeds United and West Brom promoted.
Pros: Draws a line under the season. The transfer window can go ahead with the current dates and the start of next season would be unaffected. Takes into account every match played so far.
Cons: Would immediately turn into a legal minefield, integrity of the competition would be questioned, particularly as it disregards the remaining matches on the fixture list.
Good news for Forest? No. Forest would stay fifth, but this method is only going to be used if matches cannot played, meaning there would be no play-offs. Either the top two, and only the top two, are promoted, or Fulham also go up from third.
The nuclear option, and one that has already been put in place in the National League and with Holland’s Eredivisie, is to declare the entire campaign null and void – wiping this seasons records, with no champions or relegation.
Pros: A clean break, drawing a line under the season. The transfer window can go ahead with the current dates and the start of next season would be unaffected. No legal challenges from clubs that feel they have been harshly relegated.
Cons: Harsh on those who have performed well this season. Opens the door to legal action from broadcasters and sponsors, who could deny payments or demand refunds.
Good news for Forest? No. This would signal another campaign in the Championship for Forest, with their fine season scrubbed from records.
This method would only take the first 23 games of the season into consideration, which would mean each team has played against each other once and sit on an even amount of matches played.
Pros: Based on actual results, an even amount of games played and the same opponents faced.
Cons: Arguments based on home and away matches, questions over whether 23 games is a fair table.
Good news for Forest? In this scenario, Forest would finish eighth, some way from promotion, which is far from ideal.
The current league table would be made final, with no sides relegated, but with the top two from League One coming up. If the Premier League do not agree to an expanded division and do not allow promotion-chasing Leeds and West Brom to go up, the Championship would be swelled to 26 sides.
Pros: Draws a line under the current season, doesn’t cause legal action in regards to relegation.
Cons: Expanded league adds to increased fixture congestion next season, unfair on those within Championship play-off spots, would need to be put in place across the EFL.
Good news for Forest? Nope. Forest would miss out on promotion, and with more teams in the division next term, a greater proportion of sides, five out of 26, will be relegated, meaning Forest would be at greater risk of dropping into League One.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Every Championship scenario analysed as Cardiff City, Swansea City, Leeds United and West Brom's seasons hang in balance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The football season has been decimated by the coronavirus crisis but discussions around a conclusion to the campaign are continuing to orientate.
A number of ideas to conclude the Championship season have been floated, with the league continuing to discuss potential plans with their stakeholders, though the time frame to come to a decision is very tight.
While the preference is for the season to be completed and all matches played, there are a number of difficult issues to navigate through and, with every proposed plan, there are pros and cons.
As things stand, Cardiff City and Swansea City sit two and three points off the play-off spots respectively, while West Brom and Leeds United sit pretty in the automatic promotion spots.
Here, we have gone through all of the options along with the positives and negatives of each approach.
Behind closed doors
The preferred option for the Championship, which would see all 92 remaining league matches played at neutral venues and behind closed doors - with the season expanded into the summer months.
Pros: No arguments in regards to number of matches played, can help to provide a morale boost to the country.
Cons: Neutral venues would likely lead to arguments, questions over the health and safety of the players, coaches and staff, criticisms of mass testing in the current environment outside of football.
Points per game
This method produces a final table by dividing a teams’ current points tally by games played to get a points-per-game average, with goal difference then used as a deciding factor if any clubs have the same total.
Pros: Simple to work out, takes into effect every match already played this season and league table doesn’t alter significantly.
Cons: Relegated teams would certainly appeal, disregards the remaining matches on the fixture list.
Cancellation with current standings
The league table is frozen and the current standings are taken as final, with the bottom three relegated, Leeds United and West Brom promoted.
Pros: Draws a line under the season. The transfer window can go ahead with the current dates and the start of next season would be unaffected.
Cons: Would immediately turn into a legal minefield, integrity of the competition would be questioned, unclear on what would happen to the third promotion spot.
Null and void
The nuclear option, and one that has already been put in place in the National League and with Holland’s Eredivisie, is to declare the entire campaign null and void - wiping this season's records, with no champions nor relegation.
A solution would be required to decide the representatives for European competitions in 2020/21 and it would also require the EFL to take the same approach on their campaigns.
Pros: A clean break, drawing a line under the season. The transfer window can go ahead with the current dates and the start of next season would, hopefully, be unaffected.
Cons: Harsh on those who have performed well this season. Opens the door to legal action from broadcasters and sponsors, who could deny payments or demand refunds.
The 19-game table
This method would only take the first 19 games of the season into consideration, which would mean each team has played against each other once and sit on an even amount of matches played.
Pros: Based on actual results, an even amount of games played and the same opponents faced.
Cons: Arguments based on home and away matches, questions over whether 19 games is a fair table.
No relegation, 22 teams next season
The current league table would be made final, with Leeds United and West Brom promoted into an expanded 22-team Premier League next season. No relegation, with a 26-team Championship in the 2020/21 campaign.
Pros: Draws a line under the current season, doesn’t cause legal action in regards to relegation.
Cons: Expanded league adds to increased fixture congestion next season, unfair on those within Championship playoff spots, would need to be put in place across the EFL.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cillian Sheridan trusts correct measures will be taken ahead of training return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ireland striker Cillian Sheridan has dismissed fears about returning to training during the coronavirus crisis.
The 31-year-old is due to begin working in small groups with club Wisla Plock in Poland on Monday.
The Ekstraklasa could resume on May 29 if a five-step plan for the country goes ahead, which includes schools and gyms reopening.
Sergio Aguero has raised his concerns about returning to action while three Cologne players have tested positive for Covid-19 after resuming training.
But former Celtic forward Sheridan, who has three caps for Ireland, remains confident.
He told the PA news agency: “It hasn’t been in my thoughts, that part of it, but I can understand people who will be feeling that. Even now it’s not something I’d really be thinking of and, at the same time, I trust what they’re doing.
“The league and FA know the risks if they are making players come back to play. They won’t want to put players’ health at risk. They are going to put things in place to make sure it’s safe for everyone coming back.
“We’ve had to fill in a medical report every day which gets sent to the league so they have been monitoring every player for the last week. They are going to do it for two weeks and as soon as someone flags something up they have to go and isolate.
“As far as I know there are no players here who have caught it here.”
Poland started relaxing some restrictions last month, reopening forests and parks and also outdoor sports areas.
It is hoped full team training will restart in around a week and Sheridan, who moved to Plock in February after a spell with Ironi Kiryat Shmona in Israel, believes players must take responsibility.
“All the players want to get back. Everyone is doing what they need to do,” said the Ireland international, who has taken a pay cut. “The players know it could hurt the clubs if the season isn’t finished, which in turn will hurt the players.
“Everyone has bought into how important it is.
“It’ll be a game very three days, it’s not something you’re ever going to do.“It’ll be interesting how teams manage the games and injuries
“If we have three games in a week, normally you’d have two or three days off but that’s not going to come now.”
The top eight sides play in the championship round while the bottom eight play to avoid relegation with the league hoping to boost its viewers once it returns.
“The aim was to get into the top eight, we’re a point away. If we can win two of the games it should get us there,” said Sheridan, who previously played in Poland for Jagiellonia.
“I think the league has been negotiating to sell the rights to the other countries because they’ll be one of the few playing. Everyone’s going to be wanting to watch sport so they are hopefully going to capitalise on that.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scottish FA vice-president fears 'total disaster' of cancelling next season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scottish Football Association vice-president Mike Mulraney said on Sunday he fears the governing body might face the "total disaster" scenario of cancelling the next domestic season due to the coronavirus.
The Scottish Professional Football League has abandoned the remainder of the current Championship, League One and League Two seasons after a lengthy and controversial process.
There is no decision yet on how to finish the rest of the 2019-20 Scottish Premiership campaign, but it would be no surprise if it is called off after the French and Dutch leagues were abandoned because of the pandemic.
Now Mulraney, who is also chairman of second tier Alloa, says the SFA are planning for potential situations that include restricted fan access and a campaign behind closed doors -- if the 2020-21 season can begin at all.
And he warned it would be "foolhardy" not to face up to the possibility of Scottish clubs going out of business during the health crisis.
"We have run some pretty stark realities we think are real, meaningful and, if not probable, possible," Mulraney told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound programme.
"We have three main visions we see we have to deal with as a club. One is a very restricted fanbase, which we think is a possibility.
"The second is how we would run a season without fans, and then it's the total disaster scenario which we have to look at as a club, which is what if we can't play football for another season?
"The last one is the one you have to look at because right now we can't play football."
On the prospect of playing without fans, Mulraney said: "It would be incredibly difficult, there's no point pretending otherwise. We have run the numbers at Alloa and think we could probably do one season with no fans.
"Football is the fans but if it requires us to do something like this to ensure we have a football product at the end of it, we have to look at how we give media partners content."
After SFA chief medical officer Dr John MacLean admitted the game was likely to remain suspended until September or October, Mulraney added: "We have to give ourselves the best chance but I would not say I expect Alloa Athletic to be playing football in August or September.
"We need to create an environment where we give answers to the public, players, fans, staff and, critically, our government, to allow them to have confidence to restart football in Scotland."

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Football needs to come back' - Kevin Doyle believes Premier League return is needed to lift sporting spirits</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin Doyle believes footballers should be ready to return to action next month, as the former Ireland striker backed proposals for Premier League clubs to commence training again in the next few days.
After the Sunday World broke the story last weekend, revealing details of how football chiefs are hoping to get the final 92 matches of the current English season, Doyle has told us that the resumption of football is needed to lift the spirits of sports fans around the world.
While he accepts there will be some who find talk of a restart to be unpalatable – with the death toll from coronavirus edging towards a horrifying figure of 30,000 in the UK – the former Republic of Ireland striker insists hearts will be warmed if sport returns to our lives.
Doyle believes horse racing, golf and football can return in the next few weeks, as he offered up a considered assessment of why we need sport more than ever before.
"You can ask whether it is morally right for us to be thinking about trying to return to football after thousands of people have just died of this virus in England in the last few weeks," he pondered, in an exclusive interview with the Sunday World.
"That is a tough question to answer, but from a personal perspective, I think we have to try and get sport back on and if the doctors and the experts say it is okay, then we have to go with that.
"There is no chance of fans returning to stadiums for a long time, so it means we have to look at alternative plans and I can't see any harm in it being played behind closed doors," said the striker, who played for Reading, Wolves and Crystal Palace in the Premier League.
"I don't have this view because I'm worried about Liverpool winning the title or who gets relegated. The team I have followed all my life are not involved in the title race this season, so I don't care about the outcome.
"For me, football needs to come back for different reasons as millions of people in England and Ireland are eager for this to happen. I am open to all sports coming back, if we can find a way to do it safely, because people need it in their lives during these difficult times.
"People will be going back to work in the next few weeks, so I don't see why football can't make an attempt to return when some of the lockdown restrictions are relaxed and it would be good for our collective well-being to see football back on our screens.
"There will be people arguing against sport returning, but they probably don't have any interest in it. I think football, horse racing, golf... if we can do it behind closed doors, and do it as safely as possible, we have to try because fans are not coming back for a long time."
While Premier League chiefs are continuing to make plans to resume their season, the French and Dutch leagues have been cancelled in recent days and there are increasing doubts over whether the Italian league will be given the green light to resume by government officials.
There have also been reports that some Premier League players are uncomfortable with the prospect of returning to training in the current climate, yet Doyle insists they should be ready to strap on their boots and get back to work.
"If I was still playing now, I'd want to get out on the pitch as soon as possible," he continues. "Maybe my attitude would be different if I had someone in my family affected by coronavirus, but we have to look at ways to get life moving again.
"We can't go on like this. People are either going to die from the virus or we could be in a position where the whole country is depressed and goes bankrupt as we wait for a vaccine. We have to find some kind of balance in between those two scenarios.
"It will be interesting to see when the final analysis of this period in our lives pans out.
"How many people are going to die after not being able to have cancer treatments? How many will lose their lives due to depression and other issues arising from this?
"I would imagine that figure will probably be even higher than it is for people dying of the virus in Ireland, so we have to try and limit the damage as much as we can.
"Like a lot of people, I gave up watching the news a long time ago. What's the point? These 24-hour news channels have the gloom on all day and after the first two weeks, I decided there was nothing new to learn, so I have avoided them and we need some joy back in our lives."
The UK government and Premier League chiefs will face a backlash if someone playing a part in football's return is infected by Covid-19, but Doyle believes risks can be diluted with careful planning.
"If a footballer catches coronavirus, clearly people will say it was a mistake to try and get the Premier League back so soon, but that could happen when you go to the shops or go back to any kind of work," he adds.
"Are things going to be better in August or September than they are now? We just don't know. It might not get any better, so we have to see what is possible.
"If we have around 300 people working at games, which I'm told is the figure they are looking at to get the Bundesliga games back, then we have to make sure that group of people are tested regularly and they don't let the virus into that group.
"All the players will be tested regularly, they will take every precaution to try and make sure the virus is not getting into dressing rooms, so I don't see why it can't go ahead.
"We didn't know where we were going when they shut sport down a few weeks ago, but we are all used to this new reality now and we have to try and find a way to adapt to the world as it is now – and I think football can be a part of that."
With the UK government appearing to be encouraging the return of the Premier League next month, the prospect of matches returning remains a stated aim of all involved in a story that is likely to have plenty of twists and turns before games are back on our TV screens.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Baroka FC say Prince Nxumalo will be given a chance to prove himself when the Premier Soccer League season resumes.
The 29-year-old former SuperSport United, Ajax Cape Town and Wits striker has struggled for game time with Bakgaga.
He joined the club late last year and had little time to make an impact ahead of the enforced break as a result of the coronavirus.
Baroka chairperson Kurishi Mphahlele says the club have already begun assessing which players will be moved on next season, but are yet to make a decision on Nxumalo.
He told KickOff: "We are still assessing all the players whose contracts are coming to an end.
"Prince Nxumalo is one of them and we haven't made any final decision on some of the players. It's a 50/50 situation.
"Every player must be given a fair chance to prove himself and Nxumalo is one of those.
"Unfortunately he hasn't been getting chances. We just hope football will resume so he and others can be looked at."

“The camps will be for those sports which have qualified for Olympics or the sports whose Olympic qualification is in future,” he said...We will relax things partially looking at the Olympics,” he added.
The national camps were suspended in mid-March when the COVID-19 cases began rising in the country.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said his ministry is devising a plan to ensure a phased resumption of national camps for Olympic-bound athletes by the end of this month but others might have to wait till at least September.
Rijiju said the coronavirus-forced nationwide lockdown, which has been extended till May 17, forced his ministry to delay the resumption of the training camps at Sports Authority of India (SAI) centres. The lockdown was earlier meant to end on May 3.
"The camps will start in a phase-wise manner.

"We will relax things partially looking at the Olympics," he added.
The national camps were suspended in mid-March when the COVID-19 cases began rising in the country.
The pandemic has killed over 1300 people in India while more than 39,000 have tested positive for the deadly infection. Globally, the death toll has crossed 2 lakh.
The Sports Minister said he wanted a resumption of the national camps on Sunday itself but his hands were tied by the extension of the lockdown, which comes under the National Disaster Management Act.
"I thought of starting training of athletes at SAI centres from May 3 but now we will have to do that in a phased manner by the end of this month because sports events don't get any relaxation under the Disaster Management Act.
"We don't fall under essential services," Rijiju said.
Rijiju, however, made it clear athletes of disciplines, which are not in the reckoning for Olympic qualification, will have to wait for a longer duration to start training.
"We will not allow any national camp beyond Olympic-bound athletes or probables. The resumption of such camps (which are not in reckoning for Olympics) may have to wait till September-October this year," he said.
The minister also said that fans will have to wait for a while to see sporting activities on the ground till the pandemic is brought under control.
"Let us not expect any competitive match in near future," Rijiju said.
Rijiju's comments came close on the heels of Indian Olympic Association President Narinder Batra's statement on Saturday that he will ask the government to allow national campers undergo outdoor training inside the country's major sports centres during the lockdown.
The Athletics Federation of India and some athletes at the NIS-Patiala had also written to the Sports Ministry to allow outdoor training.
The Sports Minister said people, including athletes, should expect a lot of changes in their day-to-day life and functioning even after the situation normalises.
"We must accept that things are not going to be as they used to be. We have chalked out certain plans for the future. We are also looking forward to see how India takes up this challenge and emerges as a strong sporting nation post COVID-19," he said.
"Coronavirus is a reality and it is not going to get over soon and so we will have to live with it," he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus wrap: World Rugby struggling to plan for sport’s return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">World Rugby chairman Sir Bill Beaumont admits planning the return of international competition is difficult with countries experiencing varying stages of the coronavirus pandemic and holding different strategies.
The summer tour season in July looks set to be wiped out and the Scottish Rugby Union recently admitted there was “developing uncertainty” over the fate of their November Test schedule at BT Murrayfield.
The Guinness Six Nations is unfinished while the southern hemisphere’s Rugby Championship is due to take place in August and September, but the fate of domestic leagues and European competitions is also uncertain.
Beaumont pledged to get straight to work on dealing with the coronavirus crisis after being re-elected for a second four-year term but he added: “We don’t know when we are going to come out of it. Some countries are coming out of it quicker than others.
“We still have to plan the international games, the domestic games, and already you can see there is difference of opinions from country to country whereby last week the French government said there would be no sport played at all until September 1, and in the UK there is still a desire to get some club games started before then.
“So you can imagine what that is like for us when we are trying to put international matches together.
“Everything at the moment is scenario planning: what if, what if, what if.
“You don’t know if there’s going to be any inter-hemisphere travel at all this year. You don’t know whether you can start behind closed doors, we don’t know when that will be. That will vary from country to country.
“It’s extremely difficult to put a marker down and say we will start now and conclude competitions.”
As Beaumont alluded, the UK Government has held talks with sporting bodies such as the Premier League in a bid to get sport back up and running as soon as it is deemed safe to do so. A best-case scenario date of June 8 is understood to have been earmarked for England’s top-flight football to return at neutral venues.
Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish made the case for football’s swift return if deemed appropriate, arguing it would boost the nation’s finances and mental health, plus help define new ways of working for other industries.
Parish wrote in the Sunday Times: “I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the ‘new normal’ might look for a lot of working environments.
“Not only that, in our country and beyond, people need to find ways to move forward mentally, to experience some small relief from the worries of this crisis. In my view a story here and a conversation there about the game last night will not trivialise loss or suffering but offer a tiny respite from it for many people. Football is meaningless – but it is magnificently meaningless. It has the power to lighten lives; why not see if we can use that power again?”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sir Bill Beaumont plans to resurrect proposals for a new global tournament</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Newly re-elected World Rugby chairman Sir Bill Beaumont has revealed plans for a new global tournament which could lead to two consecutive months of international action.
Beaumont is keen to resurrect plans for an annual competition, possibly with promotion and relegation, which were dropped last year, but stressed the Guinness Six Nations would not be expected to change dates or format.
The former England captain’s challenger and former vice-chairman, Agustin Pichot, was the key driver of the Nations Championship idea but Beaumont has promised to carry it on.
Outside the Six Nations and the southern hemisphere’s four-team Rugby Championship, which is due to take place in August and September this year, a 2017 agreement ensures dates in July and November are set aside for internationals.
Beaumont, who has handed a second four-year term on Saturday, said: “I think there could well be an appetite for putting the two windows together. It could be north going south in one month and then immediately afterwards the south would come north the next month.
“But bear in mind we have to take all stakeholders with us. You have to take the club game and European game with us.”
Beaumont revealed “embryonic” talks had begun with representatives from both hemispheres as well as the International Rugby Players union.
“What we will try to do is bring in a new competition that keeps the Six Nations a standalone competition but there could well be an instance that in the Nations Cup, maybe not all the Six Nations teams are playing at the top level,” he said.
“Sitting below that you could have a subsidiary competition featuring emerging nations and you could well have promotion and relegation. We have to find funding that will enable this emerging nations tournament to take place.”
The 68-year-old added: “I do think there’s an appetite from the Six Nations to look at the Nations Cup. Nobody has ever mentioned to me that the Six Nations would move timescale but in my opinion what would move is July and November.
“Why would you move the Six Nations? It is not affecting anyone else’s window on the global calendar. It’s a six-week tournament that has been played in February/March time since I was a lad.”
Beaumont revealed an independent governance review would be chaired by British Olympic Association chairman and former sports minister Sir Hugh Robertson, with one of the issues being proposals to alter international eligibility rules.
“It would allow players who might have played in a sevens tournament or might have played an odd game for a tier-one nation, to go back,” he said.
“I just think it gives the opportunity to make some countries who are limited in their player resource.
“You also have to think that the grandparent rule, which applies to a lot of Pacific Island players who might not have been born on the island but look upon themselves as Tongans, Samoans or Fijians. As that runs out then it could well be that they find they are losing players.”
The election exposed a north-south divide with Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina all backing Pichot.
Beaumont said: “Whatever happens in life, not everybody is going to agree with you. The question is to try and reach a consensus. I’d like to think throughout my rugby administration, I have been able to reach a consensus.
“I was once part of the RFU when we were kicked out of the Five Nations and had to go to Glasgow to get us back in and managed to do that.”
Beaumont claimed there was no reason why the coronavirus pandemic should derail plans for a global women’s competition and pledged to put player welfare at the heart of every decision.
He said: “When I look at the size of players nowadays, there is precious little room for smaller, skilful players.
“We still have to have a game that is played in 98 per cent of all the world by people at the weekend, girls and boys, men and women, who want to enjoy the game of rugby. We can’t just make it that it’s the domain for huge players.”

The former England captain’s challenger and former vice-chairman, Agustin Pichot, was the key driver of the Nations Championship idea but Beaumont has promised to carry it on.
Outside the Six Nations and the southern hemisphere’s four-team Rugby Championship, which is due to take place in August and September this year, a 2017 agreement ensures dates in July and November are set aside for internationals.
Sir Bill Beaumont talks to the media:
Beaumont, who has handed a second four-year term on Saturday, said: “I think there could well be an appetite for putting the two windows together. It could be north going south in one month and then immediately afterwards the south would come north the next month.
“But bear in mind we have to take all stakeholders with us. You have to take the club game and European game with us.”
Beaumont revealed “embryonic” talks had begun with representatives from both hemispheres as well as the International Rugby Players union.
“What we will try to do is bring in a new competition that keeps the Six Nations a standalone competition but there could well be an instance that in the Nations Cup, maybe not all the Six Nations teams are playing at the top level,” he said.

“Sitting below that you could have a subsidiary competition featuring emerging nations and you could well have promotion and relegation. We have to find funding that will enable this emerging nations tournament to take place.”
The 68-year-old added: “I do think there’s an appetite from the Six Nations to look at the Nations Cup. Nobody has ever mentioned to me that the Six Nations would move timescale but in my opinion what would move is July and November.
“Why would you move the Six Nations? It is not affecting anyone else’s window on the global calendar. It’s a six-week tournament that has been played in February/March time since I was a lad.”
Beaumont revealed an independent governance review would be chaired by British Olympic Association chairman and former sports minister Sir Hugh Robertson, with one of the issues being proposals to alter international eligibility rules.

“It would allow players who might have played in a sevens tournament or might have played an odd game for a tier-one nation, to go back,” he said.
“I just think it gives the opportunity to make some countries who are limited in their player resource.
“You also have to think that the grandparent rule, which applies to a lot of Pacific Island players who might not have been born on the island but look upon themselves as Tongans, Samoans or Fijians. As that runs out then it could well be that they find they are losing players.”
The election exposed a north-south divide with Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina all backing Pichot.
Beaumont said: “Whatever happens in life, not everybody is going to agree with you. The question is to try and reach a consensus. I’d like to think throughout my rugby administration, I have been able to reach a consensus.
“I was once part of the RFU when we were kicked out of the Five Nations and had to go to Glasgow to get us back in and managed to do that.”
Beaumont claimed there was no reason why the coronavirus pandemic should derail plans for a global women’s competition and pledged to put player welfare at the heart of every decision.
He said: “When I look at the size of players nowadays, there is precious little room for smaller, skilful players.
“We still have to have a game that is played in 98 per cent of all the world by people at the weekend, girls and boys, men and women, who want to enjoy the game of rugby. We can’t just make it that it’s the domain for huge players.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">World Rugby’s re-elected chair says “embryonic” talks have begun with representatives from both hemispheres.
Newly re-elected World Rugby chairman Sir Bill Beaumont has revealed plans for a new global tournament which could lead to two consecutive months of international action.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For every Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry, snooker also boasted its bit-part players: the what-might-have-beens and never-minds, who left their own small but indelible mark upon the sport.
For the duration of the postponed World Championships, the PA news agency is turning its focus on the Crucible characters who never quite made the competition’s last three days.
Sporting a reasonable haircut and an average shot-time, John Virgo could well have become the snooker champion time forgot.
As it turns out, Virgo had more cause for fear than most: his biggest triumph, overTerry Griffiths to win the UK Championship in 1979, was not recorded due to the BBC cameramen being on strike.
Virgo came of age in the game when it was still very much a closed shop, making a strong first impression by reaching the semi-finals of the 1977 UK Championships, where he lost to Patsy Fagan.
Two years later, along with his UK win, Virgo reached the World Championship semi-finals, but he would never get beyond the second round in 12 subsequent appearances, winning just four matches in that time.
Nevertheless, Virgo evolved into an unlikely household name, first through the series of impressions he would be called upon to reel off when the Crucible schedule ran short.
And his post-playing career truly rocketed when he became the sidekick of rumbustious comedian Jim Davidson on the popular BBC quiz show ‘Big Break’ throughout the 1990s.
Moreover, Virgo has endured as one of the sport’s most popular commentators, despite a 2016 gaffe in which he was forced to apologise after swearing on air, believing his microphone to be turned off.
Now 74, Virgo’s cries of ‘Where’s the cue ball going?” have become every bit an integral part of the Crucible furniture as those players who have the talent and fortune to be still standing at the end of 17 days.

Heta began his work at 3am with a dismissive 5-0 thrashing of new tour card holder Gary Blades.
Heta hit three 180s and averaged 96, adding afterwards: “On my day I feel like I am unbeatable. I do see myself up there with the best.”
The 32-year-old ‘Heat’ continued his good form with a 5-3 victory over world number 31 John Henderson, sealed with a 121 finish on the bullseye, and needed only three legs in his final outing to progress on leg difference.
He went on to lose 5-3 to Krzysztof Kciuk, taking part in Krakow, missing out on a clean sweep.
“I’m happy I got the win, more or less, but I’d love to win three that’s for sure,” Heta said.
Henderson ended the night by heaping more disappointment on the struggling Blades, winning 5-1 to take second place ahead of Kciuk.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Deciding on a return to action is down to the individual, says Jason Roy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">World Cup winner Jason Roy accepts his role as “a pawn” in debates around when and where cricket should return but believes all players should be free to make their own decisions.
The start of the English season has been pushed back until July 1 at the earliest as a result of the ongoing battle against coronavirus, with the potential for further delays if the situation does not improve.
The England and Wales Cricket Board is nevertheless plotting how matches could be staged as and when it gets a governmental green light to proceed, including the possibility of action behind closed doors in ‘bio-secure’ environments.
The Daily Telegraph reports that England could begin their three-Test series against the West Indies on July 8 with an ECB spokesman confirming “discussions with Cricket West Indies continued on Friday”.
“I think I’ll do what I’m told by bosses. I’m just a pawn in the sporting world,” said Roy, who has played 127 times for his country across all three formats.
“I won’t be going to my bosses and saying ‘put me in the front line’, I’ll just get told what to do. I’ve got a huge amount of trust in the ECB and I think they will look into every single avenue – all the positives, all the negatives.
“So I guess I would trust in what they say, probably have a chat with Morgs (limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan), see where his head’s at and kind of go with that really.
“If an individual wants to go on to the front line and put himself at risk, then good on him. But if somebody doesn’t want to, then I don’t think they should be criticised.”
England is not alone in wondering when it will be able to host elite sport again, with question marks also growing over this year’s Twenty20 World Cup in Australia.
The tournament – which offers the likes of Roy a unique opportunity to become double world champions following England’s famous win in the 50-over competition last summer – is scheduled for October, but at present the idea of 16 teams converging in one place seems a potential health risk.
“If players aren’t able to prepare in the right way and are not able to get over to Australia, then it makes sense to postpone it. But if it goes ahead, it’s our job to play cricket.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Deciding on a return to action should be down to the individual, says Roy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England World Cup winner Jason Roy accepts his role as "a pawn" in debates around when and where cricket should return but believes all players should be free to make their own decisions.
The start of the English season has been pushed back until 1 July at the earliest as a result of the ongoing battle against coronavirus, with the potential for further delays if the situation does not improve.
The England and Wales Cricket Board is nevertheless plotting how matches could be staged as and when it gets a governmental green light to proceed, including the possibility of action behind closed doors in 'bio-secure' environments.
The Daily Telegraph reports that England could begin their three-Test series against the West Indies on 8 July  with an ECB spokesman confirming "discussions with Cricket West Indies continued on Friday".
Meetings will be ongoing over the next few months but Roy is happy to do his job with the bat and let others debate the safety.
"I think I'll do what I'm told by bosses. I'm just a pawn in the sporting world," said Roy, who has played 127 times for his country across all three formats.
"I won't be going to my bosses and saying 'put me in the front line', I'll just get told what to do. I've got a huge amount of trust in the ECB and I think they will look into every single avenue - all the positives, all the negatives.
"So I guess I would trust in what they say, probably have a chat with Morgs (limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan), see where his head's at and kind of go with that really.
"I don't think I'll have too many questions, especially when it got to the stage of 'right, we're going to play' because there'll be a lot of people in those meetings discussing whether it's the right thing to do or not.
"If an individual wants to go on to the front line and put himself at risk, then good on him. But if somebody doesn't want to, then I don't think they should be criticised."
England is not alone in wondering when it will be able to host elite sport again, with question marks also growing over this year's Twenty20 World Cup in Australia.
The tournament - which offers the likes of Roy a unique opportunity to become double world champions following England's famous win in the 50-over competition last summer - is scheduled for October, but at present the idea of 16 teams converging in one place seems a potential health risk.
And Roy admitted players were beginning to ask their own questions: "I think all the boys are on edge, waiting for the call," he said.
"If players aren't able to prepare in the right way and are not able to get over to Australia, then it makes sense to postpone it. But if it goes ahead, it's our job to play cricket.
"If we're told we have three weeks to prepare to go and play in the World T20, all the boys will be putting the yards in to make sure we're ready for that. We'll get in the nets and go hit some balls."
Quite what those first few net sessions will look like is anybody's guess, with the hiatus already into its second month and muscle memory getting a long unscheduled break.

Rory Burns, Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley are all now ahead in the pecking order as openers but a second chance in the middle order has crossed Roy's mind.
He added: "I think they found a nice couple of players to fill that (opening) spot but I worked very, very hard to crack the nut in Test cricket and for it to get taken away from me that quickly, obviously after a couple of bad scores, was really heartbreaking.
"There's no doubt in my mind that I'm going to be trying my hardest to get back into the side.
"Scoring the weight of runs in white ball cricket and then not being able to do that in Test cricket was upsetting for me, because I really felt like I could.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Proof will be in the pudding': Beaumont narrowly wins second term</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Re-elected World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont is under pressure to deliver on his reform agenda after narrowly winning a second term at the global helm of the sport.
Beaumont beat former vice chairman-turned-rival Agustin Pichot by a 28-23 vote announced in Dublin overnight, with Japan and Rugby Africa believed to be among the decisive votes that pushed the result in the incumbent's favour.
French Federation president Bernard Laporte was elected unopposed to the vice-chairman's role, having run alongside Beaumont, and will formally take over from Pichot when the results are ratified at the annual World Rugby Council meeting on May 12.
Beaumont's win was a blow for the SANZAAR nations, all of which threw their support behind Pichot, the former Argentina Test halfback and president of the UAR after a Beaumont-led World Rugby failed to get the global Nations Championship tournament off the ground.
Pichot pitched himself as the more progressive candidate, pledging to re-launch the Nations Championship. Beaumont also added the competition to his platform after ruling out promotion and relegation, which caused it to fall over last year.
Former Wallabies flanker and Rugby Australia director Brett Robinson, who won a second term on the powerful World Rugby Executive Committee in the same elections, said it was up to Beaumont to prove his leadership partnership with Laporte could deliver globally.
"We have very good relationships with Bill and the northern countries. The frustration we've made clear to Bill over the past 12 to 18 months is the pace of change and the need to shift it faster than we were able to, from laws to competition models and other issues," Robinson said.
"This vote showed that a large proportion of the rugby world really is unhappy about what's happened. I think he acknowledges that and acknowledges the need for him to move faster and be open to change.
"We made our position clear to Bill on which way we were going and why, but equally we said that if we was successful we would be doing everything we could to help with his agenda and changing the game."
Robinson's position was echoed by Rugby Australia's interim executive chairman Paul McLean, and New Zealand Rugby chairman Brett Impey.
"We are disappointed for Gus Pichot, who had a strong and progressive vision for the game with an emphasis on global alignment and governance reform.
"With Rugby facing its greatest test in the current COVID-19 pandemic it is essential for the game to act in a unified way to deliver a sustainable future that ensures that all nations have the opportunity to grow and contribute to the ongoing success of the sport."
Impey said: "There is still a level of governance reform that is overdue, and it would be good to see the courage taken to make the decisions needed to ensure the continued sustainability and success of rugby globally — not just for a limited number of unions and regions."
Also included in Beaumont's and Laporte's campaign platform was another look at Regulation 8, which governs Test eligibility. Australia and New Zealand supported a recent push to allow tier one players whose Test careers were over to play Test rugby for a tier two nation for which they might also be eligible. The push failed, but Beaumont has promised to try again.
He has also promised a "wide-ranging governance review" to support a federation that "better serves the game, not one that is seen to only support the 'old guard'".
The pair have work to do to convince the southern hemisphere and other emerging nations that a World Rugby led by French and English power brokers will act in the interests of all of the game's members.
The French and English clubs were among the agitators against the Nations Championship last year, as well as the national unions of Scotland and Italy, who were worried about their capacity to stay in the top division of the proposed league.
Japan and Fiji would be the most likely nations to join the top division, a huge shift in the game's attitude towards the so-called tier two or 'emerging' countries. Beaumont promised to have the competition ready to go after the 2023 World Cup.
The organisation is likely to have more success with cementing a global calendar in the interim, helped, perversely, by the financial chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Northern hemisphere club competitions, where private ownership is widespread, are beginning to feel the pinch.
It was hard work getting the north to agree to moving the June Test window to July, which allowed Super Rugby to continue uninterrupted, but further reform to the Six Nations calendar is also on the table.
"I don't think anyone would agree that the cobbled-together structure of our international game makes sense," Robinson said.
"It's history from when we turned professional in 1995, 1996, that's dictating what it looks like and we have never stepped back and said 'what would be the ideal structure'.
"The flow-on effect of that is that the July and November windows were historical, but not sensible. It's how we get adjustment there that will be key."

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Proof will be in the pudding': Beaumont narrowly wins second term</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Re-elected World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont is under pressure to deliver on his reform agenda after narrowly winning a second term at the global helm of the sport.
Beaumont beat former vice chairman-turned-rival Agustin Pichot by a 28-23 vote announced in Dublin overnight, with Japan and Rugby Africa believed to be among the decisive votes that pushed the result in the incumbent's favour.
French Federation president Bernard Laporte was elected unopposed to the vice-chairman's role, having run alongside Beaumont, and will formally take over from Pichot when the results are ratified at the annual World Rugby Council meeting on May 12.
Beaumont's win was a blow for the SANZAAR nations, all of which threw their support behind Pichot, the former Argentina Test halfback and president of the UAR after a Beaumont-led World Rugby failed to get the global Nations Championship tournament off the ground.
Pichot pitched himself as the more progressive candidate, pledging to re-launch the Nations Championship. Beaumont also added the competition to his platform after ruling out promotion and relegation, which caused it to fall over last year.
Former Wallabies flanker and Rugby Australia director Brett Robinson, who won a second term on the powerful World Rugby Executive Committee in the same elections, said it was up to Beaumont to prove his leadership partnership with Laporte could deliver globally.
"We have very good relationships with Bill and the northern countries. The frustration we've made clear to Bill over the past 12 to 18 months is the pace of change and the need to shift it faster than we were able to, from laws to competition models and other issues," Robinson said.
"This vote showed that a large proportion of the rugby world really is unhappy about what's happened. I think he acknowledges that and acknowledges the need for him to move faster and be open to change.
"We made our position clear to Bill on which way we were going and why, but equally we said that if we was successful we would be doing everything we could to help with his agenda and changing the game."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Bristol Rugby star Agustín Pichot narrowly misses out on World Rugby chairmanship</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Bristol Rugby star Agustín Pichot has narrowly missed out on becoming World Rugby chairman.
Pichot was standing against current incumbent Bill Beaumont, who won by five votes in a 28-23 outcome.
The Argentinian had been Beaumont's vice chairman that had gathered considerable momentum, but Japan and Rugby Africa's votes swung the campaign in former England captain Beaumont's favour.
Pichot, who made 65 appearances for Bristol in a four-year spell between 1999 and 2003, had pledged wide-scale reform if he had won the vote.
The scrum-half had the backing of South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina, who were upset over the fact the proposed Nations Championship had failed to materialise last year.
Yet Beaumont was backed by the Six Nations, whose votes counted for 18 due to a weighted electoral system.
Pichot has now been replaced as vice chairman by France's Bernard Laporte.
Beaumont said: “I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation’s chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support.
“Now is not the time for celebration. We have work to do. We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
“I am determined to ensure the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work in response to an unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bill Beaumont re-elected as chairman of World Rugby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bill Beaumont has been re-elected as World Rugby’s chairman for another four years after overcoming Agustín Pichot in a closely fought election. The former England captain won a margin of five votes, defeating the Argentinian by 28 to 23.
Beaumont, who was first elected chairman in 2016, was the favourite for victory but Pichot, formerly his vice-chairman, mounted a late challenge and gathered considerable momentum. Sources close to Pichot believed the vote was as close as 24-23 in Beaumont’s favour with Japan and Rugby Africa yet to declare their intentions, but both have backed the incumbent.
Beaumont, 68, was considered the safe choice against the revolutionary Pichot, who had pledged wide scale reform. Pichot had the backing of the Sanzaar nations, who were disgruntled that the proposed Nations Championship failed to materialise last year, while Beaumont was backed by the Six Nations, whose votes amounted to 18 in a weighted electoral system. Thanks to additional support from Rugby Europe, Canada, Samoa, Fiji and the split North American vote, Beaumont has clinched victory.
There had been fears from within Beaumont’s camp that the controversy surrounding the key support of Fiji’s Francis Kean, a convicted killer who is facing fresh allegations of homophobia, would derail his bid. Beaumont, however, backed by his new vice-chairman, France’s Bernard Laporte, can now set about shaping rugby’s future in the post-pandemic world.
Voting in the election closed on Thursday but the result was initially not due to be announced until the World Rugby council meeting on May 12th. After a clear winner was determined without the need for a second round of voting, both candidates agreed for the result to be announced on Saturday.
Beaumont said: “I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation’s chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support.
“Now is not the time for celebration. We have work to do.

“I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work in response to an unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bill Beaumont re-elected as World Rugby chairman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bill Beaumont has been re-elected as the chairman of World Rugby after beating back Agustin Pichot in a closely fought race. According to World Rugby, Beaumont won by 28 votes to 23 over the Argentinian darkhorse. The late backing of both Africa and Japan in favour of Beaumont appears to have swung the election in his favour.

Beaumont has called on the game to unite and get working immediately to achieve sustainable growth in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic after being elected for a second term.
Beaumont achieved a first-round majority of 28 votes to 23 in the election which was independently managed by PwC, standing against Pichot, whose maverick candidacy has caused a stir the last month in rugby circles. Pichot had promised a reform of World Rugby in order to better represent Tier 2 nations and to grow the sport beyond its traditional strongholds.
Standing unopposed, Fédération Française de Rugby President Bernard Laporte was elected the new Vice-Chairman. A new Executive Committee was also confirmed with seven new members elected to join the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, CEO and two independents Angela Ruggiero and Lord Mervyn Davies (see below).
Beaumont’s second term will be officially confirmed at World Rugby’s annual meeting of Council on 12 May, after which the new leadership’s four-year mandate will begin. Both candidates agreed to an early announcement given the process concluded at first round stage and no further votes were required for the Vice-Chairman and Executive Committee positions.
Beaumont, in partnership with Laporte, will build on strong foundations to deliver a mandate of progressive reform, uniting stakeholders for the betterment of the game for all.
This will include enhanced governance reform, an aligned and integrated approach to the global intenational calendar, accelerated prioritisation of player welfare, injury-prevention and modified contact variants, accelerated promotion of the women’s game and sustainable investment the sport.

Work is progressing on a global women’s 15s competition and a global men’s emerging nations 15s competition that, alongside a record number of fixtures against top nations, targets union competition needs, provides opportunity for all, enhances Rugby World Cup performance and delivers an annual champion.
“I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation’s Chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support and trust.
“I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we were aligned in many ways and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant.”
Beaumont has called on the organisation to get to work, deliver the sport’s response to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, and implement progressive change: “Over the last four years we have achieved a lot, but we are at half-time and need to press on in the second half. I have a clear mandate to work with Bernard to implement progressive, meaningful and sustainable change.
ADVERTISEMENT
“As an organisation, we must lead, be transparent, accountable and continue to serve for all. We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible. We must listen to players, fans, competitions, our unions and regions, and take decisions that are in the best interests of all with our strong values to the fore.
“Now is not the time for celebration. We have work to do. We are tackling COVID-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
“I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work so far in response to an unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future.”
Laporte added: “Congratulations to my friend Sir Bill Beaumont on his re-election. I would also like to express my best wishes to Agustín Pichot, a legend of Argentinian rugby and a great rugby leader. I also want to thank all unions who have expressed their opinion in this important ballot, giving a clear mandate for the governance which Bill and I will undertake on their behalf.
“During this unprecedented and global COVID-19 crisis, we must act and unite unions from the north and south and the professional leagues around a common objective to define a strong and sustainable future for all. We will pursue these reforms together and act in solidarity with the rugby family, to drive the game forward on and off the field, further the welfare of our players and make the sport more attractive and accessible.”
The new Executive Committee will comprise: Sir Bill Beaumont (Chairman), Bernard Laporte (Vice-Chairman, Fédération Française de Rugby), Brett Gosper (Chief Executive), Angela Ruggiero (Independent), Lord Mervyn Davies (Independent); Mark Alexander (South African Rugby Union), Khaled Babbou (Rugby Africa), Bart Campbell (New Zealand Rugby), Gareth Davies (Welsh Rugby Union), John Jeffrey (Scottish Rugby), Bob Latham (USA Rugby) and Brett Robinson (Rugby Australia).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Who is Toni Kukoc? 5 fast facts about the European prodigy who drew the ire of Michael Jordan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 10-part ESPN documentary"The Last Dance"continues to chronicle the Chicago Bulls' last championship run, and Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman have been the focus through four episodes.
What about Toni Kukoc?
The6-11 forward was a complementary piece on the 1997-98 team, but that doesn't do his story justice. He was one of the most accomplished European players of all time – and one of the targets for Jordan and Pippen because of their angst toward Bulls general manager Jerry Krause.
Here is what you need to know about Kukoc:
MORE: Did Michael Jordan really block Isiah Thomas from making 'Dream Team' roster?
Kukoc began playing basketball for his hometown club in Split, Croatia, at 17 years oldin 1985.The 6-11 forwardquickly developed into a star player and earned the nickname"The Waiter"and was compared to Magic Johnson for his passing skills.
Kukoc was part of three straight FIBA European Champions Cup teamsfrom 1988-91, andhe was named the MVP of the tournament twice.
Kukoc would gain more notoriety for his role onYugoslavia's loaded national team, whichwon the 1990 FIBA World Championships in Argentina.That roster featuredVladeDivac and Drazen Petrovic,and they beat Team USA 99-91 in the semifinals.
Kukoc was named to the all-tournament team, but he was still barely known in the United Statesoutside of Chicago.
The Bulls selected Kukoc with the No. 29 pick in the 1990 NBA Draft.Krause had strong feelings about Kukoc because of his ability to play in the backcourt at6-11.
Despite the hype, Kukoc would not sign with Chicago until 1993, when he was 25 years old.
The tensions between Krause, Jordan and Pippen led to resentment for the Bulls stars toward Kukoc, and that manifested at the 1992Summer Olympics in Barcelona.
Kukoc played for Croatia in the 1992 Summer Olympics, and the team reached the gold-medal game. The"Dream Team"was waiting.
Jordan and Pippen were among the star players on arguably the greatest basketball team ever assembled.
"All we heard in Chicago was how great Toni Kukoc was from Jerry Krause"Jordan said via NBC Sports."(Pippen and I)made a pact that we weren’t going to let this guy do anything against us. It was, ‘OK I got him in the firsthalfand you got him in the second half.’"
The “Dream Team” cruised to a 117-85 victory, and Jordan led the way with 22 points. Pippen added 12 points, and they took turns hounding Kukoc, who had 16 points in the loss.
"They got made when one of the guys let Toni score when they were on the bench," Magic Johnson said.
The Bulls stars made their point.
Kukoc’s first season with Chicago in 1993-94 coincided with Jordan’s retirement. The Bulls made the Eastern Conference finals, and Kukoc might be best remembered for a buzzer-beater he hitagainst the Knicks. Pippen asked to be benched when he was not involved on the play.
Kukoc was a valuable piece off the bench on the second three-peat team when Jordan returned. He won the 1995-96 NBA Sixth Man of the Year award. Kukoc averaged 14.1 points per game in seven seasons with the Bulls, and he played seven more seasons before retiring in 2005-06.
Petrovic died in an auto accident in 1993 after rising to NBA stardom. Divac was an excellent player, but none faced the pressure of Kukoc to deliver.Still, those players andthe DreamTeam’s presence in Barcelona led to a globalization of the NBA game.
More international stars followed. Rik Smits and Detlef Schrempf were excellent players in the 1990s, and that set the stage forPejaStojakovic, Pau Gasol, ManuGinobili, Tony Parker and Dirk Nowitzki the following decade.Giannis Antetokounmpo is the reigning NBA MVP.
Kukocdefinitely playeda role in the globalization of the game.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Michael Jordan’s Agent Claims The NBA Legend Turned Down $100 Million For A Two-Hour Event Appearance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NBA G.O.A.T. Michael Jordan is back in the headlines nearly two decades after his retirement thanks to the ESPN docu-series The Last Dance, which tells the story of Jordan’s final season with the Chicago Bulls. But, according to his agent, David Falk, Jordan isn’t interested in the spotlight since he walked away from his basketball career.
During an appearance on WFAN’s Boomer and Gio this week, Falk explained that Jordan continues to get incredible offers even though he retired from the NBA in 2003. But, he is extremely picky when it comes to the events that he attaches himself to, and money doesn’t matter.
“I brought him a deal three years ago for $100 million. All he had to do was, other than giving his name and likeness, make a one two-hour appearance to announce the deal and he turned it down,” Falk explained.
He says he admires Jordan because the basketball legend has been so successful he has the opportunity to do whatever he wants, and turn down things he doesn’t want. Falk noted that Jordan is “very, very selective in the things he wants to be involved in.”
The Last Dance is a 10-part series that focuses on the Chicago Bulls’ historic 1997-1998 season, which was not only Jordan’s last season with the team, but their last with coach Phil Jackson. On the way to winning their sixth championship in the 1990s, Jordan and his teammates – including Scottie Pippen, Stever Kerr, and notorious bad boy Dennis Rodman – endured a season filled with drama.
Jordan, Coach Jackson, and the Bulls allowed NBA Entertainment to follow them throughout the historic season and document their final championship together. The Last Dance features unprecedented behind-the-scenes access, never-before-seen footage, and interviews with more than 100 people close to the team. Jordan agreed to be filmed during the final season because he had control over the footage. It was up to him if it would ever be turned into a documentary, and he finally agreed to it after the success of  long-form documentaries, like ESPN’s OJ: Made In America and Netflix’s Making A Murderer.
The first two episodes of The Last Dance aired on April 19, and ESPN is airing two new episodes every Sunday night until the finale on May 17. All 10 episodes will air on ESPN and the ESPN App in the U.S. and can be streamed outside the U.S. on Netflix.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Michael Jordan’s Son Has Hilarious Reaction To His Father Allegedly Turning Down $100 Million Deal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Basketball fans that weren’t old enough to watch Michael Jordan play for the Chicago Bulls are having the chance to relive his final season with the franchise because of ESPN’s newest documentary, The Last Dance. Now that Jordan is the topic of conversation in the NBA once again, we’re hearing a bunch of never-before-told stories.
Recently, Jordan’s agent David Falk sat down for an interview on WFAN’s Boomer and Gio. During his time on the show, he revealed that his client turned down a $100 million deal three years ago.
All Jordan would have to do is make a two-hour appearance to announce the deal. However, the greatest basketball player of all-time obviously didn’t want to commit to it. Since Falk shared that story to the world, plenty of sports fans have chimed in on what they would have done.
This includes Jordan’s son, Marcus, who clearly would have been in favor of his father going through with the deal. On Saturday afternoon, he tweeted a hilarious response to the rejected $100 million deal. To make a long story short, he would have tricked his dad into appearing at the event.
Honestly, it would have been pretty funny to see Marcus trick his father.
No matter how you slice it, turning down $100 million is a huge deal. That being said, Jordan has been such a successful person on and off the court that it’s hard to argue against his decision-making.
We should learn more about Jordan’s past on Sunday night, when ESPN airs the next two episodes of The Last Dance.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reggie Miller Agrees Michael Jordan Was Responsible For Isiah Thomas Dream Team Snub (VIDEO)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Dream Team that took the 1992 Barcelona Olympics by storm has become a topic of discussion yet again after Isiah Thomas brought it up during an interview that he thinks him snubbing Bulls legend Michael Jordan of a handshake after a Eastern Conference Finals matchup led to him being left off the team.
Reggie Miller outright agreed with that assessment.
Patrick: Do you think Michael single-handily said ‘I don’t want Isiah on The Dream Team’?
Miller: Yes. Isiah Thomas should have been on that ’92 Dream Team. And people ask ‘who would you have taken off?’ — John Stockton, Clyde Drexler — one of those two guys. Christian Laettner. One of those three guys. Isiah Thomas should have been on that team.
John Stockton, Clyde Drexler, and Christian Laettner are likely going to be upset at Miller choosing them as the ones that should’ve been off the team in favor of Thomas, but this is what happens when you start speaking on players who got snubbed off of a team.
Out of those three, only Laettner is the clear option as he had yet to a second of professional basketball by the time he was called up to make that team. He was the only player on the Dream Team is not looked at as a star during his NBA career.
Miller, who had many battles with Michael Jordan during his career, was then asked if it was true the Bulls legend had the Pistons rival snubbed.
Patrick then wanted to know how it would be possible Thomas could be snubbed from a team that was coached by his very own Pistons head coach Chuck Daly:
We might never get the true answer on what really happened that led to Isiah being off the team.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Anonymous AFC Scout ‘Worried’ Patriots Have A Secret QB Plan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On the surface, the New England Patriots’ plan at the quarterback position heading into the 2020 season is pretty straightforward. Second-year QB Jarrett Stidham is the man tasked with replacing Tom Brady in Foxborough.
Beneath the surface, though, are Bill Belichick and Co. planning a special run at a potentially legendary quarterback prospect?
One anonymous AFC scout reportedly thinks so. And he’s worried about it.
An anonymous evaluator told The Athletic that he thinks Belichick might be planning a run at Clemson quarterback prospect Trevor Lawrence. The former five-star QB is projected to go No. 1 overall in the 2021 NFL Draft, assuming he comes out early.
New England has a bunch of future draft picks. The Patriots could “tank” the 2020 season and, even if they don’t get the No. 1 pick by record, use their draft ammo to trade up for Lawrence.
This anonymous scout isn’t the first person to speculate about this.
FOX Sports 1 host Colin Cowherd has been tweeting out photos of Lawrence in a Patriots jersey. He’s on the Trevor-to-New England train, as well.
It’s difficult to imagine Belichick “tanking” an entire season, but if he really loves Lawrence, maybe that’s something he’d consider doing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Is Jarrett Stidham ready to be Patriots starting quarterback? His former coach thinks so</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A dozen quarterbacks were selected in the 2020 NFL Draft, and nonewere chosen by the Patriots.
The first wave of free agency hascome and gone with quarterbacks finding their new homes. The second wave seems dried up, too, with Andy Dalton now in Dallas and Jameis Winston in New Orleans.
So Bill Belichick either has something up his sleeve, or Jarrett Stidham will be the quarterbackto lead the Patriots into the post-Tom Brady era.
MORE: Why didn't the Patriots draft a QB? Bill Belichick keeps everyone guessing again with NFL Draft strategy
Stidham has four passing attempts in anNFL career that began as the 133rd pick in the 2019 NFL Draft. Two of those attempts were caught by Patriots.Athird was caught by Jets safety Jamal Adams and returned for a touchdown. His resume doesn't stand out, but Belichick must like what he's seen.
Gus Malzahn, Stidham's coach at Auburn, offered some insight on why the Patriots seem to be comfortable handing over the starting job to thesecond-year pro.
"It definitely helped him to learn under the best and see what that looks like, but he's the kind of young man, too, this is what he's been waiting on," Malzahn told ESPN.com. "I'll tell you, the moment won't be too big for him. He'll be up to the challenge, that's what I expect."
Stidham played his final two seasons at Auburn after transferring from Baylor in wake of the program's sexual abuse scandal.
"Even when he got (to Auburn), before he played his first game, you could just kind of tell he was a mature young man," Malzahn told ESPN."Like a gym rat, always at the complex trying to learn, study film. When he got drafted by the Patriots, I thought it was a perfect spot for him system-wise — spreading the field. He's so good with protections, changing protections, and scheme-wise everything that goes with it, and just the flexibility the scheme gives him. I think that really applies to his strength."
In 2017, Stidham led Auburn to the SEC Championship game, one win away from a birth in the College Football Playoff. He was considered a potential first-round pick before 2018, but fell down draft boardsduring the seasonafter Auburn's top two receivers tore their ACLs in the spring.
Stidham was the second-ranked dual-threat quarterback after Kyler Murray in ESPN's 2015recruiting rankings. Per the NFL Network's Peter Schrager, Stidham de-committed from Texas Tech in 2014 following Red Raiders' Patrick Mahomes performance in matchup vs. Baylor in which Mahomes, who was a true freshman, threw for 598 yards in the AT&T Stadium matchup.
Stidham's talent has flashed in the past. The most telling indicator of his ability might just be the moves thePatriots didn't make this offseason. Jordan Love fell in the draft to New England atpick 23, yet they traded down. The Patriots don't have much cap space, but certainly could have afforded the $1 million price tag for Winston.
Bleacher Report's Matt Miller reported that oneagent he spoke withtriedto set up calls with New England to talk about his free agency or quarterback prospects in the draft. "Those calls, per the agent, came and went without a response from the Patriots," Miller wrote.
Stidham isn't a speedster, but he offers the mobility the Patriots haven't had at quarterback with Tom Brady. Stidham might not work out, but all signs point to him being the guy.
A Day 3 pick getting thrown into the action at quarterback? For the Patriots? In just his second year? Success seems like a long shot, but you never know.

    <h5 class="mb-1">OSU football: Analyzing the Cowboys in next year's NFL Draft</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">STILLWATER — The NFL Draft came and went last weekend without an Oklahoma State player hearing his name called.
Not since 2008 has OSU gone silent in the draft. Spare a couple of free agent signings, the Cowboys were hardly on the minds of NFL folks last week.
But that’s not a sign of an inability to develop NFL talent. It’s just that all the NFL talent stayed in Stillwater. Next season, and then the 2021 draft, will prove that.
Running back Chuba Hubbard and receiver Tylan Wallace have first-round potential, and several other Cowboys will be in line to be drafted or signed as free agents afterward.
Let’s take a look at the Cowboys and the 2021 NFL Draft:
The obvious names
Chuba Hubbard, running back: Hubbard has first-round talent, but running backs don’t always carry first-round value these days. Still, he’s going to be high on draft boards.
Tylan Wallace, receiver: Game-changing wideouts are valued better than running backs, and Wallace will contend with anyone in the draft class once he shows he’s healthy after last year’s torn ACL.
Seniors with a shot
Teven Jenkins, offensive tackle: Size, athletic ability and versatility to play either right or left tackle. All of that will make him a mid-round pick with the potential to climb.
Amen Ogbongbemiga, linebacker: His first year as a starter was stellar and his leadership in the middle of the defense is attractive, too.
Rodarius Williams, cornerback: Watching A.J. Green slide off the draft board isn’t encouraging for Williams, but he has another year to prepare.
Dillon Stoner, receiver: Stoner isn’t always flashy, but his reliability as an inside receiver will draw NFL eyeballs.
Cameron Murray, defensive tackle: You could argue Murray was OSU’s most improved player last year, and if he keeps developing, he’ll get more attention for it.
Malcolm Rodriguez, linebacker/safety: His change from safety to linebacker was a monumental move for the OSU defense, but Rodriguez likely has to switch back to safety at the next level. Still, his tackling ability and speed in pursuit make him attractive.
Dylan Galloway, offensive tackle: Entering his third year as a starter, Galloway can play either tackle spot and has the size to get a shot, even if it’s as an undrafted free agent.
Devin Harper, linebacker: Harper has NFL size and ability, but hasn’t been healthy enough to show it on a regular basis.
Landon Wolf, receiver: Undersized, but his hands and speed could land him an undrafted opportunity in a camp.
Calvin Bundage, linebacker: The biggest wild card of all, Bundage has electric playmaking ability, but hasn’t played at full strength since sometime in the fall of 2018. If he can prove he’s healthy, his talent will grab attention.
Early entry possibilities
Kolby Harvell-Peel, safety: OSU already has begun its Jim Thorpe Award push for Harvell-Peel after his superstar sophomore season that ended with a torn ACL in Bedlam.
Josh Sills, offensive guard: He’s been granted a sixth year of eligibility, but there had already been talk of Sills pursuing the NFL rather than transferring when he left West Virginia. A good year could persuade him to test the waters.
Israel Antwine, defensive tackle: Overpowering and versatile, Antwine drew consistent double-teams last season, which will limit statistical production, but stats don’t get defensive tackles drafted anyway.
Jelani Woods, tight end: Woods will be attractive to NFL types when the time comes, but OSU will have to use the tight end more regularly to give him a shot at leaving a year early.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dennis Bergkamp leading consortium aiming to buy Premier League club</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp is part of a consortium looking to buy a Premier League club.
Along with the former Gunners ace is ex- Liverpool star Dirk Kuyt, former Barcelona star Ronald Koeman, Derby manager Phillip Cocu and Henrik Larsson, who plied his trade at Celtic and Manchester United.
The coronavirus crisis has left finances in tatters at clubs and the future is not certain for some.
It has provided the chance for these teams to be bought for peanuts, especially if the lockdown prevents the new season from starting.
Dutch agent Ron Jansen is the brains behind an operation that intends to jump at this opportunity.
He is an executive at Wasserman Media Group, which includes the famous former footballers.
At an estimated £3.2bn, Wasserman is the second-largest sports agency in the world.
Jansen said: “We are in the waiting room, as we call it. In this crisis, the asking price of some clubs will be lowered.
“At the same time the internal - struggles at these clubs will get bigger.”
This summer will be the second time the business has tried to snap up a Premier League club after failing not long ago.
But the 64-year-old has not given up hope despite his disappointment.
Jansen added: “Recently we were very close to a deal. I am not going to say now which club that was, but at the very last moment we were beaten by a foreign investor.
“That was very disappointing.”
Jansen has represented some of the biggest players from Holland in recent years and some have now become business partners.
The six stars joining him in his latest venture have all got experience of working in England, with Bergkamp's star the biggest in this country.
The 50-year-old shot to fame with Arsenal that saw him win three Premier League titles and four FA Cups in an 11-year stint at Highbury.
A statue of him resides outside the Emirates and he is regarded as one of the best players the league has ever seen.
His last hurrah in football came at boyhood club Ajax where he was assistant manager until December 2017.
However, a fallout with club chiefs Marc Overmars and Edwin van der Sar saw him depart.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sports clubs get smarter in their search for top management</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Liverpool football club’s owner Fenway Sports Group identified Jürgen Klopp as the team’s potential manager, it compiled a 60-page report on him. In October 2015, executives interviewed him for several hours at a New York law firm. Today, Mr Klopp’s Liverpool side are reigning European champions.
It is a happy vignette from sports recruitment’s good old days. Now almost all sports leagues worldwide are in lockdown, and the hiring of head coaches and general managers (GMs, a post known in European soccer as “sports director”) has slowed too. Many sports clubs have no idea when their leagues will restart.
Mike Forde, executive chairman of New York-based Sportsology, a consulting group that has advised dozens of professional teams, predicts that if a long pause devastates sports’ finances, clubs will tend to give top jobs to internal hires with briefs to sell players and develop cheap youngsters. But whether clubs recruit for survival or glory, they have begun thinking harder in recent years about how to hire their most senior executives.
Admittedly, most sports recruiting remains more slapdash than Liverpool’s. Clubs traditionally hire from an old-boys’ network of white male ex-players. Any research is usually hasty. A club owner rings a man’s mobile and offers him the job, typically days after sacking the previous incumbent. “Formal recruitment procedures that are considered best practices in non-sport sectors are often ignored, or solely symbolic,” says Stefan Gröschl, an expert on leadership and diversity at Essec business school in France.
But recruitment has slowly professionalised. “The cost per decision has gone up,” explains Mr Forde. In basketball, for instance, a star player can now earn $200 million over five years. No wonder that newer club owners, often with backgrounds in finance, are asking: how to hire the people who hire the players?
Mr Forde, former director of football operations at English Premier League club Chelsea, cautions that head coaches and GMs have limited influence on teams’ results. “Want to be a great coach, get great players,” he says. Luck also plays an outsize role in sports. A mediocre coach can stumble into glory, while a brilliant one can be brought down by injuries and refereeing decisions. “We can’t guarantee success,” admits Mr Forde. Rather, the aim is: “Let’s be a smart business three years from now.”
Sports clubs have room to get smarter. Historically, they lacked sophisticated management structures. An autocratic head coach or GM would run the club almost alone, benefiting from the widespread belief that ex-players like himself possessed a “secret sauce” unavailable to outsiders. His offer to the owner, in Mr Forde’s phrasing, was typically: “Give me the keys, and I’ll screw your Ferrari around. I’ll maybe hit the kerb a few times, then I’ll give you the keys back, and you’ll thank me. You didn’t win anything but you had a nice journey.” The owner was expected to stump up funds without asking questions.
But now autocrats are fading out. “There’s thunderbolts still, with Pat Riley at the Miami Heat, aged 75,” says Mr Forde. “Gregg Popovich at the San Antonio Spurs. Bill Belichick [at the New England Patriots]. But I’d say less than five per cent of sports clubs are run by this iconic person.”
When autocrats leave, their knowledge usually departs with them, particularly as exit interviews remain rare in sport. The first time Mr Forde met Mr Popovich, the legendary basketball coach was sitting at a table covered with cards, each containing an on-field play described with Xs and Os. Mr Forde recalls: “He would say, ‘We’re playing Portland tonight. This is the scouting report.’ And he’d go through it and pick out these cards and put them in his pocket. He said to me, ‘What’s the deal? You want to codify all of this?’”
Manchester United, which has floundered since its longtime manager Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, will recognise the problem. In books and speeches, Sir Alex has struggled to impart his managerial secrets. Perhaps he doesn’t quite know them himself.
Nowadays most owners exert tighter control over decision makers. The old “I played and you didn’t” argument rarely washes any more. Mr Forde advises GMs to engage in dialogue with owners, rather than pushing them away. He tells them: “If the owner is not talking to you, it’s not a good thing. It’s not that he doesn’t have questions. He’s just probably asking them of someone else. It might be his 12-year-old son, the limo driver, or a guy in a bagel shop. It might be an agent.”
Modern coaches and GMs now manage dozens of staff, from data analysts to strength trainers. These little-known and often underpaid specialists sometimes make the difference. Last summer’s star basketball free agent, Kawhi Leonard, chose the Los Angeles Clippers largely for their excellent medical team, says Mr Forde.
A modern club leader plays well with others. Mo Bobat, performance director of the England and Wales Cricket Board, says: “I actually don’t want a coach that has a really strong coaching philosophy, because that suggests he has a fixed modus operandi, when it’s important that he can adapt to the player’s needs.”
The job of a club leader now is complex collaboration. Mr Forde tells prospective candidates for GM posts: “Your first slide, if you’re presenting to us, should be about what you’re not. Because if you’ve got self-awareness, you’re coachable, and more likely to be open to a different structure.”
Many sports organisations have broadened their talent pools. Mr Bobat is comfortable hiring coaches who haven’t played top-level cricket, as long as they are mixed with others who have. “You don’t need to have had a heart attack to be a heart surgeon,” he says. “Not having played at the highest level can be a strength.” He thinks outsiders can challenge sport’s conventions, and bring knowledge from elsewhere. “Much of what I learnt as coach came from my time as a teacher.”
Mr Forde cites last summer’s front-office recruitment by the Washington Wizards basketball team - consulted by Sportsology - as a case study of broad search. The Wizards hired Sashi Brown, a trained lawyer whose sporting experience had been in gridiron football; Daniel Medina, an expert in medical care who began at FC Barcelona; and John Thompson III, longtime head coach of Georgetown University, for his experience with high-school players, who can now directly join NBA franchises. The entire hiring process (including an internal hire as GM) took 126 days, while media and fans accused the team’s owner, Ted Leonsis, of procrastination. Mr Forde fielded anxious early-morning emails from Mr Leonsis. But taking 100 days to hire a GM is becoming common in the NBA.
Nonetheless, many clubs remain stuck in old hiring ways. By the end of last season, only four of 92 managers in English professional football were black men. Female coaches barely exist in men’s sport, though Mr Popovich’s lead assistant coach Becky Hammon is touted as a future head coach. Most hires are still ex-players. Relevant educational qualifications are routinely overlooked. In German football, “very few top graduates of national training centres and academies make it to clubs in leading leagues,” notes Mr Gröschl.
Irrational hiring trends persist: an entire nationality of soccer coaches can suddenly come into fashion, while in the NFL, nearly two-thirds of newly appointed head coaches in the three seasons from 2014/15 had previously been first-time offensive co-ordinators.
Most candidates in sporting job interviews are still “underwhelming”, says Mr Forde. He warns owners: “You’re going to meet people that are not going to blow you away in this traditional market. You’re going to probably end up with a B. The real question is, has he got capability to be an A?”
But then, a “B” leader with excellent players plus luck can end up a champion.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dennis Bergkamp heading star-studded consortium keen to buy English club</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp is leading a consortium of football superstars aiming to buy an English club.
The former Gunners ace has joined forces with Derby manager Phillip Cocu, ex-Liverpool favourite Dirk Kuyt, current Holland coach Ronald Koeman and former Celtic hero Henrik Larsson in a bid to break into the market.
And, with England’s clubs -facing a devastating financial meltdown if the plan to restart the season after the lockdown fails, the belief is that many clubs will be up for grabs in the coming months.
Dutch super-agent Rob Jansen, an executive at global marketing giants Wasserman Media Group, is the -business brain behind the project.
Wasserman is the second largest sports agency in the world, worth an estimated £3.2bn.
Jansen revealed: “We are in the waiting room, as we call it. In this crisis, the asking price of some clubs will be lowered.
“At the same time the internal -struggles at these clubs will get bigger.”
The group failed with a bid to buy a club last year.
Jansen added: “Recently we were very close to a deal. I am not going to say now which club that was, but at the very last moment we were beaten by a foreign investor.
“That was very disappointing.”
Jansen, 64, has been a powerful presence in the game for more than 25 years.
He represented all of his business partners when they were at the height of their fame.
All six men have experience of working inside the English game and are ready to spend their own money to make their dream happen.
Bergkamp, 50, is regarded as one of the Premier League’s greatest players after a 11-year stint at Arsenal that saw him win the Premier League three times and lift the FA Cup on four occasions.
A statue outside the Emirates honours the Dutchman’s service to the Gunners.
But Bergkamp has not been -involved in football since leaving the coaching set-up at Ajax in December 2017 after clashing with executives and former team-mates Edwin van der Sar and Marc Overmars.
He is currently helping out at his daughter’s hockey club.
But he is itching for an opportunity to return to the game he graced with such distinction.
Berkamp would want a hands-on role at any potential club.
He is eyeing a position that would allow him to oversee the entire -set-up, with emphasis on developing a pathway for young players from the academy to the senior team.
Bergkamp’s business partners also come from fine footballing stock.
We're testing a new site: This content is coming soon
Kuyt, 39, was a firm favourite during six years at Anfield and has been working in the youth system at Feyenoord since retiring.
And 48-year-old Larsson is boss of Helsingborgs after a playing career that included spells at Manchester United, Celtic and Barcelona.
Former Southampton and Everton boss Koeman also played for Barca.
As did Cocu, who became Derby manager last summer and guided PSV Eindhoven to their first Dutch title in seven years back in 2015.
The move could not be better timed, as Newcastle are on the verge of a £300m takeover backed by the government of Saudi Arabia.
But EFL and Premier League clubs face losses of millions if the proposed restart has to be halted.
Those losses could open the door for new investors like the ones being advised by Jansen.

Jansen revealed: “We are in the waiting room, as we call it. In this crisis, the asking price of some clubs will be lowered.
“At the same time the internal -struggles at these clubs will get bigger.”
The group failed with a bid to buy a club last year.
Jansen added: “Recently we were very close to a deal. I am not going to say now which club that was, but at the very last moment we were beaten by a foreign investor.
“That was very disappointing.”
Jansen, 64, has been a powerful presence in the game for more than 25 years.
He represented all of his business partners when they were at the height of their fame.
All six men have experience of working inside the English game and are ready to spend their own money to make their dream happen.
Bergkamp, 50, is regarded as one of the Premier League’s greatest players after a 11-year stint at Arsenal that saw him win the Premier League three times and lift the FA Cup on four occasions.
A statue outside the Emirates honours the Dutchman’s service to the Gunners.
But Bergkamp has not been -involved in football since leaving the coaching set-up at Ajax in December 2017 after clashing with executives and former team-mates Edwin van der Sar and Marc Overmars.
He is currently helping out at his daughter’s hockey club.
But he is itching for an opportunity to return to the game he graced with such distinction.
Berkamp would want a hands-on role at any potential club.
He is eyeing a position that would allow him to oversee the entire -set-up, with emphasis on developing a pathway for young players from the academy to the senior team.
Bergkamp’s business partners also come from fine footballing stock.
Kuyt, 39, was a firm favourite during six years at Anfield and has been working in the youth system at Feyenoord since retiring.
And 48-year-old Larsson is boss of Helsingborgs after a playing career that included spells at Manchester United, Celtic and Barcelona.
Former Southampton and Everton boss Koeman also played for Barca.
As did Cocu, who became Derby manager last summer and guided PSV Eindhoven to their first Dutch title in seven years back in 2015.
The move could not be better timed, as Newcastle are on the verge of a £300m takeover backed by the government of Saudi Arabia.
But EFL and Premier League clubs face losses of millions if the proposed restart has to be halted.
Those losses could open the door for new investors like the ones being advised by Jansen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chief hints at potential summer sale of £53m-rated Man United and Arsenal target</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to Goal via Sport1, RB Leipzig chief Oliver Mintzlaff has hinted that the German giants could sell Manchester United and Arsenal target Dayot Upamecano this summer.
The 21-year-old, who Goal claim is also catching the eye of Bayern Munich and Manchester City, is about to enter the final year of his contract – casting doubt over his future with Leipzig.
Mintzlaff seems to be defiant with his statement that ‘it is a no go that the top performers will be allowed to leave our club free of charge’.
Should the Frenchman fail to agree a new contract with the Bundesliga outfit before the summer, Goal claim that Leipzig would move to sell the ace for a fee of €60m (£53m).
Here’s what managing director Oliver Mintzlaff had to say:
“In the Covid-19 crisis, we have other issues greater than concerns about contracts,”
“We know the terms of our players’ contracts and I know them very well – especially that of our top performers.”
“For us, it is a no go that the top performers will be allowed to leave our club free of charge.”
“That’s the case with Timo Werner and that will be the case with Dayot Upamecano. I have the economic stability of the club in mind.”
“We have to sell before we buy anything. But I see the need to sell only to a limited extent. We have a good squad,”
“If we can’t finish the season, we don’t have to deal with new transfers at all. It wouldn’t fit into the big financial loss that we have.”
Upamecano has firmly established himself as one of the world’s top defensive talents since joining Leipzig just over three years ago.
The 21-year-old has made 29 appearances for Leipzig this season and he’s continued to show that he’s a real star for the future with some fine performances.
A move to one of the top clubs that are being linked with his services would also massively boost the France Under-21s star’s hopes of breaking into Didier Deschamps’ senior side.
Arsenal and United are particularly in need of bolstering at centre-back in the next transfer window.
Mikel Arteta’s side still possess a shaky defence, the Gunners also need to replace the likes of David Luiz and Sokratis who are approaching the final years of their illustrious careers.
The Red Devils on the other hand need to find a reliable long-term partner for Harry Maguire, who has become the side’s captain just months after joining in a marquee move last summer.
Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly have proved that they aren’t reliable options due to the Swede’s inconsistent form and the Ivorian’s troubles with injuries.
With all respect, Phil Jones should be completely out of the question as United look for a commanding centre-back to partner Maguire.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Liverpool target Werner rules out Bayern Munich transfer, prefers move abroad</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner has ruled out a switch to Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich and said he would prefer a move abroad.
Werner, 24, has a contract until 2023 and a release clause in the €50 million to €60m region which allows him to leave Leipzig this summer.

The Germany international has been linked with a move away but said Bayern is not an option for him in the future.
"Bayern are a great club, we don't need to talk about it, and Hansi Flick has proven this season he is a really good head coach," he told Bild.
"But if a move were to become an issue at some point, I would be more tempted by a move abroad than a move to Bayern.
"It's just that the challenge of another league would appeal to me a little more than a move within the Bundesliga.
"Of course, it also important that mutual respect is there as much as possible. That's why I chose RB Leipzig at the time, and why I would choose the club for [the] next step as one where I would get that feeling."
Reports have suggested that Liverpool are interested in the striker and Werner said he was proud to be linked with "the best team in the world."
However, Leipzig sporting director Markus Krosche has said the striker could stay at the club due to the uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Before the global outbreak halted the sport, Werner scored 27 goals in all competitions this season and helped Leipzig progress to the Champions League quarterfinals.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Odsonne Edouard's next transfer move as Arsenal target Aubameyang replacement</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Arsenal transfer target Odsonne Edouard will be on his way from Celtic to the Premier League this summer.
That's the verdict of former Hoops player Frank McGarvey, who has seen the striker smash 24 goals for the Scottish Premier League leaders this season.
Arsenal have been linked with a move for the 22-year-old striker, amid continued speculation that top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be on his way out of the Emirates this summer.
McGarvey compared Edouard to Gunners and Celtic legend Charlie Nicholas, saying he "has that bit of magic in his feet".
And he reckons the France under-21 striker will be snapped up for £20million this summer - whether that's by Mikel Arteta's side or one of their Premier League rivals.
“I just love watching Edouard. He has that bit of magic in his feet, and he reminds me of Charlie Nicholas,” McGarvey told The Scottish Sun.
“You just know if he gets the ball just outside of the box the other team are in trouble. Edouard has that ability to produce something out of nothing because he has such quick feet.
“I think someone will come in this summer and put £20m on the table for him. You can’t blame Celtic for taking it, especially in the current climate.”
While McGarvey compared him to Nicholas, the former Arsenal midfielder himself said Arteta must "get the whole team right" for Edouard to thrive.
"He could certainly play at Arsenal because the way they play, his style would be more than suitable for it," Nicolas told Sky Sports.
"The problem is getting the judgement right over whether he's ready right now, playing every week for Arsenal compared to who is there already.
"He certainly would not come to England straightaway and score 20 to 25 goals in a season unless Arsenal find a renewed belief and they get the whole team right."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pundit says £9m striker would ‘walk into’ Arsenal’s first team, has ‘everything you want’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sky Sports pundit Kris Boyd has claimed that reported Arsenal target Odsonne Edouard would “walk into” Mikel Arteta’s team at the Emirates Stadium (The Scottish Sun).
According to The Mirror, the Gunners are interested in the highly rated Celtic 22-year-old, who has claimed an impressive 60 goals and 31 assists in 126 Hoops appearances.
Arsenal boss Arteta reportedly plans to bolster his ranks this summer amid an uncertain future for the club’s main frontmen, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette.
Edouard has played for Celtic since the summer of 2017, when he initially joined on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, and joined the Bhoys permanently the following year for a club record £9million (Sky Sports).
This season alone, the Frenchman has 27 goals and 19 assists from 45 games in all competitions, showing he’s not only a clinical, prolific goal machine but also a selfless provider for his teammates.
While there will sometimes be doubts over whether a Scottish Premiership talent can cut it south of the border, Rangers legend Boyd has no qualms about Edouard’s quality translating to the Premier League.
“I honestly believe Edouard could go all the way,” he told the Scottish Sun. “There’s no doubt he could walk into the Arsenal team.
“Edouard has everything you want in a modern striker. Whether he leaves Celtic this summer is down to him.”
Boyd isn’t the only pundit to ‘break rank’ when it comes to praising someone plying his trade for Rangers’ bitter rivals – Steven Gerrard’s friend and former teammate Jamie Carragher recently said Edouard was the best player in Scotland (Instagram, via the Daily Record).
Celtic’s record signing has been nothing short of sensational since arriving at Parkhead and his £9million fee seems a snip now, but surely it’s now only a matter of time before he ups sticks and heads to one of Europe’s elite clubs.
Arsenal have endured a difficult season and, with questions over the futures of both Aubameyang and Lacazette, Arteta is likely to dip into the market for a new frontman.
Pundits are running out of superlatives to send Edouard’s way, and his scoring and assisting record speaks for itself – he is ready for a big career move, and Arsenal, a club eager to get back to the top table, seems like a great fit for him.

    <h5 class="mb-1">British champion Alice Barnes set for Zwift event</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">British national champion Alice Barnes expected to spend this weekend racing at the Tour de Yorkshire but instead is preparing for a very different challenge when Zwift’s Tour for All launches on Monday.
For the next five days, riders from a number of professional men’s and women’s teams will compete in online races as part of a month-long charity fundraising initiative open to the public on Zwift’s virtual platform.
Line-ups will change daily as teams rotate their riders, but British duo Adam and Simon Yates are in Mitchelton-Scott’s squad for the event, while Barnes can expect to face former world champions Marianne Vos (CCC Liv) and Anna Van Der Breggen (Boels Dolmans) in the women’s event.
Zwift will donate 125,000 US dollars (£100,000) to Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres throughout the event, a sum which will be doubled if 250,000 people complete a stage.
For Canyon-SRAM rider Barnes, the race offers some welcome competition as she awaits the UCI’s planned announcement on Tuesday on when WorldTour racing might be able to resume.
“Zwift races are really important not only to maintain some focus and racing intensity but also for exposure for the team,” Barnes told the PA news agency.
“I would love to be racing and I am missing the adrenaline of being in the bunch but I am grateful for my situation.
“I think at the moment there are a lot worse problems in the world than our sport. We will have to wait for when the time is right to get racing again and make sure that we are ready for it.”
The racing will be broadcast live via the Global Cycling Network and Eurosport, with the women’s races taking place ahead of the men’s.
Monday’s opening stage will be a 52.9km test on a virtual edition of the Innsbruck circuit used in the 2018 Road World Championships – which is when Van Der Breggen claimed the rainbow stripes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Own goals during the coronavirus lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rojo has become the latest Premier League player to break coronavirus lockdown rules.
It is the latest in a string of own goals in the sport since the pandemic started.
Here, the PA news agency looks at the high-profile ones.
Police were called to the Dickens Heath area of Solihull to reports that a Range Rover had crashed into two parked cars, with pictures emerging online of the Aston Villa midfielder in slippers and a bright blue hoodie. Grealish later said he was “deeply embarrassed” after he “stupidly agreed” to go to a friend’s house – less than a day after launching a video appeal for people to stay at home during the Government-enforced lockdown.
The Manchester City and England full-back said sorry after it was widely reported he held a party at his home, with the threat of disciplinary action following as his club promised an “internal disciplinary procedure”. Like Grealish, he had earlier urged the public to follow the Government advice.
Tottenham’s players were spotted flouting social distancing rules as Jose Mourinho was seen working in a Barnet park with Tanguy Ndombele. Davinson Sanchez and Ryan Sessegnon were also caught by a social media user running side by side around the same park and Serge Aurier also posted a video of himself on Instagram jogging alongside another person. The club, who also reversed their decision to furlough staff following a backlash, underlined the Government’s Covid-19 regulations to their players. But little over a fortnight later, Aurier was at it again, posting a video on his Instagram Story of him training with team-mate Moussa Sissoko before deleting it.
Liverpool did the same as Spurs. The Premier League leaders, who in February announced pre-tax profits of £42million for 2018-19, furloughed some non-playing staff before performing a U-turn on the decision, with chief executive Peter Moore admitting they came to the “wrong conclusion”. Bournemouth also followed suit.
Arsenal were forced to speak to David Luiz, Alexandre Lacazette, Nicolas Pepe and Granit Xhaka after they were pictured flouting Government guidelines on social distancing. Luiz and Xhaka were seen meeting up in a park in north London, a video emerged of Pepe playing football with his friends, while Lacazette was pictured getting too close to a man valeting his car on his drive.
Everton labelled Kean’s actions “unacceptable” after he filmed himself partying at home with guests in a breach of social distancing regulations. The Toffees said in a statement: “Everton Football Club was appalled to learn of an incident in which a first-team player ignored Government guidance and club policy in relation to the coronavirus crisis. The club has strongly expressed its disappointment to the player and made it clear that such actions are completely unacceptable.”
The PA news agency understands Manchester United will remind Marcos Rojo of his responsibilities after the defender was filmed appearing to flout Argentina’s lockdown rules. The 30-year-old, on loan at Estudiantes, was seen playing cards and smoking with friends in his homeland, where president Alberto Fernandez recently extended lockdown until May 10.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Alex Albon claimed his first Formula One Esports Virtual Grand Prix win, denying Charles Leclerc a third straight success.
Red Bull driver Albon took the lead on the first turn after a faltering start from pole-sitter Stoffel Vandoorne and exchanged it with Ferrari rival Leclerc on countless occasions throughout the race.
The pair overtook at every opportunity on the simulated Interlagos track – chosen as a stand-in for Zandvoort, which was not available on the game – but a three-second time penalty effectively scuppered Leclerc’s hopes.
He continued pushing Albon to the line but the Londoner held on and Leclerc’s penalty, once applied, saw him slip to third behind George Russell.
Albon told Sky Sports F1 that a surprising pit-stop choice from Leclerc had given him the advantage.
“I definitely had the better strategy,” he said.
“Charles was very quick on pace, I was quite surprised because I thought he was going to go soft-medium and he decided to pit earlier. He kept overtaking me and I was getting nervous…it was all going on.”
Asked to estimate the number of times the pair had swapped the lead, he added: “In 36 laps…I would say 20 overtakes, maybe 25. It was proper fun.”
In the battle of the England cricket stars, Ben Stokes – on his second outing – was too quick for fellow guest driver Stuart Broad.
“I took part in Australia, which went horrendously, but today was good because I had a bit on it with my mate,” he said.
“Me and Stuart have been training together but as soon as we knew we were going to do the proper race it threw all that out of the window.”
Asked if he would be back in two weeks for a virtual Spanish Grand Prix, he responded: “I’ll have to look at the track.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘World Test Championship points system is ridiculous’, says Michael Holding</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">West Indies fast bowling great Michael Holding has termed the World Test Championship’s points system as “ridiculous”, where some of the Tests will be rendered inconsequential once teams realise that they can’t finish in top two in the points table.
As per the current points system, the value for each Test match win in a two-match series is 60 points a game.
However, if it’s a five-match series, the value of a Test match win is reduced to 24. So basically, a team can gain up to 120 points from a series, regardless of the number of matches. The top two qualify for the final.
The Test Championship, which is scheduled to finish with a final at Lord’s in June 2021, was introduced by the ICC last year in a bid to revive bilateral Test cricket.
“It doesn’t work,” Holding told Wisden Cricket Monthly during a round table when asked if the Test championship was achieving what it was designed for.
“First of all, the points system is ridiculous. You can’t play five Test matches and get the same amount of points if you play two Test matches.
“And secondly, at some point you’re going to have teams who know they cannot get to the final and so those Test matches aren’t going to be all that entertaining. People know it’s just another game.”
England fast bowler Chris Woakes, who was also part of the round table, said the points system might need to be tweaked in future.
“The New Zealand series (England lost 1-0 away to the Black Caps last winter) wasn’t part of the World Test Championship but that defeat didn’t affect us any less as players,” Woakes said.
“I think the system might need a bit of tinkering with in the future. Anyone can turn someone over in a one-off final, depending on the toss or conditions. If there was more time in the calendar they could do a three-match final but unfortunately there just isn’t,” he said.
India are currently leading the World Test Championship which has been thrown out of gear due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw the postponement of a number of series.
In February this year, New Zealand captain Kane Williamson had said there are elements of the points system used for the World Test Championship which are “unfair”.

As per the current points system, teams will play for 120 points from a series, equally divided by the number of matches as agreed upon by the boards. So, the value for each Test match win in a two-match series is 60 points a game. If it’s a five-match series, the value of a Test match win is reduced to 24. The number of matches played by each team over the duration of the championship is not uniform either.
The top two teams in the final standings then qualify for the final.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holding heaps scorn on 'ridiculous' ICC Test Championships</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Legendary West Indies fast bowler turned commentator Michael Holding has heaped criticism on the newly introduced International Cricket Council (ICC) World Test Championships (WTC) series.
The competition, which was introduced in August of last year, is meant to be the premier championship for Test cricket.
The tournament features nine of the twelve Test-playing nations, each of whom plays a Test series against six of the other eight teams. Each series consists of between two and five matches, so although all teams will play six series (three at home and three away), they will not play the same number of Tests. Each team will be able to score a maximum of 120 points from each series and the two teams with the most points at the end of the league stage will contest the final.
Holding has however taken exception with both the format of the competition and its established points system.
"It doesn't work," Holding was quoted as saying by Wisden. "First of all, the points system is ridiculous. You can't play five Test matches and get the same amount of points if you play two Test matches,” he added.
"And secondly, at some point, you're going to have teams who know they cannot get to the final and so those Test matches aren't going to be all that entertaining. People know it's just another game."

    <h5 class="mb-1">No sparring in the time of lockdown for boxers till guidelines on safety in place</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There is still some time before training resumes at national camps but even when it does, boxers will not engage in any sparring till clear guidelines are in place to ensure their safety in a world scarred by the COVID-19pandemic.
Six-time world champion M C Mary Kom has made it clear that she won’t recommend sparring at a time when even a touch of the hand is being seen as potentially infection-causing.
“For the time being, I don’t see any sparring happening in training at least, I would be totally against it. I believe training itself will become very individualistic,” she told PTI in a recent interaction.
Sports minister Kiren Rijiju, following an online interaction with the Boxing Federation of India President Ajay Singh and the boxers, including Mary Kom, on Sunday said all necessary precautions will be put in place before sparring can commence again.
“We will have to discuss with technical officials, high-performance directors, and most importantly health professionals to assess the precautions we have to put in place before our athletes begin practising with their sparring partners,” he said.
“We have to do thorough medical check-ups, put the partners in quarantine if needed before training can begin,” he added.
The minister, earlier in the day, said national camps, shut since mid-March due to the coronavirus-forced lockdown, will restart in a phased manner by the end of this month at least for Olympic-bound athletes.
Indian Boxing’s High-Performance Director Santiago Nieva told PTI that camps, when they resume, will not have sparring sessions unless clear instructions are provided on the protocol to follow.
“There will not be any sparring without a protocol in place,” he said.
“In my opinion, in a closed environment, from which nobody goes out after checking in, sparring can take place. We just have to ensure that the selected group is isolated from others,” he added.
The deadly infection, which has changed the world in a matter of months, has caused over 2 lakh deaths across the globe.
In India, the death toll has crossed 1300 and more than 39,000 have been infected by the virus which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in November last year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 28-year-old, who has scored three times and contributed two assists in 18 appearances for Los Blancos this season, has allegedly been made available for transfer this summer.
Chelseaare believed to be interested in bringing the Spaniard - out of contract next summer - to Stamford Bridge.
Vazquez has said that he wants to retire at Madrid but has opened the door on a potential move to the Premier League as the speculation surrounding his future continues.
"The dream is to retire at Madrid but in football, you don't know," Vazquez told The Guardian. "When I was little, I always watched the Premier League with my brother. It was, it is, very attractive: a nice football to play, one that could fit my characteristics and personality well."
The Spain international has featured on 201 occasions for Los Blancos in all competitions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vazquez dreams of retiring at Madrid</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lucas Vazquez dreams of retiring at Real Madrid but believes he would adapt well to the Premier League.
Save for a season on loan at Espanyol, Vazquez has spent his entire professional career at Madrid.
He has won the Champions League three times while also lifting the LaLiga title in 2017.
The winger is out of contract at the end of next season but wants to remain a one-club man.
Vazquez told The Guardian: "The dream is to retire at Madrid but in football you don't know.
"When I was little, I always watched the Premier League with my brother. It was, it is, very attractive: a nice football to play, one that could fit my characteristics and personality well."
LaLiga remains suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic but a return appears to be edging closer, with players allowed to resume training this month.
Madrid trailed LaLiga leaders Barcelona by two points when the season was brought to a halt.
"Above all, you have to be responsible. If we can play, with the right safety measures, we'd all love to complete the season," Vazquez added.
"It would be good for people, for society: for two hours you're not just thinking only about this [virus]. Football brings happiness."
Asked about the prospect of playing behind closed doors without fans, Vazquez replied: "I've played behind closed doors and it was strange.
"Being able to communicate, hearing everything, is odd. If the manager is on one wing and I'm on the other, he's got to express with gestures or I haven't got a clue.
"You can always blame the noise when you don't do what he says. Just not if it's empty."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Balotelli at Liverpool, Veron at Man United, De Bruyne at Chelsea among top transfers we wish had worked</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Top clubs don't always get transfers right, but which deals from history do we wish had worked out better than they did?
10. Kevin De Bruyne at Chelsea
De Bruyne and then-Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will tell you different stories about what happened to the Belgian at Stamford Bridge in 2012-14. Either way, De Bruyne made only nine appearances for the Blues before being shipped out on loan and was eventually sold to Wolfsburg for £18m. Now a world-class midfielder at Manchester City, his career has panned out pretty well since, so we wonder what he would've done under Mourinho? After all, he's quite a Mourinho style of player -- strong, direct, adaptable, tactically disciplined when required -- so it could have been a match made in heaven. And we won't even mention that Mourinho later made the same mistake with Mohamed Salah. Oh wait, we did.
9) Angel Di Maria at Manchester United
No one player could have halted the post-Sir Alex Ferguson slide at Manchester United, such were the problems at the club that were papered over by one man's genius, but when they spent a British record £59.7m on Real Madrid winger Di Maria in 2014, after a year of struggles under David Moyes, there was a genuine sense that this was a step back toward the big time. Di Maria's failure in England was partly down to injuries, partly down to his relationship with manager Louis van Gaal, but also partly because of the attempted robbery in January 2015 that reportedly affected him and his family so badly that they left England at the first available opportunity. Had a few things been different, he could have led a more convincing United revival. Instead he left for PSG a year later at a £15m loss.
8) Paul Gascoigne at Lazio
You could argue Gascoigne's whole career was one long "we wished it had worked out," but in particular the England midfielder's £5.5m move to Lazio felt like such a waste. Of course, it was doomed before he even arrived, a knee injury suffered in the 1991 FA Cup final while playing for Tottenham pushed the transfer back a year and when he did arrive in Italy, fitness problems stalked his every move. Of course, Gascoigne's issues did not stop at his cruciate ligament, and perhaps nothing could have saved him, but at a time when English football was emerging from its darkest period in a generation, having a genuine superstar succeed abroad would have been glorious.

7) Andriy Shevchenko at Chelsea
In the summer of 2006 it felt as if Chelsea had accessed a video game cheat code. Surely it wasn't fair to the rest of the division that the team who had won the last two Premier League titles be allowed to sign one of the world's best strikers for £30m. But what should have been a perfect pairing of a nouveau riche club and an aristocrat of a centre-forward didn't work. Having netted 127 goals in 208 Serie A games for Milan, Shevchenko struggled in England and could net only nine in 48 in the Premier League. Nothing especially dramatic happened, it's just that everything was a little off and his career petered out with a return to Ukraine.
6) Jonathan Woodgate at Real Madrid
At what point did you start to feel sorry for Woodgate in his three-year spell at Real Madrid? Was it during his infamously calamitous debut when he scored an own-goal and got sent off? Or was it before that, given he was able to make his debut only a year after signing from Newcastle for £13.4m in August 2004 after the smorgasbord of injuries that had dogged his career prevented him from playing? Woodgate could have been one of the great defenders of his generation had those injuries not scuppered things, and while he retains a tragicomic cult-hero status in Madrid, it's possible he could have been just a straight-up hero.
5) Gaizka Mendieta at Lazio
Very often the secret of a good transfer is timing, but Mendieta's €47.7m move from Valencia to Lazio in 2001 must be about the worst-timed ever. The midfielder left Valencia just after they had lost their second Champions League final in two years -- also the summer before Rafa Benitez arrived and won the first of their two La Liga titles -- and joined Lazio, at that stage only a year after they had won Serie A. He never adapted to Italian football, at least in part thanks to a team changing around him as their financial apocalypse closed in, and played 31 times for the club before being sent on loan to Barcelona and Middlesbrough, whom he later joined permanently. At his peak, Mendieta was a beautiful player, a classic midfield string-puller, running games in a low-key sort of way, and it would have been wonderful had his talent been rewarded with a major title.
4) Fernando Redondo at Milan
Argentina midfielder Redondo never wanted to leave Real Madrid, but he had the misfortune to be an excellent but relatively functional player at a time when the club needed to raise money to pay for more glamorous recruits. He was sold in the same summer of 2000 that Florentino Perez pulled off the great and extremely expensive Luis Figo heist from Barcelona, and the £11m that Milan paid for Redondo came in very handy to balance the books. Still, he could have been perfect in Italy, but ruptured his cruciate knee ligaments in an early training session for Milan, didn't play for two years and finally admitted defeat in 2004 when he retired at 35.
3) Robbie Keane at Liverpool
While the obvious jokes about how many boyhood clubs Keane had upon signing for new clubs are amusing, there is something undeniably romantic about a player signing for a club close to their heart. It should have worked too but, according to Steven Gerrard, Benitez bought Keane for around £20m from Tottenham and then immediately started trying to change his game, which seems an odd strategy for a striker who already had 170 goals to his name. Keane was at Liverpool for the first half of the 2008-09 season, when they finished four points behind Manchester United for the title, before returning to Tottenham. Could his goals, used properly, have tipped the balance? We'll never know.
2) Juan Sebastian Veron at Man United
In some respects, it's surprising that Ferguson even signed Veron: here was a manager who was a pragmatist, taking a £28.1m punt on a brilliant midfielder who quite obviously didn't really fit into his team. Ferguson occasionally couldn't resist a little romantic gamble, and while it paid off with Eric Cantona, it didn't with Veron, who spent two fruitless seasons with United. The club were ultimately lucky to get half of their money back because new Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich came along with £15m in 2003, though the Argentine ended up playing only seven times in the Premier League before being loaned to Inter and Estudiantes. United have had a few expensive failures over the years, but Veron combining with Paul Scholes, spreading passes out wide to David Beckham and Ryan Giggs, slipping through balls to Ruud van Nistelrooy would have seen their dominance extended for a few more seasons at least and could have landed them another Champions League trophy.
1) Mario Balotelli at Liverpool
None of Balotelli's transfers have really worked out. After three years at both Inter Milan and Man City, two years on the red side of Milan followed, before a £16m transfer to Liverpool in 2014. Most of the Italian striker's moves at least started with a bit of hope, but not this one. Manager Brendan Rodgers made it pretty clear from the start that Balotelli was basically a gamble because they couldn't get anyone else to replace Luis Suarez -- his first choice being Alexis Sanchez, who chose Arsenal instead. Four goals in 28 games ensured Balotelli was back on loan at Milan within a year, then on to Nice where it seemed briefly as if he had found somewhere relatively low-key to fulfil his potential. He never really has, but what a story it would have been had he succeeded at Anfield. It would have defied all logic, sense and conventional tactics, but it would have been fun.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ruben Neves shares joy over Wolves switch</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Since arriving from Porto in the summer of 2017, the Portuguese has stunned supporters with a series of outrageous strikes.
Having won the Championship and helped Wolves become a Premier League and Europa League force, the 23-year-old has no regrets – initially swapping the Champions League for English football’s second tier.
“It was a tough decision because I was a Porto player, I was in my country and I was playing in the Champions League,” Neves told Sky Sports.
“But in my last season with Porto, I didn’t play so much, so I needed to think about myself and my career.
“When I spoke with Wolves, I really liked the project, the ambition.
“Fortunately, it’s turned into one of the best decisions I have made in my career.”
One of the major selling points to Neves at the time was boss Nuno Espirito Santo, who he had worked with at Porto.
And Neves has gone on to play an integral role in Wolves’ success under Nuno.
“He was a big factor. Nuno was my last coach at Porto, and then he called me to say that he wanted me to go with him,” said Neves.
The midfielder – currently back with his family in Portugal while football is suspended because of Covid-19 – also gave an insight into Nuno’s managerial approach as he added: “He’s a really relaxed person who doesn’t speak too much outside of the pitch.
“He just likes to rest and spend time with his family.
“He’s always thinking of tomorrow and what he can do to help the team.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man Utd's Ravel Morrison was better than Paul Pogba 'by a mile' says Wayne Rooney</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Wayne Rooney reckons Ravel Morrison was 'better than Paul Pogba by a country mile' during their days in Manchester United's youth ranks.
Former United star Rooney has recalled how he once saw a young Morrison nutmeg imperious defender Nemanja Vidic three times in a minute in training.
But the 34-year-old says the difference in the two players' career trajectories since then shows that talent will only get you so far - with hard work crucial to success, too.
Pogba left United for Juventus, but was brought back to Old Trafford for a world record £89million following a trophy-laden spell in Turin.
Although he has been injured for most of this season, the World Cup winner is being courted by Real Madrid, PSG and his old club Juve.
Morrison, meanwhile, is on loan at Middlesbrough from Sheffield United - the 11th club of the 27-year-old's career.
"I remember watching Ravel Morrison thinking he had everything required for a player in his position," Rooney wrote in his Sunday Times column.
"He nutmegged Nemanja Vidic three times in the space of a minute in one training game.
"But he struggled with lifestyle and his environment which was sad for him - because I saw Paul Pogba come through, Jesse Lingard, all these players and Ravel was better than any of them by a country mile.
"He's proof that you can't escape the fact there are guidelines every player has to obey in professional football.
"Then you think how far you can go by being ultra-professional. Gary Neville, for instance. Gary's not a great football player but he worked in every minute of every training session and made the most of everything he had.
"Sir Alex Ferguson used to say the hardest thing in life is to work hard every day. Forget all your ability, strip everything back: if you can work hard every day, in whatever job you do you'll be successful."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Alexander Hleb: I cried over Arsenal exit; most players regret leaving</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
Alexander Hleb might not be the first name that springs to mind when you think of the 2006 Arsenal team which came so close to winning the first Champions League trophy in club’s history.
But it was Arsenal where the versatile Belarusian midfielder played the best football in his career – and eventually earned himself a £12million move to Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona in the summer of 2008.
Yet what would be a dream move for most players turned out to be an utter disaster for Hleb, who spent just one year at Barcelona before leaving loan to Stuttgart and never returning to Spain.
“It’s still difficult for me to explain why I left Arsenal,” Hleb says. “I was absolutely happy there. Arsene completely trusted me, it was idyllic. And then I decided to leave.
“I was on vacation and agents and managers convinced me that I had to go to Barcelona. To be honest, I didn’t really understand what I was doing. At some point, I realised, ‘Oh god! I’m leaving Arsenal!’
“When Arsene said that it was a matter of hours, I felt devastated. It was really hard for me to accept that. Wenger did everything to make me stay at Arsenal.
“He even texted me as I was fishing. ‘Alex, I won’t let you go, we need you here.’ I cried when I read it.”
Hleb reckons he is one of many players who’ve regretted leaving Arsenal and Wenger behind over the years, but his relationship with the Gunners boss survived the transfer.
“Yes, we even met in Minsk a few months ago when Arsenal played against BATE in the Champions League,” Hleb says. “Wenger is like a father to me. It was really easy to work with him, you always felt his support.
“During my first season in England, I picked up in injury while playing for the national team. So, as I was trying to recover from it, I told Arsene that maybe it would make sense to send me on loan to Germany or something.
“He was like, ‘Stop it! I believe in you! Don’t even think about things like that.’ Honestly? I just flew out of the room. It really felt like I had wings.
“Arsene truly feels his players. He says exactly what a player needs to hear. I think there are very few guys who might say that they haven’t enjoyed working with him. Everyone felt like they would get a chance. And I think most players who left ultimately regretted it.”
Hleb moved from Stuttgart to Arsenal in 2005, a year after the Invincibles wrote their way into Premier League folklore.
It would have been hard for anyone to get into a starting XI featuring players like Thierry Henry, Robert Pires and Dennis Bergkamp, but a 24-year-old Belarusian who didn’t have any Premier League experience and couldn’t understand a word of English? Imagine that.
“When I first came to London, the first team was still on vacation because they finished the season a bit later than I did in Germany,” Hleb says. “So, during my first days at Arsenal, I was mainly surrounded by youngsters.
“Everything was great although I got really upset when I found out that Patrick Vieira was leaving. I mean, I just came there and one of the greats was already on his way out.
“Then the first team came in, but I couldn’t speak to anyone because I didn’t know English! And all the main guys spoke either English or French. The only two players I could really chat with were Jens Lehmann who obviously spoke German and Philippe Senderos who spoke six languages.
“Then the club gave me a teacher and it all worked out well, but I definitely had to train very hard because Premier League football was extremely intensive, much more intensive than it was in Bundesliga.
“We played one-touch football and you had to make a decision before you even got the ball. You need time to adapt to that. Fortunately, I had Arsene who really believed in me so after six months or so I felt completely settled and ready to go.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Willian reveals his most 'annoying' teammate at Chelsea</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Willian admits Diego Costa was ‘really annoying’ to play against at Chelsea but claims Eden Hazard has been his funniest teammate at Stamford Bridge.
Costa spent three seasons at Chelsea after he was signed in a £32 million deal from Atletico Madrid in 2014.
The Brazil-born Spain international won two Premier League titles during his time at Stamford Bridge and scored 59 goals in 120 appearances.
Costa is well-known for his combative playing style and Willian admits the former Chelsea striker was a nightmare to come up against.
‘A great guy, on the pitch that’s how he behaves, he annoys every defender,’ Willian said in an interview with Brazillian YouTube channel ‘Desimpedidos’.
‘He is the striker that no defender wants to face.
‘He really is annoying. He makes a whole mess, gets the defenders a few yellow cards and after that they get scared of making a mistake and get the red card.
‘So he really is the striker that the defender does not want to play against because of his many qualities.
‘I played against him once I think in a Champions League semi-final. The year I arrived at Chelsea, we reached the semi-finals against Atletico but thank god after that we only played together.’
Willian also named Hazard as his funniest teammate and revealed that the former Chelsea winger consoled him after Belgium knocked out Brazil in the 2018 World Cup.
‘He is fantastic. He could be Brazillian,’ said Willian.
‘He jokes around a lot, has the Brazilian style, likes to laugh, talk. Besides being a great player, he is also a friend I made after all those years.
‘After the game he came to our locker room and said our team was very good and that sadly they won that day.
‘He said they were very tired from running after us and that we had a bit of bad luck, that they studied our team very well, our strengths, what each and one of them had to do on the pitch.
‘Tactically, they really were very well-prepared to face us.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Suresh Raina will make a comeback in Team India, has lot of cricket left in him: Ambati Rayudu</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chennai Super Kings (CSK) batsman Ambati Rayudu has said that he was confident that his teammate Suresh Raina would make a comeback in Team India.
Talking to sports writer and presenter Rupha Ramani on CSK's Instagram Live session, the batsman said Suresh Raina looked in really good shape and it was unfortunate that IPL had to be postponed due to coronavirus pandemic.
Rayudu called Raina a star cricketer and opined that he did not get enough opportunity to bat in the top-order for India.
"He has a lot of cricket left in him..I am putting a bet on it that he would make a comeback for India."
Rayudu added that he had a good time training with Raina in the CSK training camp and the experience was quite nostalgic for him as he has known Raina since he was 16.
Ambati Rayudu was also asked about the difference in captaincy of MS Dhoni and Rohit Sharma. The Hyderabad-batsman said Rohit Sharma has learnt about captaincy from MS Dhoni.
"Dhoni has been captain for all of us including MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli and so what ever Rohit is becoming is because of MS Dhoni. He has learnt a lot from him, there won't be much difference but I think he is going in the right direction. Long way to go for him and to achieve the success of Dhoni but I am sure he will get there," Rayudu said.
Ambati Rayudu also reflected on the difference in the set-up of Mumbai Indians (MI) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK). He said there were lots of differences and he feels more comfortable at CSK. He added that CSK will be his favourite team even after he retires from cricket.
Ambati Rayudu admitted that he got more batting cances at CSK that he got at MI. He said CSK also him to opening the innings and it was good for him though he hasn't minded batting at any position since his early days.
"At CSK it's pretty calm, they have lot more faith in players ability, while MI is more 'play-your-role' kind of a set up."
Rayudu also talked highly of CSK fanbase and said even practice sessions witness 10,000 fans at the stadium. He said that such fanbase is only common with football teams.
"CSK fans are emotional like how south Indians are, they have knowledge. Even when playing for India we don't see such fan base," Ambati Rayudu concluded.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rohit Sharma on the toughest bowlers he has faced, winning World Cups for fans and more</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The thought of standing up to Brett Lee’s thunderbolts gave him sleepless nights when he first toured Australia while the pace and swing generated by Dale Steyn was also a big challenge, said Indian cricket star Rohit Sharma.
Among the current lot of bowlers, Josh Hazlewood is one speedster Rohit doesn’t enjoy facing in Tests. The white-ball format vice captain said he will have to be mentally prepared to face Hazlewood when (and if) India tour Australia for a Test series later this year.
Told Rohit he will rule Indian cricket, good on Dhoni that he backed him: Gambhir
Asked to name the toughest pacers he has faced so far, Rohit said, “One bowler is Brett Lee because he didn’t let me sleep the previous night on my first tour to Australia in 2007, as I was thinking how to play this bowler who bowls in excess of 150 kmph.”
“In 2007, Brett Lee was at his peak. I used to watch him closely and noticed that he was consistently bowling at the speed of around 150-155 kmph. The thought of a youngster like me facing that kind of speed took away my sleep,” Rohit said of the former Australian pacer on Star Sports’ ‘Cricket Connected’.
Rohit said South African pace great Dale Steyn has also given him nightmares because of his ability to swing the ball at great speed.
“I have two retired favourite bowlers who I never wanted to face, one was Brett Lee and the other was Dale Steyn. I never wanted to face Steyn because playing pace and swing at the same time was a nightmare, it was just unreal.”
Since making his debut in 2007 as a precocious talent, Rohit has gone on to become one of the world’s most prolific batsmen, and is famed for his exploits in limited overs cricket as an opener. He has racked up 29 ODI hundreds and six centuries in Test cricket, besides four three-figure mark in the T20 Internationals.
“Currently, someone whom I don’t want to face in Test cricket would be Josh Hazlewood because he’s disciplined and does not move away from that length. He does not give you loose balls,” he said.
“I have watched him enough to understand that. I know for a fact that if I have to go to Australia to play a Test, then I have to be mentally prepared to be disciplined while facing Josh,” said the scorer of three double hundreds in ODIs.

Saying he is not lucky as the Australians to have a house with a backyard where he can have a hit, Rohit said he is managing to get some physical training done in the balcony of his apartment in Mumbai.
“I missing hitting the ball, because you know I like hitting them big and so this space is not enough. I just can’t wait to go out there and start hitting balls again,” Rohit added.
Speaking about the importance of fans in Indian cricket, Rohit hoped to give them moments to cherish soon.
“In the next few years there are three different World cups, hopefully we can win maybe two of them... or why not, all three and give the fans moments worth cherishing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Karun Nair, Ambati Rayudu and moving on from Ashwin, Jadeja: MSK Prasad lists his biggest regrets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former chairman of the India cricket team selection committee MSK Prasad threw some light on some decisions around team selection in a recent interview, saying the three biggest regrets he has over his tenure are not giving enough chances to Karun Nair, not playing Ambati Rayudu in the 2019 World Cup and moving on from Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in the shorter-formats after the 2017 Champions Trophy.
“Karun Nair, even after getting that triple century, we didn’t give many opportunties. We could’ve given him that comeback opportunity. We did give him the England series but he didn’t get a match to play, but someone who scores 300, this happens very rarely in world cricket. That was heart-breaking, not only for him, for all of us,” Prasad said on Fancode.
“I also feel bad for Ambati Rayudu, he was in the thick of things till the last second before the World Cup and on the day of the selections, he was missed out. There’s no doubt that it’s not only he who felt bad for it, I am sure all of the selectors felt bad,” he said.
MSK Prasad then said that the decision to move on from Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja after the Champions Trophy has “paid rich dividends” but that he feels bad about it because Jadeja and Ashwin were two of the best spinners in the world then.
“After the Champions Trophy, we had to move on from Ravindra Jadeja and Ashwin and we brought in Kuldeep and Chahal. It’s a wonderful move that paid rich dividends for us for the next couple of years, but let’s not forget that they were no.1 and no.2 Test cricketers when they were left out of the ODI side,” he said.
Jadeja has made it back into the limited-overs teams since then, but Ashwin has grown to be seen as a specialist Test cricketer.
Asked to speak on MS Dhoni, Prasad said that the former India captain had said that he did not want to play for some time and so the team moved on from him. He said Dhoni’s IPL performance would have been something to look out for but the postponement of the tournament poses a “tricky situation”.
“We had a discussion and Dhoni didn’t want to play for sometime, so we moved on and then picked Rishabh Pant and we’ve been backing him… It would’ve been nice had this IPL been held and we would’ve seen Mahi’s old glimpses back but now it’s a tricky situation,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Had a good chance to maybe make 200: Rohit Sharma on Indore T20I ton</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MUMBAI: Rohit Sharma said that he may have missed out on an opportunity to score a T20I double hundred when he got out during the 2017 Indore T20I against Sri Lanka.
India's limited-overs deputy said this during a live online interaction with fans of his Indian Premier League side Mumbai Indians, clips of which were tweeted by the IPL champions.
Rohit scored the joint fastest T20I hundred in December 2017 when he reached the three-figure mark in just 35 balls. His innings was part of a whirlwind opening stand of 165 with KL Rahul and he was eventually dismissed on 118 off 43 balls in the 13th over.

In the live interaction that was organised by the IPL champions, a fan reminded Rohit of the knock. "In that game I had a good chance to maybe make 200 also. When I got out there were still more than 9 overs (seven) left. So it was a good chance but fine, 35-ball 100 -- I will take that," said the MI captain.
Rohit also answered numerous non-cricket questions from the fans. He said that it is his wife Ritika Sajdeh who remembers important dates more than him and revealed that he liked Maths a lot in his school days.
"I used to love doing calculations -- addition, subtraction. I used to love geometry and algebra also. Although it was very tough I used to love theorems and all that," he said.
He also said that he liked Chandler the most from the popular television show 'Friends.' "I love Chandler the most. I love his expressions more than his quotes," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Promised coach Kumble that I would pick a five-fer on debut, reveals Kuldeep Yadav</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Kuldeep Yadav made his Test debut for India back in 2017, there was considerable hype around the youngster, given he, by then, had already made inroads in both the IPL and the domestic circuit. Thus with the series on the line and team India without the services of skipper Virat Kohli, coach Anil Kumble decided to take a punt and hand Kuldeep a debut on a turning Dharamsala wicket, playing him as the third spinner in the team alongside Ashwin and Jadeja.
Speaking to Cricbuzz, the left-arm wrist-spinner revealed that a day before the game, coach Kumble had asked Kuldeep to pick a five-wicket haul in the game, to which the spinner replied and promised that he would do so. Eventually, he ended up picking four wickets in the first innings but that was enough as India ended up winning the game by 8 wickets to seal a series win.
"Anil sir said to me, you will play tomorrow and you have to take 5 wickets. So, for a minute I just froze. Then I said, yes sir, I will take 5 wickets,” Kuldeep told Cricbuzz.
“During lunch, while eating, I kept thinking how will I get David Warner out. Then I planned for it: that I will first bowl 3-4 normal flights. He will come forward to play them. Then I will bowl a flipper and maybe he will shift to the back foot and be caught behind or bowled. That's exactly what happened."
While 2019 was a year to forget for Kuldeep, he still provided the Indian fans with a moment of magic in the World Cup, where he bamboozled Pakistan’s Babar Azam with an outrageous delivery. Kuldeep expressed his disbelief about the delivery and stated that he was still not sure how he managed to do what he did.
"That was something different. A spinner's ball drifted that way and went through. then it hit. And turned to come inside. Sometimes you wonder how you did that. That too a white ball, not a red one. A white ball doesn't even turn much," Kuldeep said about the delivery to Azam.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Current situation is an amazing opportunity to fix Australia’s domestic cricket setups, says Langer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australia coach Justin Langer is looking at the extended break in cricket due to the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to fix the issues that have seeped into the country’s once thriving state and club level setups.
There was a time when the country would field an ‘A’ squad alongside its main team for an annual limited overs triangular series in the Australian summer.
“It wasn’t that long ago that we prided ourselves on having an amazing club cricket system that fed into state domestic cricket, which fed into the best of the best playing for Australia,” Langer told ABC Grandstand on Fox Sports.
“I see it [the current situation] as an amazing opportunity. I can see it [domestic cricket setup] actually going back that way.
“More emphasis back on club cricket, more emphasis on state cricket then get the best of the best in Australia. That would be my vision for the next five years,” the former opener, who payed at a time when Australia were a dominant force in world cricket, added.
Under normal circumstances, the Australian players would have assembled in Brisbane before flying to Bangladesh for a two-match Test series. But like all other sporting engagements, the pandemic has also led to the postponement of that tour.
“We’ve got to make sure they’re all in tip-top condition. I actually can’t wait to see how they come back without all the bells and whistles... it’s going to be a really good indication of the hungry, self-resilient and self-reliant players,” the coach said.
Under Langer’s guidance, Australia recently grabbed the number one position in Tests at the expense of India.
Langer has been regularly offering feedback during Cricket Australia chief executive Kevin Roberts’ discussions with staff, while also staying in touch with players and helping them with his advice amid this pandemic.
“We’ve got to keep moving the ship in the right direction ... our guys come back off their leave on May 18.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Justin Langer sees an opportunity to fix Australia’s domestic setups, CA secures loan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australia coach Justin Langer is looking at the Covid-19pandemic as “an amazing opportunity” to fix the issues that have seeped into the country’s once-thriving state and club level setups.
There was a time when the country would field an ‘A’ squad alongside its main team for an annual limited-overs triangular series in the Australian summer.
“It wasn’t that long ago that we prided ourselves on having an amazing club cricket system that fed into state domestic cricket, which fed into the best of the best playing for Australia,” Langer told ABC Grandstand on Fox Sports.
“I see it (the current situation) as an amazing opportunity. I can see it (domestic cricket setup) actually going back that way.
“More emphasis back on club cricket, more emphasis on state cricket then get the best of the best in Australia. That would be my vision for the next five years,” the former opener, who played at a time when Australia were a dominant force in world cricket, added.
Under normal circumstances, the Australian players would have assembled in Brisbane before flying to Bangladesh for a two-match Test series.
But like all other sporting engagements, the pandemic has also led to the postponement of that tour.
“We’ve got to make sure they’re all in tip-top condition. I actually can’t wait to see how they come back without all the bells and whistles… it’s going to be a really good indication of the hungry, self-resilient and self-reliant players,” the coach said.
Under Langer’s guidance, Australia recently grabbed the number one position in Tests at the expense of India.
Langer has been regularly offering feedback during Cricket Australia chief executive Kevin Roberts’ discussions with staff, while also staying in touch with players and helping them with his advice amid this pandemic.
“We’ve got to keep moving the ship in the right direction … our guys come back off their leave on May 18.”
Cricket Australia has secured a loan of USD 50 million, an upfront payment as part of a larger USD 200 million credit, which it has sought to cover the losses if India fail to tour the country later this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
According to a report published in The Sydney Morning Herald, stakeholders have been informed that the loan with the Commonwealth Bank is a “done deal”.
However, it raised fresh questions about the governing body’s decision to stand down 80 percent of its staff last month due to financial crisis.
CA stood down more than 200 staff on 20 percent pay until the end of June with chief executive Kevin Roberts fearing they might run out of money by August if the drastic cuts were not made.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Pakistan bowler says players underperformed in 2009 in a ‘conspiracy’ against captain Younis Khan - Report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Pakistan fast bowler Rana Navd-ul-Hasan has reportedly revealed that some of the team’s players underperformed deliberately in the ODI series against New Zealand in the UAE back in 2009. According to a report in Cricket Pakistan, Rana told a Pakistani news channel that the players did not give their best on the field as they were not comfortable playing under then skipper Younis Khan.
“We lost two ODI matches against New Zealand in UAE during 2009 because some of the players involved deliberately did not play well, and I sat out that tour,” Naved said.

He further explained that he dropped out of the tour because he had already told Younis Khan that there is a “conspiracy” against him. “I did not play because I had told Younis Khan that this was the conspiracy against you and that I am also a part of that plot,” he said.
Naved added that Younis had changed after he was given the captaincy role, and there were some senior members of the team who involved him in the affair to further their aims. “This was not a rebellion against Younis Khan. He was a good cricketer and I did play alongside him so there were no issues except that when he became captain, he became a different person,” he said.
“Some seniors, and I won’t name names as they may have had aspirations of being captains themselves, got us involved in this whole affair as well to further their aims. We were about seven to eight people involved in this,” he added.
Naved further added that there were some big names of Pakistan cricket who were involved in the whole scheme. “We were all called into a room and an oath of allegiance taken and the people in that room were some big names of Pakistan cricket. If I mention those names, then they will get angry with me,” he said.

“They said we don’t want him to be removed but we would like the PCB Chairman to reason with Younis Khan as he does not take the advice of seniors as captain and does what he feels likes doing,” he added.
“I went along with this thinking that if this is the only matter and the PCB Chairman tells him that, then I don’t have an issue with this,” he further said.
Pakistan suffered a 2-1 defeat in the three-match ODI series, despite winning the first game by 138 runs. They lost the 2nd match by 64 runs and then suffered a 7-run defeat in the third ODI.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Senior Pakistan players under-performed during 2009 New Zealand series: Rana Naved</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KARACHI: Former Pakistan pacer Rana Naved ul Hassan has alleged that a number of senior players "deliberately under-performed" during the 2009 ODI series against New Zealand in the UAE as they were unhappy with Younis Khan's captaincy.
The 42-year-old Rana, who played 9 Tests, 74 ODIs and 4 T20Is for Pakistan, specifically spoke about two ODIs during that tour.
"We lost two ODI matches against New Zealand in the UAE during 2009 because some of the players involved deliberately did not play well," Rana told a local news channel.
The pacer also claimed he pulled out of the tour because he didn't want to be a part of the conspiracy by seniors against the skipper.

It was after the 2009 Champions Trophy in South Africa where some players gathered together and reportedly vowed to oust Younis as they felt he was too "arrogant and abusive".
"I preferred to sit out of the tour. But I had informed Younis Khan that this was a conspiracy against you and that they wanted me to be part of it," he said.
Rana, however, maintained that it was not a rebellion against Younis, the person but Younis as captain.
"After he (Younis) became captain, his personality and attitude changed and some seniors (he didn't name them), who harboured ambitions of leading the side didn't want to play under him."
The senior players during that phase were Mohammed Yousuf, Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal and Saeed Ajmal.
Pakistan lost the three-match ODI series, 1-2 despite winning the first match in a convincing fashion by 138 runs. They lost the remaining two matches by 64 and seven runs, respectively.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pakistan players deliberately played badly in conspiracy against Younis Khan’s captaincy: Rana Naved</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Pakistan cricket Rana Naved-ul-Hasan has revealed that many players in the team, including some “big names of Pakistani cricket” were in a “conspiracy” against captain Younis Khan in 2009.
Speaking about a series against New Zealand in 2009 on a local television channel, Naved said, “We lost two ODI matches against New Zealand in UAE during 2009 because some of the players involved deliberately did not play well. I sat out that tour. I did not play because I had told Younis Khan that this was the conspiracy against you and that I am also a part of that plot,” as quoted by Cricket Pakistan.

“This was not a rebellion against Younis Khan. He was a good cricketer, there were no issues except that when he became captain, he became a different person,” he said.
Saying that he will not take names of the players involved, Naved revealed that the players took an oath of allegiance once, saying that they wanted the PCB chairman to reason with Younis Khan. “They said we don’t want him to be removed but we would like the PCB Chairman to reason with Younis Khan as he does not take advice of seniors as captain and does what he feel likes doing,” said Naved.
Naved played nine Tests and picked 18 wickets at an average of 58, but had a more successful ODI career, claiming 110 wickets in 74 ODIs at an average of 29.28 and an economy rate of 5.57. He played his last match for Pakistan in February 2010.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sylvia's Memory recalled with quiet confidence after 15 months</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's not often one destroys the opposition on debut, and by her third start was competing against a soon-to-be star sprinter and dual Group 1 winner, but that's the early memory for a three-year-old filly having her first run in nearly 15 months at Monday's feature Grafton meeting.
Sylvia's Memory from the Marc Quinn yard at Port Macquarie hasn't started since early February 2019 when she finished down the track behind Bivouac and Cosmic Force as a two-year-old in the Listed Lonhro Stakes at Warwick Farm.
That came only a few weeks after she exploded on the scene with a dominant 800m maiden win at Coffs Harbour, ironically thrashing Gosford filly Divine Approach who she meets again in this Class 1 Handicap over 1015m.
Talk about the swings and roundabouts of racing. Sylvia's Memory was sidelined for about a year before finally returning with a clean bill of health at the trials a month ago and has been taken along quietly since.
Conversely, Divine Approach who resumes off a more routine spell for the Tony Newing stable, went on to have three more runs in the autumn of 2019 against some of the better two-year-olds before returning for a consistent spring campaign, never missing a place and landing her maiden fourth-up as a hot favourite at Dubbo.
For punters, it's an intriguing recipe, even before you throw in well-performed Far North Coast mare Unimpeded in what looms as a potentially strong form reference.
Meanwhile, in one of the most open BM 66 Handicap (1620m) seen in a long while, an unlikely six-year-old who opened at better than 50/1 in early markets can shock a stack of seemingly better-credentialed runners.
Kempsey-based I've Got This made up a stack of late ground third-up in similar company, and with a little drop in weight, better draw and stepping beyond the mile, he can charge home and shake the life out of a race that is an exotic punter's paradise.
At shorter odds, although still great value in a wide market, progressive four-year-old Coffs gelding Galway also looks primed fourth-up after hitting the line hard in consecutive BM 58s, and generally improves further getting back on top of the ground.
And in what looms as a two-horse war in the feature Bushgrove Cup (1215m) to close the card, track specialist Exclusive, with four of his five wins at Grafton, locks horns with early favourite Magnalane fresh off a smart trial win and a terrific closing run in the Country Championship final at Randwick a month back.

Conversely, Divine Approach who resumes off a more routine spell for the Tony Newing stable, went on to have three more runs in the autumn of 2019 against some of the better two-year-olds before returning for a consistent spring campaign, never missing a place and landing her maiden fourth-up as a hot favourite at Dubbo.
For punters, it's an intriguing recipe, even before you throw in well-performed Far North Coast mare Unimpeded in what looms as a potentially strong form reference.
Meanwhile, in one of the most open BM 66 Handicap (1620m) seen in a long while, an unlikely six-year-old who opened at better than 50/1 in early markets can shock a stack of seemingly better-credentialed runners.
Kempsey-based I've Got This made up a stack of late ground third-up in similar company, and with a little drop in weight, better draw and stepping beyond the mile, he can charge home and shake the life out of a race that is an exotic punter's paradise.
At shorter odds, although still great value in a wide market, progressive four-year-old Coffs gelding Galway also looks primed fourth-up after hitting the line hard in consecutive BM 58s, and generally improves further getting back on top of the ground.
And in what looms as a two-horse war in the feature Bushgrove Cup (1215m) to close the card, track specialist Exclusive, with four of his five wins at Grafton, locks horns with early favourite Magnalane fresh off a smart trial win and a terrific closing run in the Country Championship final at Randwick a month back.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sylvia's Memory recalled with quiet confidence after 15 months</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's not often one destroys the opposition on debut, and by her third start was competing against a soon-to-be star sprinter and dual Group 1 winner, but that's the early memory for a three-year-old filly having her first run in nearly 15 months at Monday's feature Grafton meeting.
Sylvia's Memory from the Marc Quinn yard at Port Macquarie hasn't started since early February 2019 when she finished down the track behind Bivouac and Cosmic Force as a two-year-old in the Listed Lonhro Stakes at Warwick Farm.
That came only a few weeks after she exploded on the scene with a dominant 800m maiden win at Coffs Harbour, ironically thrashing Gosford filly Divine Approach who she meets again in this Class 1 Handicap over 1015m.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AFL biased toward Victorian clubs, says Rockliff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Port Adelaide midfielder Tom Rockliff says the AFL is biased toward Victorian teams after the league's ruling to prevent certain clubs resuming group training.
The Western Australian government has lifted the local limit on outdoor gatherings to 10 people with the state's COVID-19 cases declining.
The ruling in WA matches that of South Australia and would have allowed teams in those states to expand their training groups as the AFL moves towards restarting the postponed season.
Gold Coast chief executive Mark Evans has confirmed the two Queensland clubs - the Suns and Brisbane Lions - could also ramp up training if given approval by the AFL after the state government on Friday eased restrictions.
But the AFL quickly stepped in to ensure the 10 Victorian clubs, along with Sydney and GWS, were not disadvantaged by different restrictions in different states, stressing all 18 teams must abide by initial rules where players can only train with one other person.
While Rockliff – who captained Brisbane and has spent his entire 191-game career outside of Victoria – could understand the AFL's predicament, he was still frustrated by the stance.
"I sort of get where the AFL's coming from. They wanted to go with Scott Morrison's advice and the federal government," Rockliff told ABC Radio.
"The ability for us to train in groups would have been handy but as we know the AFL makes the rules and it's generally got a bias towards Victorian teams, and that's just the way it goes.
"It's something we have to adjust to but I sort of understand it in this scenario."
Greater Western Sydney's Phil Davis could see both sides of the argument, but was not in favour of restricting training for players of teams based in states that are easing lockdown rules.
"I see both sides of it, in the sense that, to an extent there is a competitive advantage to being able to train in [groups of] 10," he told ABC Grandstand.
"You know, training in twos at the moment is extremely difficult, [we're] working quite hard to stay fit. It makes footy drills a bit harder, motivation can be a bit harder as well, not being [together] in that sense.
"I'm also of the belief that if they're allowed to, let them go, because if that's the difference between me winning and losing a game in a month or so's time, or two months' time, I'd be pretty disappointed, as an elite athlete.
"And I'm also a bit of the view that if someone else has a freedom, you shouldn't take it away from them just because someone else doesn't have it.
"I see the argument from both sides. I see that there is an advantage, but I also see that, if that's the difference between me winning or losing, I'd be pretty disappointed in myself."
Port Adelaide football boss Chris Davies disagreed with his midfielder, saying the AFL's equalisation move is fair in the current climate of uncertainty.
"We have the potential to be able to train with more than two people, but we're also going into a period now where there's 15 to 17 of our guys who are going to have to quarantine for two weeks," he told ABC Radio.
"It's really important from here that everyone gets an opportunity to have some form of level playing field."
West Coast chief executive Trevor Nisbett is expecting the AFL to soon revisit the rules surrounding group training.
"At the moment, we can have our players around in groups of 10, by law, but protocols from the AFL are you can only do it in pairs," he said.
"That will change very rapidly and hopefully we'll be able to at least start training with groups of 10 and then a few weeks down the track we may be able to get a full group of guys training together."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NFL isn’t planning on adjusting its 2020 schedule amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report.
With its schedule set for release next week, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that the regular season is expected to start as planned on Sept. 10, and the Super Bowl in Tampa Bay is still set for Feb. 7, ESPN reported.
"We plan to start on time," McCarthy said.
CAM NEWTON WILL NOT ACCEPT JOB AS BACKUP QB, REPORT SAYS
ESPN said that the league has looked into alternative plans, including working with the NFL Players Association and medical professionals to establish protocols, if the coronavirus outbreak were to continue.
The Sports Business Journal reported last Monday that possible contingencies discussed by the league included delaying the start of the season until Oct. 15 and moving the Super Bowl back to Feb. 28. Last month, the Washington Post reported that the league was looking into playing games in empty or partially filled stadiums.
The NFL Network reported on March 31 that the league has planned to release the schedule no later than May 9. So far, the NFL has adjusted some of its offseason activities because of the coronavirus. One of the first activities was the NFL Draft, which took place virtually with coaches and executives from all 32 teams operating from their homes.

The league and players association agreed to a voluntary virtual offseason program ending no later than May 15 since team facilities have been closed.
There have not yet been any changes to the preseason schedule, with the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers still on track to play the Hall of Fame Game on Aug. 6.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NFL: League on track for full season starting on September 10</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - The National Football League (NFL), the only major American sporting league so far largely unaffected by the coronavirus outbreak, says it is on course to begin its season on time in September.
“We plan announcing late next week the full regular season schedule that begins with Kickoff on September 10 and culminates with the Super Bowl in Tampa February 7, 2021,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in an email to Reuters.
Each team is expected to play 16 regular season games as per usual, though the league is evaluating contingency plans should this prove untenable, multiple media outlets have reported.
It is yet to be announced whether fans will be allowed to attend games.
While other major sporting leagues, including the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Major League Baseball (MLB), have shut down due to the coronavirus, the NFL has been able to buy time before making any major decisions.
Its season ended in early February, shortly before evidence of a major coronavirus outbreak in the United States became widely known.
Some areas of the U.S. are now starting to emerge from lockdown as rules are relaxed even as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases rises in some states.
Last week’s NFL draft attracted record U.S. television ratings in a country starved of live sporting action.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NBA News: League Could Delay Start Of New Season To December In Order To Bring In Fans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Danny Cox
Even though they haven’t yet finished their current year of play, the NBA is already looking at possibly delaying the start of next season.
The coronavirus pandemic has brought a halt to virtually all professional and amateur sports around the world. Nearly two months ago, the NBA was the first professional league to suspend its season after canceling a couple of games on March 11.
With no real way of knowing if the current season will resume and achieve completion, eyes are already looking ahead to 2020. ESPN is reporting that commissioner Adam Silver and the NBA board of governors are discussing a delayed start to the 2020-21 season, which wouldn’t have it begin until December.
The regular season for the NBA typically begins in October each year.
The main idea behind a possible delay of the start of next season would be to have more time to get fans in the seats. Governors around the country are looking at allowing professional sports to resume soon, but they would still have to play games with little to no fans in attendance.
The NBA feels as if they could have fans back in arenas and not lose additional revenue with the granting of extra time before next season. Not everyone on the board of governors feels as if fans would return by the end of the year.
One member told ESPN, “If you start in December, that doesn’t mean the people are coming back in December, but maybe, they’re back by March.”
Discussions will be ongoing, with no decision officially made for the start of the 2020 season. On Friday, the NBA board of governors did vote to postpone the draft lottery and draft combine, which were both slated for May dates in Chicago.
The 2020 NBA Draft is still on track to take place on June 25, but postponement is not out of the question. A final decision won’t be made on the draft until a bit more time passes. If things continue on this path, another vote would also be needed.
If the current NBA season does resume and doesn’t end until early fall, the next season would have to be delayed or even shortened.
On Saturday, the NFL announced they would release a full 17-game schedule next week. Commissioner Roger Goodell says there is no intention of delaying or altering any plans for the 2020 regular season. No changes will take place unless the coronavirus pandemic worsens in the coming months.

The NBA is mulling the idea of pushing the start of the 2020-21 season until December as the coronavirus pandemic continues to impede the league’s ability to finish out the current season, reports say.
Commissioner Adam Silver and the NBA board of governors met Friday to address a number of concerns regarding how to proceed after the season was suspended on March 11. Among the plans discussed was the possibility of pushing the start of the 2020-21 season until December, ESPN reported, citing league sources.
NBA PUSHES BACK DRAFT COMBINE, DRAFT LOTTERY
"If you start in December, that doesn't mean the people are coming back in December, but maybe they're back by March," one member of the board told ESPN.
If the plan is carried out, the season would reportedly begin just before Christmas and run into late July or early August.
The league also decided Friday to delay the draft lottery and draft combine, events scheduled for Chicago later this month.
The lottery cannot occur until the regular season is completed or is declared over, because team records determine the odds that the 14 non-playoff teams will have of securing the right to pick No. 1 overall in the draft.

For now, the draft remains scheduled for June 25 — though that, too, will likely have to change in the coming weeks as the league continues reacting to the coronavirus pandemic.

Late next week, the National Football League will be releasing its full 17-week 2020 schedule without any changes to it, despite the coronavirus still being around. League spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed to ESPN that the schedule will include its September 7th opener, the Super Bowl on its regular day, and visions of fans in the stands as normal.
The initial schedule also won’t have any Saturday games despite the idea being thrown around earlier this week.
The NFL also isn’t considering gathering players in one location in order to save the season, something that has been brought up by the NBA, MLB, and NHL.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NFL is planning on starting the 2020 season on time despite current public health concerns.
The COVID-19 outbreak has made sports league commissioners think twice as to whether to play out the 2020 seasons. The NCAA essentially had no other choice but to cancel the remainder of its 2020 winter and spring sports seasons. The NBA and MLB continue to be postponed, but there’s optimism both can return later this summer.
College football remains months away from the start of its season. But the involvement of universities could force the NCAA to once again postpone or either cancel the upcoming college football year. Fortunately for the NFL, it can be much more liberal with its plans.
Roger Goodell and the NFL are planning to release the 2020 schedule, without any changes, next week. The league is moving forward with the idea the season will start on time with fans in the stands.
“We plan to start on time,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said, via ESPN.
Of course, this doesn’t ensure the NFL won’t eventually alter the 2020 schedule.
The league continues to monitor the public health dilemma.
In all likelihood, the NFL will find a way to play out the upcoming season – even if it includes games without any fans in attendance.

Sports Business Daily reported on Monday that the NFL was forming contingency plans in case its schedule of games needs to be altered, including delaying season openers by more than a month and moving the Super Bowl to the end of February.
It's unclear whether the coronavirus outbreak will ease enough to allow fans in the stands. ESPN said the NFL won't hunker players in specific locations to play the season, as the NHL, MLB and NBA have discussed.
ESPN also reported that the schedule isn't expected to include early season Saturday games. It had been speculated the NFL might schedule games on Saturday since the college football season remains up in the air.
In the meantime, NFL facilities remain closed, and teams have begun holding virtual workouts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NFL set to release full 17-week schedule next week, league spokesman says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NFL isn't altering its fall plans.
The league will release its 2020 schedule late next week without any major changes, league spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed -- including a Sept. 10 opener, the Super Bowl on Feb. 7 and visions of fans in the stands.
"We plan to start on time," McCarthy said.
ESPN's Chris Mortensen reported in mid-April that the league planned to release its schedule, based on a full season, by May 9. NFL executive vice president Troy Vincent told The Associated Press this week that the league is doing "reasonable and responsible planning" regarding health and safety during the coronavirus pandemic.
The league has evaluated contingency plans should the pandemic intensify, working in conjunction with the NFL Players Association and medical experts on a set of protocols.
One of those contingencies is delaying the season until mid-October, according to the Sports Business Journal. Empty stadiums and no bye weeks have long been discussed.
One option not on the table, a source told ESPN, is gathering players at a centralized location to execute a season. The NBA and Major League Baseball have discussed playing at a neutral site such as Walt Disney World, Las Vegas or Arizona, but the NFL doesn't plan to do that.
The NFL schedule is not expected to include an influx of Saturday games, despite uncertainty about whether college football can start its season on time.
The league is evaluating when players can reenter team facilities. The NFL and NFLPA have agreed to keep buildings closed until every state in which a team resides lifts its stay-at-home mandate. Teams are prepared to conduct offseason workouts and June minicamps virtually.
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell will not accept a salary during the pandemic. The league raised more than $100 million for coronavirus relief during the NFL draft.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Report: NFL to release full, unaltered schedule next week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It appears to be business as usual for the NFL — at least for now.
The NFL plans to reveal an unaltered 2020 schedule late next week, according to ESPN‘s Jeremy Fowler, despite the COVID-19 pandemic that has put most sports leagues in the Western world on pause and the resumption of their seasons in question.
Fowler reports the full 17-week slate will include a Sept. 10 opener a Feb. 7 Super Bowl and “visions of fans in the stands.”
However, the NFL has developed contingency plans in conjunction with the NFL Players Association and medical experts should the pandemic intensify.
One of those would reportedly involve postponing the season until mid-October. Empty stadiums and no bye weeks have also been part of talks. The option of a centralized location for games, though, is not on the table, according to ESPN.
The NBA, MLB and NHL, meanwhile, have considered hosting games at neutral sites.

    <h5 class="mb-1">German top-flight soccer team train on after positive coronavirus tests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cologne's players are continuing to train despite three positive tests for coronavirus at the club that have unsettled the German soccer league's restart plans.
Cologne said last week that three people had tested positive but didn't name them or say whether they were players, who are currently training in small groups.
"The experts evaluate it as such that, due to the hygiene and infection prevention measures in group training, we can continue to train with those who tested negatively as we had been," team doctor Paul Klein said on the club website.
Klein added that no one at the club was considered "category one" in respect of the three individuals who gave samples Thursday.
That is typically someone who either lives with an infected person or had close contact with them.
Players and staff around the league began giving samples on Thursday as part of an ongoing process designed to enable teams to return initially to full training, then to games later this month.
Most teams have not commented on test results.
Werder Bremen said samples given on Thursday by its players and staff were all negative and that they will undergo another round of testing on Sunday.
Meanwhile in Italy, Sassuolo are set to become the first Serie A side to re-start training following the coronavirus shutdown after saying their players could use the club's facilities from Monday on an optional basis.
Regional neighbours Bologna, meanwhile, say their players will be able to start training from Tuesday.
Serie A has been suspended since March 9 and the league and the Italian soccer federation (FIGC) both want to complete the season although the Italian government says it has not yet decided whether it will give permission.
The government has given professional teams permission to train together from May 18 although they will still have to respect social distancing guidelines.
Sassuolo and Bologna are based in the region of Emilia Romagna which has given special permission for athletes in team sports to take part in training sessions on an individual basis from May 4 onwards.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cologne continues training despite tests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">COLOGNE, Germany — Cologne's players are continuing to train despite the three positive tests for coronavirus at the club that have unsettled the German soccer league's restart plans.
Cologne said Friday that three people had tested positive but didn't name them or say whether they were players, who are currently training in small groups.
“The experts evaluate it as such that, due to the hygiene and infection prevention measures in group training, we can continue to train with those who tested negatively as we had been,” team doctor Paul Klein said on the club website Saturday.
Klein added nobody at the club was considered “category one” in respect of the three individuals who gave samples Thursday. That is typically someone who either lives with an infected person or had close contact with them.
Cologne's announcement brought criticism from Karl Lauterbach, a lawmaker with the Social Democratic Party, the junior partner in Angela Merkel's coalition government.
Lauterbach said on Twitter that “probably two players, one staffer” were infected. He is a professor of health economics and was based at Cologne University before entering politics.
“I am surprised that players allow this to be done to them. Football should be a role model, not ‘bread and circuses,’” he wrote in reference to training sessions.
Players and staff around the league began giving samples Thursday as part of an ongoing process designed to enable teams to return initially to full training, then to games later this month.
Most teams have not commented on test results. Werder Bremen said samples given Thursday by its players and staff were all negative, and that they will undergo another round of testing Sunday. Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfurt also reported only negative tests.
One player from another Bundesliga club, Paderborn, tested positive in March.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Football: Three test positive for COVID-19 at FC Cologne</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">REUTERS: German top-flight soccer team FC Cologne said on Friday (May 1) that group training was continuing despite three people at the club testing positive for COVID-19.
In a statement the Bundesliga side said the entire squad and coaching staff had been tested on Thursday.
"Three people tested positive, all are symptom free," the club statement said. "After an assessment of the cases by the responsible health authorities, the three people who tested positive will go into a 14-day quarantine at home."
Cologne said they would not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of the individuals involved.
While Bundesliga clubs have returned to training, they must wait another week to find out about a possible restart to the season after the German government on Thursday delayed any decision over a league resumption amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The cash-strapped clubs and league had been hoping for the government to give the green light and end a two-month suspension but Chancellor Angela Merkel has said any decision on if and when sports could resume would be taken on May 6.
Germany has suffered over 6,500 deaths from coronavirus with more than 162,00 people infected.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Soccer training goes on at Cologne despite positive tests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">COLOGNE, Germany (AP) - Cologne’s players are continuing to train despite the three positive tests for coronavirus at the club that have unsettled the German soccer league’s restart plans.
Cologne said Friday that three people had tested positive but didn’t name them or say whether they were players, who are currently training in small groups.
“The experts evaluate it as such that, due to the hygiene and infection prevention measures in group training, we can continue to train with those who tested negatively as we had been,” team doctor Paul Klein said on the club website Saturday.
Klein added nobody at the club was considered “category one” in respect of the three individuals who gave samples Thursday. That is typically someone who either lives with an infected person or had close contact with them.
Cologne’s announcement brought criticism from Karl Lauterbach, a lawmaker with the Social Democratic Party, the junior partner in Angela Merkel’s coalition government.
Lauterbach said on Twitter that “probably two players, one staffer” were infected. He is a professor of health economics and was based at Cologne University before entering politics.
“I am surprised that players allow this to be done to them. Football should be a role model, not ‘bread and circuses,’” he wrote in reference to training sessions.
Players and staff around the league began giving samples Thursday as part of an ongoing process designed to enable teams to return initially to full training, then to games later this month.
Most teams have not commented on test results. Werder Bremen said samples given Thursday by its players and staff were all negative, and that they will undergo another round of testing Sunday. Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfurt also reported only negative tests.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Plan for NBA to finish season in Vegas pushed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MGM Resorts International has pitched a proposal to the NBA to complete the coronavirus-halted 2019-20 season on courts in Las Vegas convention centers, the New York Times reported.
The plan, according to the newspaper, would have players and their families, plus other essential personnel, stay in a quarantined area in MGM hotels along the Las Vegas Strip while practicing and competing on courts in the same facilities.
Players and broadcasters would have access to the usual resort facilities while in the protected area under the plan by MGM, which has 13 Vegas resort properties.
The plan would convert MGM convention centers into 24 basketball courts, five of them equipped with cameras to permit television coverage, and players would reside in connected or nearby hotels.
ESPN has reported the NBA is looking at a similar quarantined area in Orlando involving hotels and courts in private Disney World areas.
The NBA halted its season in March after Utah's Rudy Gobert tested positive for the deadly virus and the league has announced no plan for resuming games or even a timetable for returning to competition.
The league will allow players to conduct individual workouts at team facilities starting Friday in areas where stay-at-home laws allow, the first small step toward resumption.
No plan among those floated in US media has included spectators at games, most focusing on a one-site bubble where players might live and play, and only once coronavirus tests are available in sufficient numbers to the public and the NBA has enough tests for everyone involved.
The Mandalay Bay resort, with 4,700 rooms available over three connected hotels, would be the central hub of the MGM Vegas plan. An enclosed walkway would connect the Luxor, where caterers and housekeepers would reside.

In such a plan, players are expected to need a training camp of more than three weeks to prepare for games, which could include the final month of the regular season and two months of playoff contests.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Had to flee after being constantly threatened by Umar Akmal: Zulqarnain Haider</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KARACHI: Pakistan's former wicketkeeper-batsman Zulqarnain Haider has blamed Umar Akmal for his disappearing act during an ODI series against South Africa in 2010, saying he was threatened by the tainted player for not conniving with him to lose a match.
Zulqarnain claimed that he was forced to leave his team hotel in Dubai and fly out to London under mysterious circumstances after receiving threatening messages from his then teammate Umar and a few others after he refused to under-perform in the third one-day international of the same series.
"I remember telling him to just do his job and carry the drinks. But later he (Umar) and some others directly threatened me and kept on badgering me so much that I came under psychological pressure and fear and flew to London without informing anyone," he said in an interview.
Zulqarnain's promising career ended following that episode in November 2010.

He said the three-year ban on Umar for not revealing spot-fixing approaches is too lenient.
"He has been involved in shady dealings and not only does he deserve a life ban even his property and assets should be seized," Zulqarnain said on Saturday.
Zulqarnain, who is 34 now, had sought asylum in London after leaving the team hotel in Dubai without informing the management.
The wicketkeeper, who scored 88 runs in the only Test he played at Birmingham in 2010 in place of Kamran Akmal, claimed that he had reported the matter of Umar telling him to under-perform to the management.
"But the threats and pressure were too much for me to bear and I left. I was also getting threats from some unknown persons to under perform," he said.
Zulqarnain returned to Lahore in 2011 on the assurances of the then interior minister, Rehman Malik, but he has not been able to resurrect his cricket career.
Pakistan then team's manager, Intikhab Alam, had described Zulqarnain as a troubled young man with mental issues.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A look back at other ‘ghost goals’ on 15-year anniversary of Luis Garcia’s</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On May 3, 2005, Luis Garcia scored a controversial goal to help Liverpool past Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final, with the ball seemingly not going over the line before being cleared.
Here, the PA news agency looks at other ‘ghost goals’, some awarded, some not.
Arguably the most famous contentious goal in English history, there are still question marks over whether Sir Geoff Hurst’s second goal in the 1966 World Cup final crossed the line. With the game level at 2-2 in extra-time, Hurst collected a cross from Alan Ball and sent an effort crashing onto the underside of the bar. Linesman Tofiq Bahramov indicated the ball had crossed the line, though it is unclear from footage, and the referee Gottfried Dienst awarded the goal. It gave England the lead, with Hurst completing his hat-trick soon after.
The Three Lions were on the other end of a decision in the 2010 World Cup, though this was nowhere near as marginal. In the last-16 encounter in South Africa, Fabio Capello’s men were trailing 2-1 when, on the stroke of half-time, Frank Lampard’s shot from the edge of the area hit the crossbar and obviously looked to bounce over the line by a couple of yards. The linesman was not level with play and the referee was unsighted so no goal was awarded, to the dismay of England. Replays confirmed the ball had clearly crossed the line and the Three Lions went on to lose 4-1.
One of the most bizarre goals ever awarded saw fresh-faced referee Stuart Atwell at the heart of the controversy. In a Championship game, Reading had a corner which hit Watford defender John Eustace and bounced well wide of the goal. It was so wide that a Reading player stretched to keep the ball in play and a scramble ensued. Afterwards, linesman Nigel Bannister called Atwell over and – duped by an optical illusion – insisted the ball had gone into the net when it deflected off Eustace. There was carnage as Watford protested the decision, with manager Aidy Bothroyd sent to the stands. The game ended 2-2.
Only the most bizarre set of circumstances saw Stefan Kiessling awarded a goal for Leverkusen in a 2013 Bundesliga match. With the visitors leading 1-0 at Hoffenheim, Kiessling jumped highest from a corner and sent a header goalwards. On first viewing it looked a routine goal, beating the goalkeeper at the near post. However, replays showed that the ball hit the side-netting, with Kiessling holding his head in disappointment, but the ball went through a hole in the net and ended up in the goal. Kiessling tried telling the referee that it did not go in but the goal stood and Leverkusen went on to win 2-1.
Tottenham rarely win at Old Trafford, so they could have done with a bit of fortune in 2004, but they were found wanting. With the game drifting to a 0-0 draw, Spurs midfielder Pedro Mendes spotted United goalkeeper Roy Carroll off his line and tried an audacious shot from near the halfway line. A back-pedalling Carroll was in position to catch the ball but inexplicably let it slip through his hands and it landed a couple of yards over the line. The match officials were nowhere near level and were fooled by Carroll’s poker-face reaction, having scooped the ball away.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Here, the PA news agency looks at other 'ghost goals', some awarded, some not.
Arguably the most famous contentious goal in English history, there are still question marks over whether Sir Geoff Hurst's second goal in the 1966 World Cup final crossed the line. With the game level at 2-2 in extra-time, Hurst collected a cross from Alan Ball and sent an effort crashing onto the underside of the bar. Linesman Tofiq Bahramov indicated the ball had crossed the line, though it is unclear from footage, and the referee Gottfried Dienst awarded the goal. It gave England the lead, with Hurst completing his hat-trick soon after.
The Three Lions were on the other end of a decision in the 2010 World Cup, though this was nowhere near as marginal. In the last-16 encounter in South Africa, Fabio Capello's men were trailing 2-1 when, on the stroke of half-time, Frank Lampard's shot from the edge of the area hit the crossbar and obviously looked to bounce over the line by a couple of yards. The linesman was not level with play and the referee was unsighted so no goal was awarded, to the dismay of England. Replays confirmed the ball had clearly crossed the line and the Three Lions went on to lose 4-1.
One of the most bizarre goals ever awarded saw fresh-faced referee Stuart Atwell at the heart of the controversy. In a Championship game, Reading had a corner which hit Watford defender John Eustace and bounced well wide of the goal. It was so wide that a Reading player stretched to keep the ball in play and a scramble ensued. Afterwards, linesman Nigel Bannister called Atwell over and – duped by an optical illusion – insisted the ball had gone into the net when it deflected off Eustace. There was carnage as Watford protested the decision, with manager Aidy Bothroyd sent to the stands. The game ended 2-2.
Only the most bizarre set of circumstances saw Stefan Kiessling awarded a goal for Leverkusen in a 2013 Bundesliga match. With the visitors leading 1-0 at Hoffenheim, Kiessling jumped highest from a corner and sent a header goalwards. On first viewing it looked a routine goal, beating the goalkeeper at the near post. However, replays showed that the ball hit the side-netting, with Kiessling holding his head in disappointment, but the ball went through a hole in the net and ended up in the goal. Kiessling tried telling the referee that it did not go in but the goal stood and Leverkusen went on to win 2-1.
Tottenham rarely win at Old Trafford, so they could have done with a bit of fortune in 2004, but they were found wanting. With the game drifting to a 0-0 draw, Spurs midfielder Pedro Mendes spotted United goalkeeper Roy Carroll off his line and tried an audacious shot from near the halfway line. A back-pedalling Carroll was in position to catch the ball but inexplicably let it slip through his hands and it landed a couple of yards over the line. The match officials were nowhere near level and were fooled by Carroll's poker-face reaction, having scooped the ball away.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aston Villa captain Dennis Mortimer shows the First Division trophy off to a crowd of thousands outside Birmingham Town Hall after the 1980-81 title triumph.
It was Villa’s seventh league championship but their first since 1910 and was sealed despite a 2-0 defeat against Arsenal at Highbury on the final day of the season.
Ron Saunders’ side pipped Ipswich to the summit by four points, with a seven-match winning run from January to March proving pivotal to their success.
Villa used just 14 players over the course of the campaign, with Mortimer one of seven that were ever-present. The others were Jimmy Rimmer, Kenny Swain, Ken McNaught, Des Bremner, Gordon Cowans and Tony Morley.
Mortimer, who had already lifted the League Cup with the club in 1977, went on to captain the Villains to the European Cup in 1982 with a 1-0 victory over Bayern Munich in Rotterdam.
Liverpool-born midfielder Mortimer made nearly 600 appearances in the Football League, which also included a spell at rivals Birmingham, but was never capped by England at senior level.

    <h5 class="mb-1">England 'on edge' over Twenty20 World Cup</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England batsman Jason Roy admits his teammates are "on edge" as they wait to see if they will be able to take part in the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia later this year.
There are serious question marks over the tournament going ahead amid the uncertainties sparked by the global coronavirus pandemic.
The tournament – which offers the likes of Roy a unique opportunity to become double world champions following England's win on home turf in the 50-over competition last year – is scheduled for October, but at present the idea of 16 teams converging in one place seems a potential health risk.
And Roy admitted England's players were beginning to ask their own questions.
"I think all the boys are on edge, waiting for the call," he said.
"If players aren't able to prepare in the right way and are not able to get over to Australia, then it makes sense to postpone it. But if it goes ahead, it's our job to play cricket.
"If we're told we have three weeks to prepare to go and play in the World T20, all the boys will be putting the yards in to make sure we're ready for that. We'll get in the nets and go hit some balls."
Roy has also reflected on his brief stint in Test cricket, which came straight off the back of his World Cup heroics but ended after just five caps following a difficult Ashes series in England last year.
Rory Burns, Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley are all now ahead in the England pecking order as openers but a second chance in the middle order has crossed Roy's mind.
He added: "I think they found a nice couple of players to fill that [opening] spot but I worked very, very hard to crack the nut in Test cricket and for it to get taken away from me that quickly, obviously after a couple of bad scores, was really heartbreaking.
"There's no doubt in my mind that I'm going to be trying my hardest to get back into the side."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19 could lead to hockey’s slow death in Pakistan: PHF</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hockey in Pakistan is already under severe financial stress and the coronaviruspandemic has only made the situation more worrisome and could lead to the slow death of the national sport in the country, said PHF secretary general Asif Bajwa.
With three Olympic gold and four World Cup crowns, Pakistan hockey has a rich history. But of late, the sport is struggling to survive in the country because of lack of sponsors owing to the national team’s poor show at the international stage.
The Covid-19 pandemic has only made the situation critical.
“The coronavirus pandemic is having very negative effects on hockey. Already the PHF and the sport was facing financial crunch in the country and now the situation has only gone from bad to worse,” Bajwa said on Saturday.
He said the pandemic, which has so far claimed close to 2,40,000 lives, had left many players jobless and without any income.
“The federation is also unfortunately not in a financial position where it can do much for these players,” Bajwa, a former Olympian said.
The PHF official said many players, who are employed with departments, are facing problems while those who went to play in professional hockey leagues all over the world to earn good money are also living in uncertainty because of complete halt in sporting activities across the globe.
He said a difficult time is in the offing for sports in Pakistan as and when things return to normal.
“It is a sad story for sports, including hockey in Pakistan right now. When normal activities resume even then the PHF requires lot of money to reactivate hockey and send the senior and junior teams abroad for international events.”
Bajwa urged the government and private sector to step in and bail out hockey. “It is unfortunate but hockey is a sport in which we have been world champions, Olympic gold medallists, Asian champions and won so many titles. But right now hockey is in a very bad state,” he signed off.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Colombia international is widely expected to leave the Bernabeu during this summer's transfer window, having found it difficult to contribute this season after returning from a two-year loan spell at Bayern Munich.
A number of clubs, including Arsenal, Everton, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Manchester United, have been credited with an interest in the 28-year-old.
However, according to reports in Spain, Juve are firmly in the hunt for the South American, who could allegedly be available for a figure in the region of €40m (£35m) ahead of the 2020-21 campaign.
Old Lady boss Maurizio Sarri is said to view Rodriguez as the perfect player to provide extra support for Cristiano Ronaldo in the final third of the field.
The playmaker's current deal at the Bernabeu is due to expire next summer.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">French wonderkid William Saliba is reportedly set to join Arsenal ‘earlier than expected’ following the end of the Ligue 1 season.
Saliba was signed from Saint-Etienne for £27million (fee via BBC Sport) last summer, but was immediately loaned back out to the club where he made his name.
Coronavirus has provoked the French Football Federation (FFF) into cancelling the French leagues. According to French publication RMC Sport, this means the 19-year-old will return to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.
Saliba wouldn’t be eligible to play for the Gunners if the 2019/20 season continues, but will be able to train with them. This would help prepare him for the upcoming season, and allow him to get used to playing under the Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta.
The centre back’s season has been disrupted with a metatarsal fracture and a hamstring injury, only allowing him to make 12 league appearances. In 2019, Saliba had started 13 times in Ligue 1, with St-Etienne winning 11 of those fixtures – a win rate of 84.6%.
This is sure to excite Arsenal fans. However, Saliba perhaps lacks the necessary experience to be able to start games regularly in the Premier League and will be one for the future at the north London club.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Transfer News: Barcelona ready to listen to offers for Luis Suarez amid coronavirus crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to a report from Spanish publication MARCA, La Liga champions Barcelona are willing to listen to offers for star striker Luis Suarez in the summer, with a number of clubs in the MLS interested.
Suarez has been with Barcelona for almost six years now, having signed from Liverpool back in 2014. The Uruguayan international has grown into one of the deadliest strikers in Europe during his stint at Camp Nou, helping the club to numerous trophies and titles.
Till date, the 33-year-old has bagged 191 goals and created 108 more in 270 matches for Barcelona. However, over the past couple of seasons, Suarez has shown signs of age catching up with him, with injuries hampering him quite often. In fact, the striker was unavailable since January this season as well, having undergone an operation on his knee.
In spite of his advancing years and injury issues, Suarez has continued to contribute heavily in the final third, having bagged 14 goals and 11 assists in just 23 matches in the 2019-20 season. However, Barcelona are now considering the possibility of offloading the veteran in the summer.
This move comes due to the fact that finances have been affected because of the coronavirus crisis. With the La Liga and Champions League suspended, Barcelona have been deprived of matchday income for almost two months now. The situation is unlikely to see a major improvement once the season resumes, as matches are likely to be played behind closed doors.
With Barcelona planning a huge summer outlay for the likes of Lautaro Martinez and Neymar, they are looking at player sales as a possible means of raising funds. And Suarez could be among a number of players who are likely be shown the doors at Camp Nou.
This development has put several clubs in the Major League Soccer (MLS) on high-alert. David Beckham’s Inter Miami are one of the suitors, with the former Manchester United and Real Madrid superstar having spoken about the possibility of signing Suarez in the past.
The 33-year-old veteran striker himself has admitted to being open to playing in the MLS one day. Suarez’s contract with Barcelona runs till 2021, with the club retaining the option of extending it by another year, provided he features in 60% of matches in the 2020-21 season.
Suarez remains a key player within the Barcelona setup and enjoys a great relationship with his teammates, especially club captain and talisman Lionel Messi. It now remains to be seen if the Catalans do go through with the sale of the former Liverpool man come summer.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4"> ’Tosin Oluwalowo
Lille have received an €85m bid for Nigerian striker, Victor Osimhen, according to Telefoot.
According to the report, the unnamed club is interested in securing the services of Osimhen in the summer.
The Super Eagles forward has been the subject of interest of clubs, especially in the English Premier League.
The clubs include Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal.
Osimhen has been in great form since joining Lille from Belgian side Sporting Charleroi last summer and scored18 goals in 38 games.
Lille President,  Gerard Lopez, had earlier in the year spoken about how hard it might be for the club to keep the Nigeria international.
“Osimhen will be in Lille next season. Afterwards, there are factors I cannot control, such as the fact that a club comes and offers a salary that is six or eight times more than we can offer.
“But I think it is sometimes better not to take a high salary and wait for the next season,” Lopez told French media.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Spadafora reaffirms May 18 date for Serie A clubs to resume team training</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Italian sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora has reiterated Serie A team training will still not resume before May 18, despite the government allowing players to return to club facilities from Monday.
A statement from Italy's Home Office on Sunday declared individual athletes - including those who play for teams - can undertake sports activities again, provided they maintain social distancing.
On Saturday, Sassuolo became the first Serie A club to confirm they would be going back to training since the season was halted due to the coronavirus crisis.
Others in the top tier have since followed suit, including Inter, who will make pitches at their Appiano Gentile available to first-team squad members, albeit on a voluntary basis.
"The resumption of competitive activities will be determined and communicated as soon as the relevant regulatory framework is finalised," Inter said in a statement.
"All the other areas of the centre will remain closed with the exception of the on-site health and technical facility, which is required to ensure a safe environment and safeguard the athletes."
It is also reported table-topping Juventus - who sit one point clear of nearest rivals Lazio at the summit - have asked their players who are currently abroad to return to Italy, allowing them to undergo a period of isolation ahead of a potential resumption.
However, Spadafora had made clear full training will not be allowed before the country's lockdown measures expire on May 17.
"I read strange things around but nothing has changed compared to what I have always said about football: the teams' training will not resume before 18 May and the resumption of the championship for now is not really talked about," he wrote on Facebook.
"Now sorry but I'm going back to deal with all the other sports and sports centres (gyms, dance centres, swimming pools, etc) that must reopen as soon as possible!"
Italy has been one of the countries to suffer the most during the health crisis, with over 28,000 deaths related to COVID-19.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Serie A’s Sassuolo say players can start training from Monday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sassuolo are set to become the first Serie A side to re-start training following the coronavirus shutdown after saying their players could use the club’s facilities from Monday on an optional basis.
Bologna, meanwhile, say their players will be able to start training from Tuesday.
Serie A has been suspended since March 9 and the league and the Italian football federation (FIGC) both want to complete the season although the Italian government says it has not yet decided whether it will give permission.
The government has given professional teams permission to train together from May 18 although they will still have to respect social distancing guidelines.
Sassuolo and Bologna are based in the region of Emilia Romagna which has given special permission for athletes in team sports to take part in training sessions on an individual basis from May 4 onwards.
“Sassuolo announces that, from Monday May 4, they will grant their players use of the Mapei Football Centre pitches for optional, individual sessions,” Sassuolo said in a statement.
The club said that only players would be allowed to access the pitches while the use of indoor facilities would be prohibited. Under Sassuolo’s guidelines, each player would have half a pitch to himself.
“The individual sessions will take place in the morning, from Monday to Friday, with the use of three pitches, with six athletes per hour (one athlete for each half of the field),” the club said, adding that coaching staff would not be present.
“An emergency health service will be guaranteed,” it added.
Bologna announced similar guidelines while Parma and SPAL, also based in Emilia Romagna, have not yet indicated whether they will start training.
The region of Campania, which includes Naples, has also said that players can begin training although Napoli have yet to comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">League, federation to decide when La Liga returns, says Spanish PM</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JOHANNESBURG - Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he hopes La Liga returns “soon” and it will be the leagues and federation that decide when after the government began easing coronavirus restrictions.
The sports ministry approved La Liga’s plans on Thursday for clubs to test their players for the coronavirus before they return to training as the league looks to restart the season in June after it was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Spain, one of Europe’s worst-hit countries with 25,100 deaths, imposed a strict lockdown in March, confining most of the population to their homes. Yet after 49 days, they have now allowed people to leave their homes for exercise.
“I’m more of a basketball fan than a football fan, but let’s hope football returns soon,” Sanchez told reporters.
“It will be the league and the federation to decide (when they return).
“We have started to allow individual training for team sports. Let’s hope it’s soon, but we’ll see it sooner on TV than in the stadium, I’m afraid.”
Squads will return to training in phases next week, first training individually, then moving to training in small groups and finally to full group training — which needs to last at least two weeks before they can return to full competition.
Spain’s major sports institutions and the government’s department for sport are committed to completing the season.

Spain, one of Europe's worst-hit countries with 25,100 deaths, imposed a strict lockdown in March, confining most of the population to their homes. Yet after 49 days, they have now allowed people to leave their homes for exercise.
"I'm more of a basketball fan than a football fan, but let's hope football returns soon," Sanchez told reporters.
"It will be the league and the federation to decide (when they return).
"We have started to allow individual training for team sports. Let's hope it's soon, but we'll see it sooner on TV than in the stadium, I'm afraid."
Squads will return to training in phases next week, first training individually, then moving to training in small groups and finally to full group training - which needs to last at least two weeks before they can return to full competition.
Spain's major sports institutions and the government's department for sport are committed to completing the season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Andy Dalton, Cowboys agree to 1-year deal, team announces</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Quarterback Andy Dalton and the Dallas Cowboys agreed to a one-year deal Saturday that guarantees the former Cincinnati Bengals signal-caller $3 million, and it could be worth up to $7 million with incentives.
The agreement was first reported by ESPN.
The Bengals released Dalton this past Thursday, which basically guaranteed No. 1 overall pick Joe Burrow the starting job in Cincinnati. Two days later, the Cowboys came calling for a backup quarterback to starter Dak Prescott.
EAGLES' GM: TEAM 'MARRIED' TO QB CARSON WENTZ
Dalton, who was born and raised in the Houston area, led Texas Christian University [TCU] to an undefeated 2010 season before the Bengals drafted him in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft.
The Cowboys’ backup quarterback to Prescott the past two seasons was Cooper Rush, so Dalton definitely represented a significant upgrade at the position in case Prescott were to hold out due to a contract dispute or if he were to get injured. The Cowboys have placed the franchise tag on Prescott, who hasn't signed the one-year tender worth about $31 million. However, the sides would have until July 15 to get a long-term contract done.
Dalton started 133 games under center for the Bengals and led the franchise to five straight playoff appearances -- from 2011 to 2015 -- but Cincinnati lost in the first round each time, which set an NFL record.

Dalton's 70-61-2 record as a starter was the second-best by a Bengals quarterback with at least 10 starts, trailing Virgil Carter. Dalton held the club records for touchdown passes (204) and completions (2,757).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dallas Cowboys News: Andy Dalton Finds A New Home With One-Year Deal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Danny Cox
It took less than a week for quarterback Andy Dalton to go from a free agent to a new home in Texas. Earlier this week, Dalton was released by the Cincinnati Bengals after nine years with the team. He has never played a single snap for another team during his NFL career, but that is going to change now since the Dallas Cowboys have signed him to a one-year deal.
ESPN is reporting that Dalton, who was released by Cincinnati on Thursday, struck a deal with the Cowboys on a $3 million contract. With incentives and playing time stipulations built into it, the deal could be worth as much as $7 million.
Dalton lives in Dallas, even though he’s played for the Bengals since 2011. The quarterback went to TCU for his collegiate career, and his family has remained in Texas throughout his professional career.
Dalton became expendable after the Bengals selected LSU’s Joe Burrow with the first overall pick in last month’s NFL Draft. Dalton, a former second-round draft pick, had one year remaining on his contract with the Bengals, and he was going to earn $17.7 million before being released.
Now, he’ll battle for the backup spot behind Dak Prescott in Dallas.
Many reports thought that Dalton might have landed with the New England Patriots or Jacksonville Jaguars.
Dalton chose to stay close to home in Texas and not move his family around during a difficult time. The coronavirus pandemic has brought about a lot of fear and uncertainty around the world, but the NFL is planning to start the regular season on time in September.
Before joining the Cowboys on Saturday, Dalton was a bit critical of his former team as they let him go two months after free agency began. The official website of the Cincinnati Bengals spoke with Dalton, who said that his late release offered fewer opportunities.
Dalton has the most experience of any quarterback on the Cowboys roster. Prescott is entering his fifth year, while Cooper Rush is in his fourth, but Rush has only attempted three passes in those four years. Clayton Thorson and rookie Ben DiNucci round out the crop of signal-callers in Dallas.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Veteran quarterback Andy Dalton signs 1-year deal with Dallas Cowboys</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Dallas Cowboys have yet to reach an agreement on a long-term deal with Dak Prescott, but on Saturday night they did add some insurance at the quarterback position.
Dallas signed nine-year veteran Andy Dalton to a one-year contract worth $7 million, with $3 million of it guaranteed, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to announce the move.
The Cowboys announced Dalton's signing late Saturday.
Dalton landed his next contract two days after the Cincinnati Bengals released him. Dalton had been the Bengals’ franchise quarterback ever since they drafted him in the second round of the 2011 draft.
He helped lead the team to five straight playoff appearances from 2011-15. But they had missed the postseason in each of the last four seasons.
Cincinnati went 2-14 last season and landed the first pick in this year’s draft and used that to select LSU’s Joe Burrow, which made Dalton expendable as the franchise rebuilds under second-year head coach Zac Taylor.
Dalton was expected to draw interest from several teams, and league insiders believed he could wind up in either Jacksonville or New England.
But the Katy, Texas, native and Texas Christian University product instead will return to his home state and back up Prescott for the coming year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dallas Cowboys sign QB Andy Dalton, says report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Dallas Cowboys have reportedly signed former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton.
According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, NFL franchise the Cowboys signed Dalton to a one-year deal after his Cincinnati exit.
The deal is reportedly worth a guaranteed $3million and could be worth up to $7m.
Dalton spent nine seasons with the Bengals and helped lead them to the playoffs five times before he was released on Thursday after Cincinnati drafted quarterback Joe Burrow with the top overall pick in last month's draft.
Dalton posted a 70-61-2 regular-season record as Cincinnati's starting QB, but the Bengals have not won a playoff game since 1990.
In Dallas, Dalton will serve as backup to Dak Prescott – who was given the franchise tag by the Cowboys earlier this offseason.
Dallas are still trying to come to a long-term contract agreement with Prescott.
Dalton – the Bengals' career leader in touchdown passes and a three-time Pro Bowler – already has a home in Dallas and played in college at nearby TCU.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reports: QB Dalton joins Cowboys on one-year deal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two days after his release from the Cincinnati Bengals, quarterback Andy Dalton agreed to sign a one-year deal with the Dallas Cowboys to back up Dak Prescott, multiple outlets reported Saturday night.
Dalton’s deal is reportedly worth up to $7 million, with $3 million guaranteed. The 32-year-old, who played in college at TCU, already has a home in Dallas and won’t need to move, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported.
He had been connected to the Jacksonville Jaguars — whose offensive coordinator, Jay Gruden, coached Dalton for two years in Cincinnati — the New York Jets and the New England Patriots.
Dalton was released Thursday after nine seasons with the Bengals, who drafted LSU’s Joe Burrow with the first overall pick last weekend. Dalton was due to earn $17.7 million in 2020, the final season of a six-year contract extension he signed in August 2014.
He told the Bengals’ website in a story published Friday that the timing of his release limited his options.
“This year there were a good amount of quarterbacks that were available,” Dalton said. “I think it would have worked out differently if I had been a free agent when the new league year started (in March). I was still under contract, and that hurt me.”
Dalton ranks first in Bengals history in touchdown passes (204) and second in passing yards (31,594). The three-time Pro Bowl selection started 133 of the Bengals’ 144 regular-season games over the past nine seasons and had a 70-61-2 record.
He threw for 3,494 yards, 16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 13 games last year, getting benched briefly in the middle of the season in favor of rookie Ryan Finley.
Prescott received the exclusive franchise tag from the Cowboys before he could hit free agency, giving him a one-year, $31.4 million deal. The sides have until July 15 to work out a long-term extension.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cowboys sign Andy Dalton; veteran QB expected to back up Dak Prescott</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Cowboys on Saturday agreed to a one-year contract with free-agent quarterback Andy Dalton, the team announced.
Dalton, a Texas native who played at nearby TCU and lives in Dallas in the offseason, will receive $3 million guaranteed and can make up to $7 million overall, NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported.

NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, citing an unnamed team source,tweeted that the Dalton signing is an insurance plan in case starter Dak Prescott goes down, not a move on from Prescott after protracted negotiations on along-term contract. The Cowboys placed their exclusive franchise tag on Prescott, which comes with a $31.4 million salary for 2020. The sides have a July 15 deadline to come to terms on a multiyear arrangement.
News of Dalton's signing comes twodays after the Bengals released their former starter after nine seasons. Cincinnati is expected to turn itsoffense over to rookie Joe Burrow, the first overall pick in this year's NFL Draft, immediately.
Last season, Dalton, 32, threw for 16 touchdowns to 14 interceptions in 13 games (seven starts).He completed 59.5 percent of his passes, the second-lowest mark of his career; only his rookie season, in 2011, was worse. He compileda career-worst 78.3 passer rating.
The Cowboys were lacking an experienced backup before adding Dalton. The team's options were Cooper Rush, Clayton Thorson and 2020 draft pick Ben DiNucci.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Andy Dalton agrees to one-year deal with the Cowboys</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Andy Dalton-to-the Patriots talk is officially dead.
The former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback agreed to a one-year deal with the Dallas Cowboys, the team announced Saturday. Dalton’s deal, which could be worth up to $7 million, has a base value of $3 million, according to ESPN.
The 32-year-old Dalton, who will be backing up Dak Prescott, already has a home in Dallas and won’t have to move, according to the report.
After Dalton was released by the Bengals on Thursday, speculation began that he could be a fit for the Patriots, who do not have an established veteran quarterback now that Tom Brady reached a two-year deal with the Buccaneers worth $50 million guaranteed, plus $9 million in incentives. Presently, second-year quarterback Jarrett Stidham tops the Patriots’ depth chart.
Dalton — who reportedly drew “legitimate interest” from the Jaguars — knew his time in Cincinnati was over once the team selected Joe Burrow with the No. 1 pick in the 2020 draft, but said the timing of his exit hurt his free-agency opportunities.
“This year there were a good amount of quarterbacks that were available,” Dalton told the Bengals’ official website on Friday. “I think it would have worked out differently if I had been a free agent when the new league year started. I was still under contract, and that hurt me.”
Dalton, who played for TCU in college, was drafted in 2011 by the Bengals with the 35th pick. The veteran signal caller led Cincinnati to four straight wild-card appearances from 2011-14, but they went 0-4 in those games.
Dalton’s career at Cincinnati bottomed out last season when he threw 14 interceptions and just 16 touchdowns in 13 games for the 2-14 Bengals. He was benched after the October trade deadline for Ryan Finley, who started three games, but Dalton regained his starting job late in the season to lead the Bengals to their two wins.
Though it’s unlikely Dalton ever will start for the Cowboys, Prescott’s long-term future in Dallas isn’t secure either. The Cowboys, who slapped Prescott, 26, with the franchise tag in March, have not yet signed the quarterback to the extension he seeks.
Prescott, along with teammate Ezekiel Elliott, was a subject of controversy during this coronavirus pandemic for holding a party or a friend that had 30 or more people in April, according to a TMZ.com report. Prescott admitted to having friends at his home in Prosper, Texas, but noted in a released statement to Pro Football Talk that less than 10 guests were in attendance.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cowboys, QB Andy Dalton reach agreement on one-year deal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andy Dalton is returning home.
Dalton, who was released by the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday, agreed to a one-year deal with the Dallas Cowboys, the team announced Saturday. The quarterback's deal has a base value of $3 million and could be worth up to $7 million, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Before being selected by the Bengals in the second round of the 2011 NFL draft, Dalton played at TCU in Fort Worth, Texas. He lives in Dallas and will not have to move his family during an offseason that has been made uncertain by the coronavirus pandemic.
Many assumed Dalton, 32, would be in position to find a spot with a less secure starter than Dak Prescott, such as the Jacksonville Jaguars or New England Patriots, but he opted to remain close to home.
Cincinnati drafted LSU quarterback Joe Burrow with the No. 1 overall pick last week, making Dalton expendable. Dalton was set to earn $17.7 million in the final season of a six-year, $96 million contract. In nine seasons with the Bengals, Dalton had a 70-61-2 record and helped them reach the postseason in each of his first five seasons, but he was unable to win a playoff game. He holds the franchise record for touchdown passes with 204 and is second in passing yards (31,594), but he was benched after an 0-8 start to the 2019 season.
He returned to the starting spot for the final five games and recorded both of Cincinnati's victories. According to ESPN Stats & Information research, Dalton's 40.1 Total QBR in 2019 ranked 27th out of 30 qualifying quarterbacks.
The addition of Dalton does not affect the Cowboys' feelings toward Prescott, who was given the exclusive franchise tag in March at a cost of $31.4 million. The Cowboys have wanted to sign Prescott to a multiyear contract since last offseason but have not been able to come to terms on a deal that would make him one of the highest-paid -- if not the highest-paid -- quarterbacks in the NFL.
Prescott, 26, has not missed a game in his career, but the Cowboys viewed the opportunity to add Dalton as too good to pass up. Cooper Rush has served as Prescott's backup the past three seasons, but he has thrown just three passes. As a restricted free agent, Rush is set to make $2.1 million in 2020.
The Cowboys also have quarterbacks Clayton Thorson, who spent last season on the practice squad, and Ben DiNucci on the roster. The Cowboys took DiNucci in the seventh round of last week's NFL draft.
Dalton is a three-time Pro Bowler, and Prescott has made it twice in his four seasons. The only other NFL team with multiple quarterbacks who have each made multiple Pro Bowls is the Falcons; starter Matt Ryan has made four Pro Bowls, and Matt Schaub has made two. The Saints, Ravens and Bears also each have multiple quarterbacks who have made it at least once.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dalton signs with Cowboys as Dak Prescott's backup</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andy Dalton is coming home to Texas as Dak Prescott’s backup with the Dallas Cowboys.
Dalton and the Cowboys agreed Saturday to a one-year deal that guarantees the former Cincinnati starter $3 million and could be worth up to $7 million. The agreement was first reported by ESPN.
The Cowboys reached a deal with Dalton two days after he was released by the Bengals. That moved cleared the way for No. 1 overall draft pick Joe Burrow, who led LSU to the national championship.
Dalton, born and raised in the Houston area, led TCU to an undefeated season that included a Rose Bowl victory over Wisconsin during the 2010 season before the Bengals drafted him in the second round.
The Cowboys have relied on the untested Cooper Rush behind Prescott the past two seasons. The 32-year-old Dalton marks their biggest investment in a veteran backup since Prescott replaced the injured Tony Romo as a rookie in 2016 and ended up taking his job for good.
Dalton started 133 games for the Bengals and led the franchise’s best stretch of playoff appearances - five straight from 2011-15 - but couldn’t get that elusive win.
Cincinnati lost in the first round each time, setting an NFL record. Dalton had a broken thumb and was sidelined for the last of those playoff appearances, which ended in a last-minute meltdown and an 18-16 loss to Pittsburgh during the 2015 season.
Dalton’s 70-61-2 record as a starter is second best by a Bengals quarterback with at least 10 starts, trailing Virgil Carter. Dalton holds the club records for touchdown passes (204) and completions (2,757).
Coach Zac Taylor signaled the end of Dalton’s career in Cincinnati by benching him for three games midway through last year’s 2-14 season, a move that shocked Dalton and his longtime teammates. Dalton was upset the Bengals didn’t try to trade him before the deadline.

The Cowboys have placed the franchise tag on Prescott, who hasn’t signed the one-year tender worth about $31 million. The sides have until July 15 to get a long-term contract done.
Prescott played out his four-year rookie contract, becoming on of the NFL’s best bargains as 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year and a two-time Pro Bowler. The 26-year-old’s representatives and the Cowboys have been working on a long-term deal for about a year.
After leading Dallas to the NFC’s top seed as a rookie in 2016 and losing his first playoff game to Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay, Prescott broke through with his first post-season victory two years later.
The Cowboys entered last season with high expectations and started 3-0 before fading to 8-8 and missing the playoffs. Dallas didn’t renew coach Jason Garrett’s contract and hired Mike McCarthy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Cowboys First-Round Pick Reportedly Signs With New NFL Team</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Late Friday night, a former first-round pick of the Dallas Cowboys reportedly inked a deal with a new NFL team.
Earlier this week, the Miami Dolphins released defensive end Taco Charlton. He was a first-round pick of the Cowboys in 2017, but he fell out of favor after two mediocre seasons in Dallas.
After getting cut by the Dolphins earlier this week, it didn’t take him long to find a new landing spot. According to a new report, Charlton is staying in the AFC and joining a contender.
The former Michigan star reportedly agreed to a deal with the Kansas City Chiefs. According to Yahoo Sports insider Terez Paylor, the Chiefs signed Charlton to a one-year contract.
In 10 games in Miami (five starts), Charlton recorded 21 tackles, a career-high five sacks and two forced fumbles.
The former first-round pick had his best NFL season with the Dolphins, but even the 2019 campaign didn’t come without a few hiccups.
He was a healthy scratch multiple times during the last few weeks of the season, despite his success on the field. That signified the writing on the wall for the former Wolverines pass rusher.
Now he gets a fresh start with the Super Bowl-winning Kansas City Chiefs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Credit for Rohit Sharma's success goes to MS Dhoni: Gautam Gambhir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir believes the credit for Rohit Sharma's meteoric rise in white-ball cricket must be given to former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.
Since making his debut in 2007, Rohit was languishing in the middle-order with consistency being his main issue.
Dhoni seemingly took note of Rohit's hidden talent and gave him a long rope. He then promoted Rohit as opener in 2013 and that move worked wonders for him as the right-hander has gone on to become one of the most lethal top-order batsmen in white-ball cricket.
"Where Rohit Sharma is today, it is because of M.S. Dhoni," Gambhir told Sports Tak.

"You can talk about the selection committee and team management, but if you do not have the backing from your captain then it is all useless. Everything is in the hands of the captain.
"How Dhoni backed Rohit Sharma over a period of time, I don't think any other player has been given such support," he added.
Earlier, Gambhir had described Rohit as the best white-ball cricketer in the world. In his birthday wish for Rohit, Gambhir wrote: "Happy Birthday to the best white-ball cricketer in the world Rohit Sharma! Have a great year ahead!!"
"Don't know about that Gauti bhai. But loving your work," Rohit responded to the high praise from his former teammate.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Told Rohit Sharma he will rule Indian cricket, good on MS Dhoni that he backed him: Gautam Gambhir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In 2012, on India’s tour of Sri Lanka, a certain middle order batsman made 13 runs in five outings for the visitors. That sort of return is enough to end careers, if one is not fortunate or talented enough. But Rohit Sharma certainly had the talent and, perhaps more importantly, had the backing of his captain MS Dhoni after a tour like that.
Not long after, he turned his career around. Today, he is one of the game’s best white-ball openers and is potentially heading towards all-time-great status when it comes to top-order batsmen in the 50-over format.
That evolution of Rohit happened because of his talent and Dhoni’s trust, said former Indian opener Gautam Gambhir.
“I remember Rohit had a miserable Sri Lanka tour,” Gambhir told anchor Jatin Sapru on Star Sports’ ‘Cricket Connected’ show. “When we returned I Whatsapp’d him (probably the first time I did that to anyone), saying that he is going to rule Indian cricket. I knew he had the talent and good on MS Dhoni that he backed him. You have to give a lot of credit to Dhoni for the evolution of Rohit and for making him open the batting. Not a lot of players have been backed the way Rohit has been.”
Watch: When Dhoni surprised Rohit by asking him to open at CT 2013
A large part of Rohit’s turnaround has been his success an opener in ODIs. Even though he had opened a few times in 2011, the experiment started properly in 2013 when the Mumbaikar was making a comeback to the Indian side.
“I remember the first time Rohit opened the batting (when he was making a comeback in 2013) was with me in Mohali against England. He made a half century then and since he then he hasn’t looked back,” Gambhir said.
Dhoni’s gamble with trusting Rohit as an opening batsman is now legendary.
“We felt he was bit of a waste of talent if he was batting at No 6 for us because more often than not he wasn’t getting enough chance to bat as our top-order was quite fixed. We couldn’t really make him play or give him enough opportunities,” Dhoni had said once.
Pause, rewind, play: Watch Rohit Sharma’s three double centuries in ODIs
In fact, 2013 was the watershed year for Sharma. It saw his career take a permanent upswing. His promotion triggered a dramatic turn in fortunes. He went on to play a key role in India’s Champions Trophy triumph in England, scored an ODI double-century against Australia, and guided Mumbai Indians to their first IPL title after being handed captaincy.
The arcs of Virat and Rohit’s wildly contrasting ODI careers
Responding to a question about how Rohit’s success as an opener shows that the criticism that comes his way sometimes regarding his fitness is unfair, Gambhir played down the need for six packs for someone to be a good batsman.
“You don’t need to be a fitness freak, you don’t have to have chiselled bodies and six packs, that is no criteria for being a successful international cricketer. If you are match-fit, you know you can bat for 50 overs, you can bat in the Sri Lankan heat and bat an entire day in Test cricket, that is all you want from a batsman. And he is a brilliant fielder too, very under-rated,” Gambhir added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma should groom youngsters like MS Dhoni groomed them: Gautam Gambhir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After established himself among one of the greatest in the white-ball cricket, Rohit Sharma also proved his mettle in the longest format of the game after being promoted as an opener. Former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir also believes the 33-year-old is among the greatest in limited-overs in the present time and feels MS Dhoni is the man who should be given credit for Rohit's successful cricket career.
Rohit made his debut for India in 2007, but it was only after MS Dhoni promoted him as an opener in 2013 that his career turned around. Today Rohit Sharma is the only player to have hit 3 ODI double hundreds and five World Cup centuries and that is all because he once had strong backing from Dhoni, Gambhir believes.
"Where Rohit Sharma is today, it is because of MS Dhoni," Gambhir told Sports Tak.
"You can talk about the selection committee and team management, but if you do not have the backing from your captain than it is all useless. Everything is in the hands of the captain. How MS Dhoni had backed Rohit Sharma over a period of time, I do not think any player has been given such support."
The 2011 World Cup-winning member also said that Rohit Sharma is the prime example of how a player's fortunes can turn around if he is nurtured by the seniors.
"I hope the young cricketers in the current generation today, be it Shubman Gillm Sanju Samson, they also get similar kind of support. And now when Rohit is a senior, I expect him to give backing to youngsters. Rohit is a prime example of how a player can become a phenomenal cricketer, if he has good backing. One good thing about MS was that he always kept Rohit in the talks, even if was not part of the team, he was always part of the group. He never let him get sidelined."
"I expect Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to groom the youngsters in the same way in which MS Dhoni groomed them."
Rohit Sharma greatest white-ball cricketer in current generation
When Rohit Sharma turned 33 a couple of days back, Gambhir had wished the Mumbai batsman, calling him the greatest white-ball cricketer in the world right now.
Gambhir once again reiterated his thoughts and said no other player has an impact like Rohit Sharma does and thus there is no one like him in the present time.
"I think he is the best white-ball cricketer in the world right now. He is not the greatest overall but at the moment he is the best. He is the only player to have hit 3 ODI double hundreds, 5 World Cup hundreds and he is also the only player, who once gets past 100-run mark, people say that he missed a double century."
"He had hit 5 World Cup hundred in England. People cannot do that in their entire careers. 3 ODI double hundreds, players do not have 3 double hundreds in Tests. There are many who could score runs, but for me white-ball cricket is all about impact. Virat Kohli will end up getting many more runs than Rohit Sharma, and Kohli is among the greatest right now, but Rohit has an edge over Kohli because of the impact he has."
"It is very difficult to compare both of them. Virat Kohli is unbelievable. His stats prove that. But when your reputation is such that when you get out after a hundred, people say he has missed out on double hundred, that speaks volumes about you."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Much like his innings construction in ODI cricket, Rohit Sharma's career is also a collision of two contrasting halves. He averaged 30.84 in ODI cricket from 2007 to 2012 but the next seven years have been a different journey, in which he has averaged a stunning 59.47. Three double centuries are a testament to the amazing transformation. 
But all of that goes back to MS Dhoni’s decision of promoting him to the opening slot ahead of the 2013 Champions Trophy. Gautam Gambhir, who recently labelled Rohit as the best white-ball player in the world at the moment, stated that the credit goes to MS Dhoni for having trust in the latter’s abilities.
"Where Rohit Sharma is today, it is because of M.S. Dhoni. You can talk about the selection committee and team management, but if you do not have the backing from your captain then it is all useless. Everything is in the hands of the captain," Gambhir said in Star Sports' Cricket Connected.
"How Dhoni backed Rohit Sharma over a period of time, I don't think any other player has been given such support," he added.
Rohit currently has 9115 runs to his name with a fantastic average of 49.27 in the 50-over format for India while his five centuries in the 2019 World Cup awarded him with the ICC ODI Player of the Year 2019.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Never know what’s in his mind: MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma’s captaincy styles explained by MSK Prasad</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Over the years, the Indian cricket team has been blessed with some fine captains. Based on numbers the likes of Mohammed Azharuddin, Sourav Ganguy, MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli are the most successful Test captains of India. Two out of the four - Dhoni and Kohli - have captained India for a lot of games when MSK Prasad was the chairman of selectors. Prasad, who was replaced by former India spinner Sunil Joshi as the chief selector a couple of months ago after the former’s term ended, explained the difference in captaincy between current India captain Virat Kohli, former India skipper MS Dhoni and India vice-captain Rohit Sharma. While Kohli-led India has been dominant across formats over the past couple of years, India won three ICC titles including the 2011 World Cup under MS Dhoni’s leadership.
Rohit, who has also led India when Kohli is rested or injured. Under his leadership India won Asia Cup in 2018 and the Nidahas T20I tri-series in Sri Lanka. was recently voted as the most successful captain of the Indian Premier League so far, having already won four titles as skipper.

Speaking in an interview with Fancode, the former India cricketer-turned-selector said: “If you look at fundamental styles, leadership has got so many different styles, these three are three different guys and I am sure all three are equally good.”
Delving deeper into the three captains, Prasad said that while Dhoni is cool and collected on the field, Virat likes to make things clear on what he wants from his team.
“They are three guys who have three different styles. Mahi is absolutely cool, you never know what is there in his mind until it is executed, he’s very very cool, and very very accommodative whereas Virat is pretty clear. He’s at you all the time, he’s very clear in his mind what he wants,” he said.
 
Speaking on Rohit, Prasad said that he is accommodative like Dhoni and likes to think from a player’s position. “If you are talking about Rohit, he’s more of an accommodative sort of a guy. He definitely has that empathy towards other players and he thinks from their hats,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What Would Have Been: Red Sox-Yankees, NHL conference finals</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the sports calendar still mostly on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic, The Associated Press takes a look at some of the live sporting events that would have taken place the week of May 4-10:
MLB: The 162-game regular season would have been about one-fourth complete after the Boston Red Sox played this coming weekend in the Bronx against the Yankees. It would have been the first series this season between the AL East rivals after New York won 14 of 19 games last year, including both games played in London.
New Atlanta Braves pitcher Cole Hamels (shoulder) might not have been ready to pitch in Philadelphia. Hamels began his MLB career with the Phillies from 2006-15, and was the 2008 World Series MVP. In his only start in Philly as a visitor, the lefty allowed eight runs in two-plus innings, an 11-1 loss by the Chicago Cubs last August.
TRIVIA BREAK: When the NBA season was suspended after March 11 games, the Lakers were the only Western Conference team that had clinched a playoff berth. Los Angeles had gone a franchise-worst six consecutive seasons without making the playoffs. What are the only two Western Conference teams with longer active postseason droughts? (Answer at bottom).
NBA: The playoffs would have been in the middle of the second round, with eight teams still in contention for the NBA title.
NHL: The quest for the Stanley Cup would have been down to four teams, with the Eastern and Western Conference finals getting underway.
Advertising
TENNIS: The clay-court Madrid Open was supposed to be this week, one of the key tuneups for the French Open, which normally begins in late May but this year has been postponed until September. Known as the “King of Clay,” Rafael Nadal has won the title in Madrid five times, but surprisingly lost in the 2019 semifinals there to Stefanos Tsitsipas. Novak Djokovic wound up with the trophy.
PGA TOUR: The Byron Nelson tournament was to be played for the final time at Trinity Forest Golf Club. Plans had already been announced for the tournament to move after only three years on the links-style course built on a former landfill south of downtown Dallas. The Nelson moves next year to TPC Craig Ranch north of Dallas.
NASCAR: A week before the return of actual live Cup Series racing in South Carolina, NASCAR is missing what would have been its latest spring race at Martinsville, Virginia, in a half-century. The paperclip-shaped half-mile track is the shortest on the circuit, and hasn’t hosted a spring race past April since 1970.
TRIVIA ANSWER: The Sacramento Kings have missed the playoffs the past 13 seasons and the Phoenix Suns have gone nine seasons in a row without making the postseason. That doesn’t include this season that is still on hold with both teams in the bottom-third of the Western Conference standings.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Snell, Giolito advance to MLB The Show final</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The best player since the start of the MLB The Show Players League is onto the championship series. Stunningly, the same cannot be said of the second-best player.
Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Blake Snell and Texas Rangers slugger Joey Gallo, the only two players to record at least 23 regular-season wins, were both in action Saturday as the playoff weekend continued in the tournament.
Snell, who had a league-best 24-5 record in the regular season, advanced to Sunday’s championship series, coming from behind to top New York Mets infielder Jeff McNeil two games to one in the semifinals. He will face Chicago White Sox starting pitcher Lucas Giolito, who topped Cubs utility man Ian Happ in three games in an all-Windy City semifinal on the other side of the bracket.
First pitch for the best-of-five championship series is set for Sunday at 2:30 p.m. ET on ESPN.
As for Saturday, the most stunning results came in the first sets of games.
Gallo, who finished the regular season 23-6, opened play Saturday with a 3-2 win over Happ but dropped the next two games, 4-3 and then a 7-0 blowout in the deciding game.
It was a similar story for a player tied for the third-best record in the regular season (21-8), as budding Toronto Blue Jays star Bo Bichette hung with Giolito in three tight contests. But after losing the opener 3-2 and winning 1-0 with a run in the third inning in Game 2, Bichette dropped the rubber match. Giolito rode a Nomar Mazara three-run home run to a 5-3 win in the deciding game and a berth in the semis.
In the all-Chicago semifinal, Giolito opened with an 8-4 win. Happ took Game 2 by a 1-0 score, but Giolito — who said he had played very little of MLB The Show 20 prior to this event — booked his spot in the championship with a 3-1 win in the third game.
The highlight of the final game was an insurance home run by White Sox outfielder Luis Robert, one of the most-hyped prospects in baseball who has yet to make his MLB debut.
“That’s his first homer,” Giolito said of the 22-year-old Robert. “That’s his first career homer right there.”
“I’m so glad you hit it right now,” Happ quipped back.
“It’s crazy,” Giolito told MLB.com about advancing to the final. “I never thought I would be playing video games on ESPN. I’ve always been a big video game fan, and whenever I would turn to ESPN and see esports, I would think, ‘Oh that’s pretty cool,’ and now it’s crazy that I’m actually doing it.”
In the other semifinal, McNeil took on Snell in a matchup of Friday’s quarterfinal winners.
McNeil took Game 1 from Snell 4-1 and appeared poised to take the series with Noah Syndergaard on the mound in Game 2. But the tall right-hander — who in real life is out at least all of 2020 after undergoing Tommy John surgery — took a line drive off the head early in the game and had to exit.
It was all Rays from there, as Snell took the game 8-0 and then used home runs from Hunter Renfroe and Willy Adames to win 7-0 in Game 3 and take the series.
“I just stopped talking,” Snell said afterward on the FS1 broadcast of the difference between the first game the next two. “That was my key. Don’t talk and just focus on the game. As I did that, I started squaring it up and was on it more often and was able to put good swings on the ball.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Players League QFs continue at 3 ET on ESPN2</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During the three-week regular season, the 30 participants in the MLB The Show Players League delivered countless celebrations, fun back-and-forth banter and an incredible amount of hilarious moments.
The league served as a fun distraction as we continue to wait for the return of real baseball, while also giving the players an opportunity to showcase a different side of their personalities with the fans.
But with the regular season of the MLB The Show Players League coming to an end, it's now time for the top eight players to duel it out for the virtual World Series. Will top-seeded Blake Snell take home the trophy, even though the difficulty is set on veteran? Will Joey Gallo mash his way to a championship and prove that everything really is bigger in Texas? We'll find out once and for all this weekend.
The action began Friday night, when the first pair of quarterfinals saw Snell and Jeff McNeil advance to the next round. The other two quarterfinal matchups will be shown today at 3 p.m. ET on ESPN2. After that, the semifinals follow, with one matchup set for 3 p.m. ET on ESPN2 and the other series set for 8 p.m. ET on FS1. Then it’s on to the best-of-five virtual World Series, which will air at 2:30 p.m. ET on Sunday on ESPN.
Let's take a look at the remaining quarterfinal matchups.
2. Joey Gallo(Rangers) vs. 7. Ian Happ(Cubs)Saturday, 3 p.m. ET on ESPN2
It didn't take long for Gallo to establish himself as one of the favorites. He opened the season on an 11-game winning streak, leading people to believe that he had a legitimate shot at running the table. But as the regular season went on and his playoff spot all but clinched, Gallo suffered a couple of losses. He would be the first to tell you -- and he actually has -- that he lost some motivation at the end of the regular season, but that will surely change heading into the postseason.
Happ, on the other hand, went 9-9 in his first 18 games, but he then decided to fly the "W" flag in his background and play "Go Cubs Go" after every win. That strategy helped the Cubs utilityman string together 10 straight wins, helping him clinch a playoff berth. Happ could play the role of that Wild Card team that isn't better than the top seeds, but just finds a way to get it done.
3. Bo Bichette(Blue Jays) vs. 6. Lucas Giolito(White Sox)Saturday, 3 p.m. ET on ESPN2
This could turn out to be a really fun series by two really fun players. Bichette's personality started to shine as the league went on, even flashing a Vladdy Jr. sweater after the Blue Jays slugger came through in the clutch for Bichette.
Bichette struck out just one time during the regular season, which is nothing short of incredible. If you play the game, you know. As for Giolito, he punched his ticket to the postseason on Wednesday with a 6-3 win over Amir Garrett on ESPN2. Bichette hopes to carry that momentum into the postseason, even though I'm sure he'll miss having play-by-play announcer Jason Benetti on his stream.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Toronto Defiant's Surefour interview: Echo, Hero Pools, and facing his old team</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the esports world, the Overwatch League has picked back up and is preparing to enter the second half of its third season. As the season reaches its halfway point, the league is going to kick off a new May Tournament, where big money and pride are on the line. One of the most exciting matchups of the first round is set to go down this Sunday, as the Toronto Defiant meet the Los Angeles Gladiators.
Earlier today, we checked in with the Los Angeles Gladiators' Benjamin "BigGoose" Isohanni and Jonas "Shaz" Suovaara. Now we reach out to the Toronto Defiant and specifically say hello to one of the top Widowmaker players in the world, Lane "Surefour" Roberts. This won't be an easy weekend for Surefour. This week's Hero Pool has left Widowmaker banned, leaving Surefour to experiment with Overwatch's newest character Echo, who becomes legal for the first time this weekend. On top of that, this will mark the first time that Surefour has played against the Gladiators, where he spent his first two seasons as one of the team's top players.
Prior to Sunday's game, Shacknews had the opportunity to chat with Surefour. We ask about adjusting to life under quarantine, picking up Echo, Hero Pools, and what it means to face off against his old Gladiators teammates.
Shacknews: We're about halfway into the season and it's your first one as a member of the Toronto Defiant. How have you adjusted to your new team? How would you say the transition has gone?
Lane "Surefour" Roberts: It's been fine. I have not found any challenges in transitioning teams.
Shacknews: The team's record sits at 4-5. It's not where anybody expected to be, I'd imagine. How is the team working to improve in the second half of the season?
Surefour: Except for the small handful of teams at the top, everyone is trying to do the same thing right now. Work on fixing their mistakes and improve as much as they can.
Shacknews: How have you been adjusting to life under quarantine? How has it affected your day-to-day training?
Surefour: Fortunately I have not had to make any major adjustments outside of following social distancing recommendations. The main difference for team activity is that we currently practice from our homes and apartments instead of at the Defiant's training facility.
Shacknews: How would you describe team morale right now after living almost six weeks in quarantine?
Surefour: Team morale hasn't changed from the first week of quarantine to the last week. Everything is pretty much the same. We stay connected online and through our practice sessions.
Shacknews: What are your thoughts on Hero Pools? Do you feel like this was the right move for the league or is there something you feel the league could be doing better?
Surefour: Overall, I think Hero Pools were good for the game. The worst part is when characters I find fun to play are banned. But I know it’s only temporary. I wish Echo hadn't been banned in Competitive the first week she was out, but I look forward to trying her out this weekend in match play.
Shacknews: Lastly, you're about to face off against the Los Angeles Gladiators. What does it mean to you to face your former teammates?
Surefour: If the Defiant win, it will be a bit bittersweet because I want my friends on the Gladiators to be successful. But if the Defiant lose, I'll be sad too. I’ll play my best and we'll see what happens.
The Overwatch League continues this weekend with the start of the May Tournament. The Los Angeles Gladiators face the Toronto Defiant this Sunday at 4PM PT. Catch all of the action live on the Overwatch League YouTube channel.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Carolina Panthers Deny Potentially Troubling NFL Draft Rumor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Carolina Panthers denied a potentially concerning late round NFL Draft rumor after it started to circulate on Saturday.
New Orleans drafted Mississippi State quarterback Tommy Stevens in the seventh round last week. Saints head coach Sean Payton reportedly said he traded back into Round 7 to draft Stevens because the Panthers had agreed to an undrafted free agent deal with him.
Having undrafted free agent deals in place with players during the NFL Draft is prohibited by league rules, though. So, this could be an issue.
“The rules in this regard are clear, and they were reiterated in the April 21 memo from the league’s player personnel department. Once the draft begins, teams that aren’t on the clock can speak to representatives of players who were not yet drafted, but those conversations must focus only on non-financial matters,” ProFootballTalk wrote.
“Payton’s account of the events that led to the Saints eventually trading back into round seven and drafting Stevens shows that both the Saints and Panthers violated the rules by discussing financial matters and making financial offers to Stevens while the draft was still unfolding.”
The Panthers have since denied having a deal in place with Stevens. A Carolina spokesman said the team simply had conversations with the quarterback.
“We didn’t have a deal in place with the player,” Panthers spokesman Steve Drummond told PFT. “We had conversations like every other team.”
Teams having unofficial deals in place with soon-to-be undrafted players is probably somewhat common, but this one leaked to the media, so the NFL might have to step in.
Stevens, 23, had 934 passing yards, 310 rushing yards, 12 total touchdowns and five interceptions in his lone season at Mississippi State in 2019. He began his career at Penn State.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Panthers deny having deal with QB Stevens</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Despite the New Orleans Saints’ claims to the contrary, the Carolina Panthers say they didn’t have a contract agreement in place with Mississippi State quarterback Tommy Stevens before he was drafted by New Orleans.
Panthers spokesman Steve Drummond told Pro Football Talk via text massage on Saturday, “We didn’t have a deal in place with the player. We had conversations like every other team.”
Rules allow teams to talk to players during the draft — about potentially joining them should the player go undrafted — but financial terms cannot be discussed. Reports every year, however, indicate the rule is regularly broken.
Saints head coach Sean Payton detailed to The Athletic earlier this week how his team and the Panthers had both been negotiating for Stevens’ services, saying Carolina had offered Stevens a $15,000 signing bonus and a $30,000 guarantee of his salary.
Payton said the Saints — who traded all of their remaining draft picks before the fourth round began — pushed their guarantee up to $144,000, but Stevens had already made a commitment to the Panthers. Rather than trying to negotiate further, New Orleans traded a 2021 sixth-round pick to Houston for the 240th overall pick and simply drafted Stevens.
“I said, ‘Honestly, I was having some fun,’” Payton said. “‘You had given your word, and I respect that. But we weren’t going to lose you. You were going to become a Saint.’”
Stevens, who is 6-foot-5, 235, is expected to play other positions in the mold of Saints utility man Taysom Hill.
Panthers offensive coordinator Joe Brady coached Stevens at Penn State, then joined the Saints’ coaching staff for two years before spending last year at LSU, helping the Tigers to an undefeated season and the national title.

The Saints have outed the Panthers as having a deal in place to sign Mississippi State quarterback Tommy Stevens, if Stevens went undrafted. The disclosure could land both teams in hot water.
The Panthers are doing their best to escape the boiling pot.
“We didn’t have a deal in place with the player,” Panthers spokesman Steve Drummond told PFT via text message. “We had conversations like every other team.”
Conversations during the draft with players who may not be drafted are permitted. Financial terms can’t be discussed, however. Although it happens all the time, the league emphasized this point in a pre-draft memo sent to all teams.
The Saints claim that they traded back into round seven in order to disrupt the deal that the Panthers struck with Stevens to sign a contract as an undrafted free agent.
The league has declined comment on the situation. At least one league source has predicted that both teams will be punished. The reality remains that every team talks numbers with potential undrafted free agents, during every draft. Like pre-free agency tampering or fudging injury reports, everyone does it — and very few get whacked for it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ex-MLB All-Star Keough dies at 64</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former All-Star pitcher Matt Keough died Saturday of undisclosed causes. He was 64.
He had been serving as a special assistant with the Oakland Athletics, who announced his death.
Keough was a second-generation major leaguer; his father, Marty Keough, played 11 seasons in the majors from 1956-66.
The younger Keough broke in with the A’s in 1978 and earned his only All-Star selection that season. He pitched with the A’s until 1983, then went on to pitch for the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros.
“Matt was a great baseball man and a proud Oakland A,” executive vice president of baseball operations Billy Beane said in a statement. “He had an incredible passion for the game and we were lucky to have him and his wealth of knowledge alongside us for the years he worked as a special assistant. He left an unforgettable impression on everyone he touched in baseball. Our sincere condolences are with the entire Keough family tonight.””
Keough, who grew up in Southern California, finished his career with a 58-84 record and a 4.17 ERA in 215 games, 175 of them as a starter.
After his final MLB season in 1986, Keough played four seasons in Japan. The right-hander attempted a comeback with the California Angels in 1992, and while sitting in the dugout during a spring training game, he was hit in the temple by a foul ball. He required brain surgery and never played again.
To the younger generation, he is best known for his appearances on “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” which followed his life with wife, Jeana, and their three children, Shane, Kara and Colton. The show debuted in 2005, and the Keough family was prominently featured for the first five years.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OAKLAND, Calif. — Matt Keough, the former Oakland Athletics pitcher and special assistant, has died. He was 64.

He left an unforgettable impression on everyone he touched in baseball. Our sincere condolences are with the entire Keough family tonight.”
Keough was an American League All-Star as a rookie in 1978 and was selected AL Comeback Player of the Year in 1980. He was 58-84 with a 4.17 ERA with Oakland (1977-83), the New York Yankees (1983), St. Louis (1985), Chicago Cubs (1986) and Houston (1986), then went 45-44 with a 3/73 ERA in Japan with Hanshin (1987-90).
Keough’s father, Marty and uncle, Joe, were major league outfielders.

"He had an incredible passion for the game and we were lucky to have him and his wealth of knowledge alongside us for the years he worked as a special assistant."
Keough also played for the New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, St Louis Cardinals and Houston Astros before pitching in Japan from 1987-1990.
After his playing career, Keough served in front-office roles with the Los Angeles Angels and Tampa Bay Devil Rays – now known as the Tampa Bay Rays – in addition to the A's.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OAKLAND, Calif. — Matt Keough, the former Oakland Athletics pitcher and special assistant, has died. He was 64.
The Athletics announced the death Saturday night without providing details.
“Matt was a great baseball man and a proud Oakland A,” Billy Beane, the team’s executive vice-president of baseball operations, said in a statement.
“He had an incredible passion for the game and we were lucky to have him and his wealth of knowledge alongside us for the years he worked as a special assistant. He left an unforgettable impression on everyone he touched in baseball. Our sincere condolences are with the entire Keough family tonight.”
Keough was an American League All-Star as a rookie in 1978 and was selected AL Comeback Player of the Year in 1980. He was 58-84 with a 4.17 ERA with Oakland (1977-83), the New York Yankees (1983), St. Louis (1985), Chicago Cubs (1986) and Houston (1986), then went 45-44 with a 3/73 ERA in Japan with Hanshin (1987-90).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Matt Keough, Former Oakland A’s Once-Promising Ace, Dies At 64</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Matt Keough, a 1978 American League All-Star and the 1980 American League Comeback Player of the Year, died May 2, 2020. He was 64.
Keough cut his teeth with the Oakland Athletics in 1977 after being converted from an infielder to a pitcher. He played seven of his nine big league seasons with Oakland, and later worked for the team as a coach an executive from 1992-1999. The team released a statement shortly after his death acknowledging his organizational work.
"Matt was a great baseball man and a proud Oakland A," said A’s Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations Billy Beane. "He had an incredible passion for the game and we were lucky to have him and his wealth of knowledge alongside us for the years he worked as a Special Assistant. He left an unforgettable impression on everyone he touched in baseball. Our sincere condolences are with the entire Keough family tonight."
Keough was part of an overworked young staff that threw 90 complete games during 1980. Speaking with the New York Times NYT in 1999, Keough explained Billy Martin's philosophy for letting their fresh arms go the distance.
"He used to tell us don't even look at the bullpen; there won't be anyone down there," Keough said to the New York Times. "Billy's whole philosophy was, why should I bring in someone from the bullpen, lefty or righty, when they're not as good as the guys I have on the mound now?"
Eventually their workhorse staff wore down and suffered career-altering arm injuries. While many in the media pointed to Martin's carelessness, Keough thought it was not all Martin's doing; their naiveté played a role as well.
"Everybody looks at it as negative," he said, "but Billy didn't get us hurt. I don't think the complete games caused the injuries, the way we were used. ... After we got hurt, Billy convinced us to keep pitching. Our egos bought into it."
Keough found a second chance in Japan after pitching for the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros. With MLB owners colluding against free agents, a $500,000 offer in 1987 from the Hanshin Tigers swayed him to follow his father Marty's footsteps playing in a foreign country.
"We’re the first (American) father-son team to have played in Japan, and a lot of Japanese fans mention to me how they remember Dad over here," Keough said to the Los Angeles Times in 1988.
He pitched four seasons in Japan, becoming at the time, the last former MLB pitcher to win double digit games in Japan. He shared his secrets for success in Japan during a time when many American players struggled overseas.
"The key to being happy over here is to arrive with the attitude that you’re not going to be playing American baseball here," he said. "A lot of guys, they’ve come over here and fought changes, had the attitude that, 'This is how I did it in the States, and this is how I’m going to do it here.'"
One interesting tidbit Keough shared about playing in Japan was the technology teams used to get an advantage on their opponents. Note how 30 years later, the methods Keough said were used in Japan were very similar to the Houston Astros’ tactics.
“Stealing signs, strategy . . . the thinking part of the game is emphasized a lot more here,” he said. “The starting pitchers are not announced before the lineup cards are exchanged at home plate. All the clubs have video cameras and guys with binoculars in the scoreboards, the dugouts . . . all the dugouts have TV monitors.”
He tried comebacks with the California Angels in 1991 and 1992, with the latter ending in a serious injury that altered the rest of his life. While sitting in the dugout during a spring training game, he was hit in the head by a foul ball. Emergency cranial surgery saved Keough’s life, but he battled substance abuse as he coped with his brain trauma.
His problems played out publicly on the television show, “The Real Housewives of Orange County” where his wife Jeana was a featured star. Speaking with People Magazine in 2019, his estranged wife explained how his injury splintered their relationship.
“The minute he got injured in 1992, he was not the same person. From 1992, he woke up, he didn’t like me,” she said. “I’m kind of not what he wants. He needs peace and quiet and I had a house full of crazy kids and their friends … and he’s been alone for a long time. He prefers the company of himself.”
Keough was sentenced in 2010 to one year in jail for drunk driving. He is survived by his three children, Shane, Kara and Colton. His eldest child Shane played four minor league seasons with the A’s.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Horse racing: Secretariat wins Triple Crown showdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Secretariat found his stride down the stretch and emerged victorious on Saturday in a computer-simulated Kentucky Derby, which pitted all of horse racing’s 13 Triple Crown winners against each other.
Seattle Slew led for most of the race but had to settle for third after being overtaken by the victorious chestnut stallion, who won the Triple Crown in 1973 and whose story inspired a Disney film in 2010.
Citation, who won the Triple Crown in 1948 and was the first race horse to earn $1 million, came in second.
The Triple Crown consists of the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes and was most recently won by Justify in 2018.
Horse racing has gone online as the coronavirus crisis forces the cancellation or postponement of meetings, including this month’s Grand National in Britain, which was also turned into a virtual race instead.
With the Kentucky Derby forced from its traditional first Saturday in May by the coronavirus outbreak, the first jewel of horse racing’s real Triple Crown was postponed until Sept. 5.
Churchill Downs, which is home to the Kentucky Derby, said it was hoping to raise $2 million for COVID-19 emergency relief from the race, which utilized data algorithms to help determine the probability of their potential finishing positions.
Churchill Downs on Thursday said it will open for spectator-free racing on May 16 under strict guidelines to mitigate risks from the COVID-19 pandemic.
It added that it hopes to have fans in attendance for its famous race in September.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Weidman: ‘I’m a bad matchup for Israel Adesanya’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s been a tough five years for former UFC middleweight champion Chris Weidman. After dethroning the former GOAT contender Anderson Silva in 2013 and defending his belt three times, he dropped the strap to Luke Rockhold in 2015 in what would be the start of a 1-5 slide punctuated by long injury stints. An attempted move up to light heavyweight lasted less than two minutes, but the NCAA championship medalist has high hopes for his next run at 185 pounds.
It’s still unclear who he’ll fight first. A fight against Jack Hermansson on May 2nd was scuttled due to the Coronavirus pandemic, and The Chris recently revealed he’d accepted several tough replacement opponents including Yoel Romero and Edmen Shahbazyan before those matches failed to materialize as well. Whoever Weidman faces, he made it clear in an interview with MMA Fighting that he has his eye on current champion Israel Adesanya, and he thinks his performances against common opponents proves he’d be quite the challenge for the flashy “Stylebender.”
“Obviously, I’m coming off losses,” Weidman conceded. “I don’t want to talk too much, but it is a really good matchup for me. Obviously, I got knocked out by Yoel Romero, and he didn’t, but I engaged a lot more [than Adesanya]. His other fights, if you compare my fight with Kelvin Gastelum, I pretty much dominated that fight and then finished him. I finished Anderson Silva twice, and he had a close fight with him, too.”
“I just think matchup wise, everything is about matchups, and I think I’m a bad matchup for him. A guy who could get him down and control him. I’m very dangerous with submissions as well, and knock him out at the same time. I would love to get that opportunity, and right now I’m far away, at least in my eyes. I’ve got some serious work to do. But that is the end goal.”
Weidman’s winning performance against Kelvin Gastelum in 2017 proves he still has fuel left in his career’s gas tank, but the laundry list of injuries he’s suffered makes it hard not to question how much. Issues with his knees and vertebrae have plagued him since 2014, and a less than successful surgery on his hand took over a year to properly rehab.
You kind of need all of those body parts working well to climb a contender’s ladder as challenging as the middleweight one, but Weidman sounds ready to try it with his sights set all the way at the top. Let’s hope this run lasts longer than the one minute forty three seconds of his light heavyweight run.
What do you think, Maniacs? Is Chris still your boy or is this just too much to ask of the 35 year old veteran?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Weidman: ‘I’m a bad matchup’ for future ‘legend’ Israel Adesanya</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chris Weidman is back at the division he once reigned as champion for good. Even though Weidman admits he’s long away from a title shot, he still thinks he’s a ‘bad matchup’ for champ Israel Adesanya.
Weidman (14-5) is moving back to 185-pounds after an unsuccessful one fight stint at light heavyweight, being knocked out by Dominick Reyes in the first-round. The former champion has suffered knockout losses to the likes of Yoel Romero and Jacare Souza and is 1-5 in his last six fights.
Talking recently to MMA Fighting, Weidman said his drop back down to middleweight should be permanent.
“That’s the plan, I think,” Weidman said. “We’ll see, but I think I’m used to being there and my move to 205 [pounds] didn’t go my way at all. I really couldn’t take anything out of that fight. I feel great against 205 pounders, sparring them, and I know I could be right there with all those guys. But it just so happened in my fight [that] I got caught early. So it was hard to take anything out of it.”
“The All American” continued by praising the current UFC middleweight champion Adesanya. Weidman thinks that “The Last Stylebender” will be viewed as a “legend in the sport” once he’s done with MMA, he also discussed why he thinks he’s cause problems for the undefeated middleweight.
“I think he’ll be looked at as a guy who’s like a legend in the sport when it’s all said and done – at least in the middleweight division.
“I just think matchup wise, everything is about matchups, and I think I’m a bad matchup for him. A guy who could get him down and control him. I’m very dangerous with submissions as well, and [I could] knock him out at the same time. I would love to get that opportunity, and right now I’m far away, at least in my eyes. I’ve got some serious work to do. But that is the end goal.”
Weidman was scheduled to fight Jack Hermansson at UFC Oklahoma City on May 2nd but the event was cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak. The fight hasn’t yet been rescheduled.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UFC 249 Stats Preview: Head-To-Head Look At Greg Hardy Vs. Yorgan De Castro</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Saturday’s UFC 249 pay-per-view fight card opens with a pair of heavyweight sluggers who have combined for 10 knockout victories in their brief MMA careers.
Former NFL player, Greg Hardy, looks to bounce back from the second defeat of his career against the unbeaten Yorgan De Castro.
Hardy is coming off a decision loss to Alexander Volkov in November. Before that setback, Hardy had a decision win overturned to a no contest when the Massachusetts State Athletic Commission ruled the inhaler Hardy used prior to the start of the third round of his October bout opposite Ben Sosoli was not pre-approved by the athletic commission. Hardy’s most recent win was a July 2019 knockout of Juan Adams. Hardy’s career record is 5-1-0-1.
De Castro, who is 6-0 with five knockout victories, scored a first-round knockout win of Justin Tafa in October. The stoppage came in De Castro’s UFC debut. De Castro earned a $50,000 “Performance of the Night” bonus for his efforts on the UFC 243 pay-per-view card. 
Expect this bout to take place on the feet as neither of these men have shot for a takedown during their UFC careers. 
De Castro told MMA Junkie that he wanted to face Hardy for his second trip to the octagon.
“I specifically asked for this fight,” De Castro said. “This is the fight I wanted. I wanted to fight Greg Hardy. Not because of all the bad stuff around him, or the hate or the negative things, but because he’s got a name. A lot of people hate him, a lot of people like him, but he does have a name, and he just fought a top guy and he did good. If I want to fight someone who has got a name and a lot of people want to watch and is not ranked, what else is better than Greg Hardy? I specifically asked for him.”
Hardy expects a win over De Castro to put him in line for a top-15 opponent.
“I think we start with 15 and go down the line,” Hardy told TMZ. “Fifteen fights later, I knock out the guy who’s holding the belt – whoever that is. You get the best show like that. Go down the whole line so everybody can just shush, calm down, wait their turn, and get knocked the crap out. I think it would be one, give me more time to get more experience with the best, which is what I need.
Before Hardy and De Castro face off, here is a look at how their UFC career stats compare. 
UFC 249 takes place at VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, Florida. The main card streams on ESPN+ pay-per-view following prelims on ESPN and ESPN+.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Weidman ready to climb ladder again, show he’s ‘bad matchup’ for Israel Adesanya</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chris Weidman has no illusions about his standing in the middleweight division as he plans his return to 185 pounds.
After a brief move to 205 pounds last year that ended in a knockout loss to Dominick Reyes, Weidman ultimately decided middleweight is the better fit. Deep down, the former champion knows he could still make waves at light heavyweight, but he also understands that competing at 185 pounds is probably better for his long term goals.
“That’s the plan, I think,” Weidman told MMA Fighting regarding a permanent move back to middleweight. “We’ll see, but I think I’m used to being there and my move to 205 [pounds] didn’t go my way at all. I really couldn’t take anything out of that fight. I feel great against 205 pounders, sparring them, and I know I could be right there with all those guys. But it just so happened in my fight [that] I got caught early. So it was hard to take anything out of it.
“I’m going to go back to 185, where I already know there’s a lot of questions.”
Weidman originally was slated to face Jack Hermansson in the main event of UFC Fight Night in Oklahoma City, but the card was canceled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. After Hermansson was ruled out due to new travel restrictions, he entertained several potential replacements, including a showdown with top middleweight prospect Edmen Shahbazyan.
With a 1-5 record in his past six fights, including five losses by KO or TKO, Weidman isn’t making any demands about his path as a middleweight. He knows he isn’t in a position to demand fights that will guarantee him a shot at the title, but he also understands several middleweight contenders would welcome a chance to face a former champion.
In the long run, Weidman hopes those fights will eventually lead him to his ultimate goal — a fight against reigning middleweight champion Israel Adesanya.
“I think the guy’s super talented,” Weidman said. “He’s the new champion. He’s got the star power, and when I’m all said and done with my career, I really want to fight the best guys in the history of the middleweight division. I think I’ve done that, and Israel’s one of those guys I haven’t got to fight yet.
“He’s growing to become one of those guys. [I’m] seeing if he can defend his belt a couple of times, but I’d love to test myself against him. So whoever I’ve got to fight before that to get to a fight like that is definitely motivating.”
Adesanya has definitely injected excitement into the middleweight division, which has shined a brighter light on all fighters at 185 pounds. But Weidman isn’t ready to anoint the champ as one of the best fighters of all time.
“Listen, he’s got a lot of work ahead of him for sure,” Weidman said. “Anderson Silva, he dominated everybody for years. He didn’t have wars like [Israel] has been having. He had a close fight with Anderson Silva, and this was years after I fought Anderson Silva. He had a very, very close barnburner fight with Kelvin Gastelum. The fight with Yoel Romero was obviously just terrible, but he’s exciting to watch.
“He’s got a good mouthpiece on him. He’s a smart kid. He’s fun to listen to him talk. I don’t know if he’s going to be beating Anderson Silva’s record or anything like that, but I think he’ll be looked at as a guy who’s like a legend in the sport when it’s all said and done – at least in the middleweight division.”
The last thing Weidman wants right now is the perception that he’s somehow calling out the current middleweight champion when he’s coming off back-to-back losses. The New York native knows there’s a long road to travel before getting back to title contention, but at the same time, he can’t deny how much he’d love to land that fight in the future.
“Obviously, I’m coming off losses,” Weidman said. “I don’t want to talk too much, but it is a really good matchup for me. Obviously, I got knocked out by Yoel Romero, and he didn’t, but I engaged a lot more. His other fights, if you compare my fight with Kelvin Gastelum, I pretty much dominated that fight and then finished him. I finished Anderson Silva twice, and he had a close fight with him, too.
“I just think matchup wise, everything is about matchups, and I think I’m a bad matchup for him. A guy who could get him down and control him. I’m very dangerous with submissions as well, and [I could] knock him out at the same time. I would love to get that opportunity, and right now I’m far away, at least in my eyes. I’ve got some serious work to do. But that is the end goal.”
Right now, Weidman is just ready to get back to work. He aims to a return to the win column and shift the perception that he’s somehow past his prime. It wasn’t that long ago he was considered the best middleweight in the sport, and he’s eager to prove himself yet again.
“That’s the game we’re in because the low’s the low – you know,” Weidman said. “Nothing you can do now. These guys think you suck because you lost a fight. When you win, you’re the man.
“But you’re always looking forward, because even a win, you’ll have your haters. It’s always your turn to shut them up. It’s the sport we love.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Charlatan, Nadal give Bob Baffert sweep in Arkansas Derby | Honolulu Star-Advertiser</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HOT SPRINGS, Ark. >> Charlatan romped to victory by six lengths in the first division of the Arkansas Derby and Nadal won the second division by three lengths, giving Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert a sweep today when the Kentucky Derby was postponed.
The 146th Derby usually would have dominated the first Saturday in May, but it was pushed back to Sept. 5 by the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, 20 3-year-olds ran in two divisions of the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn, each worth $500,000. Each race was worth 170 qualifying points for the Kentucky Derby, including 100 to the winners. It was the first time since 1960 that the race was split.
No fans were allowed because of the pandemic on a day that would have been the biggest of the season at Oaklawn.
Charlatan improved to 3-0 after not racing at age 2. His first two wins by a combined 16 lengths came at Santa Anita, where the colt is based. He broke from the No. 1 post in the 1 1/8-mile race under Martin Garcia, who was replacing Drayden Van Dyke for the race. Charlatan was timed in 1:48.49 and paid $2.80 to win.
“He did in all within himself,” Garcia said. “I felt someone coming at the three-eighths (pole) and I let him go. He just took off. That’s a sign of a really good horse.”
Basin finished second and Gouverneur Morris was another neck back in third. Winning Impression finished fourth.
Nadal, named for tennis star Rafael Nadal, won his division in 1:48.34. He paid $3.80 to win. He is 4-0 in his young career and moved to the top of the Kentucky Derby leaderboard with 150 points.
“He looked good; very good race,” winning jockey Joel Rosario said. “He’s a champ.”
King Guillermo, owned by former major league catcher Victor Martinez, finished second. Finnick the Fierce, a 60-1 shot, was third.
It was Baffert’s third win in the Arkansas Derby.
“I thought both horses were going to run really well,” Baffert said. “Charlatan, what a talent he is and how fast he is. Nadal, he’s a tough horse. There’s a lot to him and he’s a cool customer, and I could see he’s getting better and better.”
The race was supposed to be on April 11, but Oaklawn reworked its stakes schedule to run it on closing day today and split it into divisions because of the large number of horses that were entered.

Charlatan earns victory in Arkansas Derby 1st division
Charlatan romped in the first division of the Arkansas Derby, leading all the way to win a race pushed back three weeks to help fill a void when the Kentucky Derby was postponed until September.
The 146th Derby usually would have dominated the first Saturday in May, but it was postponed by the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, 21 3-year-olds ran in two divisions of the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn, each worth $500,000. She was worth 170 qualifying points for the Kentucky Derby, including 100 to the winners.

Secretariat wins virtual Kentucky Derby's Triple Crown Showdown
Forty-seven years after his record-setting Kentucky Derby triumph, Secretariat once again ruled the first Saturday in May — virtually speaking at least.
In a computer-generated matchup of all 13 Triple Crown winners put together by Inspired Entertainment, Secretariat rallied five-wide and beat Citation by a half-length to capture the Kentucky Derby Triple Crown Showdown.
The virtual race was broadcast as part of NBC’s Kentucky Derby coverage on a day when there was no Kentucky Derby. The race has been postponed until Sept. 5 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Seattle Slew led the way heading for home before Secretariat — the 7-2 favorite — and jockey Ron Turcotte made their move down the middle of the track. Citation (1948 Triple Crown winner) and jockey Eddie Arcaro shot down the rail but couldn’t match Secretariat.
Seattle Slew was third and was followed by Affirmed, American Pharoah, Whirlaway, Justify, Count Fleet, Assault, War Admiral, Omaha, Gallant Fox and Sir Barton.
The Virginia-bred Secretariat won the 1973 Kentucky Derby in a time of 1:59 2/5 seconds, a record that still stands today.
MLB
Marlins manager Mattingly reveals truth behind birthday mystery
Fact: Don Mattingly was born on April 20, 1961. So why, for so long, did baseball writers and fans believe his birthday to be April 20, 1962? Sure, some of his baseball cards said as much — the 1987 Topps edition actually went so far as to say the '61 birth date was incorrect.
ESPN ran a lengthy story this week examining how the 1962 date of birth became printed and accepted. But on Friday, Mattingly offered his version of how the age change came to be.
"I think I'm 21 or something, and the writers in New York, they're always around," Mattingly began in a video from a Q&A session for his charity that was posted online. "And they're like, 'Oh, you're going to be 22.' And I'm like, 'No, I'm going to be 21. Dude, I'm 20, I'm gonna be 21.' So you know you always want to get younger, right?"
The reporters challenged Mattingly to provide proof. So he photocopied his original certificate, whited out "61" and wrote "62" over it, photocopied that copy, and then showed it to the media.
COLLEGE FOOTBALL
Kansas, Missouri renew Border War
Kansas and Missouri are resuming their bitter Border War in football after the former Big 12 rivals agreed to a four-game series in which each school will play two home games beginning in September 2025.
The fourth-longest rivalry in college football dates to 1891, but it has been on hiatus since Missouri departed for the Southeastern Conference. The schools recently announced a six-game series in men's basketball beginning with the upcoming season that includes two games on each campus and two in Kansas City, Missouri.
The second football game between the Jayhawks and Tigers will take place in 2026 in Lawrence. The third will happen in Columbia in 2031 before the series concludes the following season in Lawrence.
Missouri leads the series 56-55-9 after winning the most recent matchup at Arrowhead Stadium on Nov. 25, 2011.
SOCCER
Joe Biden tells USWNT to keep fighting for equal pay
After a federal judge in California on Friday threw out the U.S. women's national soccer team's claim of unequal pay compared to the men's team, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden tweeted his support of the women.
"Don't give up this fight," read a tweet posted on Biden's official account on Saturday. "This is not over yet."
The former vice president also called out U.S. Soccer and laid out in plain terms what the consequences would be if the organization did not pony up for equal pay.
"Equal pay, now," Biden tweeted. "Or else when I'm president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding."
Friday's ruling, made in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California by Judge R. Gary Klausner, ruled that a discrimination claim related to unequal working conditions — specifically, the use of charter flights — may proceed to trial.

The 146th Derby usually would have dominated the first Saturday in May, but it was postponed by the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, 21 3-year-olds ran in two divisions of the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn, each worth $500,000. She was worth 170 qualifying points for the Kentucky Derby, including 100 to the winners.
Charlatan improved to 3-0. His first two wins came at Santa Anita, where the colt is based. He broke from the No. 1 post in the 1 1/8-mile race under Martin Garcia, who was replacing Drayden Van Dyke for the race. Charlatan was timed in 1:48.49.
Basin finished second and Gouverneur Morris was third.
The Arkansas Derby was supposed to be run April 11, but Oaklawn reworked its stakes schedule to run it on closing day Saturday.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HOT SPRINGS, Ark. -- Charlatan romped to victory by six lengths in the first division of the Arkansas Derby, and Nadal won the second division, giving Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert a sweep on Saturday when the Kentucky Derby was postponed.
The 146th Kentucky Derby usually would have dominated the first Saturday in May, but it was pushed back to Sept. 5 by the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, 18 3-year-olds ran in two divisions of the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn, each worth $500,000. Each race was worth 170 qualifying points for the Kentucky Derby, including 100 to the winners. It was the first time since 1960 that the race was split.
No fans were allowed because of the pandemic on a day that would have been the biggest of the season at Oaklawn.
Charlatan improved to 3-0 after not racing at age 2. (His first two wins by a combined 16 lengths came at California's Santa Anita Park, where the colt is based.) He broke from the No. 1 post in the 1 1/8-mile race under Martin Garcia, who was replacing Drayden Van Dyke for the race. Charlatan was timed in 1:48.49 and paid $2.80 to win.
"He did it all within himself," Garcia said. "I felt someone coming at the three-eighths [pole], and I let him go. He just took off. That's a sign of a really good horse."
Basin finished second, and Gouverneur Morris was another neck back in third. Winning Impression finished fourth.
Nadal, named for tennis star Rafael Nadal, won his division in 1:48.34. He is 4-0 in his young career.
"He looked good, very good race," winning jockey Joel Rosario said. "He's a champ."
King Guillermo, owned by former major league catcher Victor Martinez, a five-time All-Star, finished second. Finnick the Fierce, a 60-1 shot, was third.
It was Baffert's third win in the Arkansas Derby.
"I thought both horses were going to run really well," Baffert said. "Charlatan, what a talent he is and how fast he is. Nadal, he's a tough horse. There's a lot to him and he's a cool customer, and I could see he's getting better and better."
The race was supposed to be on April 11, but Oaklawn reworked its stakes schedule to run it on closing day Saturday and split it into divisions because of the large number of horses that were entered.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Horse racing: Undefeated Nadal is good, but is he a Charlatan?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Is Nadal good enough to beat a Charlatan?
That was the question fans were asking after the two horses were separated into different races at the Arkansas Derby on Saturday.
With the Kentucky Derby, usually run on the first Saturday of May, postponed until September due to the coronavirus, the $1 million Arkansas Derby took centre stage, albeit without spectators on what is usually the biggest day on the American horse racing calendar.
The race over 1 1/8 miles (1,810 metres) for three-year-olds at Hot Springs was divided into two divisions and Charlatan, ridden by Martin Garcia, led all the way to convincingly win the first by six lengths.
But Nadal, named after the tennis player, was equally impressive in the second flight.
Jockey Joel Rosario guided the colt into the lead around the top turn on the Oaklawn Park dirt before pulling away to triumph by three lengths in one minute, 48.34 seconds, marginally faster than Charlatan’s 1:48.49.
Both winners, trained by Bob Baffert, remain unbeaten.
“He’s a champ,” Rosario said of Nadal.
He was speaking of the horse, though he could well have been talking about the 19-times grand slam champion.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Football finance expert paints bleak picture for lower league clubs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Football finance expert Kieran Maguire says lower league clubs have been “taken out at the knees” by the coronavirus pandemic, having seen income streams dry up as the possibility of empty stands until 2021 looms large.
Sport, like all industries, is scrambling to get a grip on the Covid-19 crisis, which has led to the decimation of the sporting calendar and pressure increasing on clubs and organisations.
The Premier League is working towards a mid-June return, but there remains plenty of unanswered questions in the EFL as leagues and clubs attempt to navigate through these choppy waters.
There have been countless warnings about clubs going to the wall and League Two side Bradford revealed on Friday they had been informed that there is the “ever-growing possibility of supporters being unable to attend matches until 2021”.
A lack of matchday income for that length of time would irreparably hurt some clubs and Maguire, a lecturer in football finance at the University of Liverpool, paints a bleak overall picture amid this uncertain backdrop.
“The clubs in the lower leagues, most of them have got fairly precarious finances to begin with and have operating on a week-to-week basis in terms of meeting their financial obligations, paying the rent, paying the wage bill, paying the council tax and so on,” he told the PA news agency.
“And that’s during a season when they were having regular fixtures.
“Both Macclesfield and Southend failed to pay wages in February. Oldham didn’t pay their March wages until, I think, two days ago, so there’s a backlog in terms of wages being paid.
“How clubs can address that is beyond me if there is no money coming in through the turnstiles, which accounts for around 40 to 50 per cent of total income for some League One and League Two clubs.
“In terms of the TV deal, I think Sky have been pretty generous to date. But for 2021, they’ve got to have a product before they can pay.
“It’s not fair on them because they’ve got no subscribers themselves. They’ve effectively given everybody a subscription holiday, so their income flows are being impacted.
“Until the EFL have a product which is watchable, then the broadcasters aren’t going to pay for it.
“Matchday income – nothing until we resume. TV – undecided until we’ve got some form of football taking place. And then the third form of income for clubs is sponsors – well, you can’t sponsor a football match which isn’t taking place.
“The industry has been effectively taken out at the knees as a result of the pandemic.”
If the supporter shutout does last the rest of the year, Leyton Orient chief executive Danny Macklin believes income from streaming games could save some EFL clubs.
Clubs currently get 80 per cent of subscriptions to the EFL’s iFollow platform and Maguire believes Sky Sports, UK rights holders, would be flexible enough to negotiate an agreement on that as “they can see the big picture”.
But while that might help plug the gap in League One and Two, already huge losses in the Championship would surely only increase given the current situation.
“The game was living at the edge before the pandemic,” Maguire, the author of ‘The Price of Football’, said.
“If you take a look at the losses in the Championship – there’s a couple of clubs that haven’t published their results, Sheffield Wednesday and Derby – I think we’re looking probably at a cumulative operating loss of around about £650million in the Championship.
“That’s not a sustainable business model unless you have sugar daddies, who are prepared to write out those cheques for £20-30million a year – which to give them credit, most of them have been keen to do for reasons nobody has ever quite managed to fathom out why.
“But if we now move to a situation where there’s no money coming in, those losses of £20-30 million a year in the Championship could easily extend.
“And we will find the sugar daddy owners, they don’t have income in because a lot of them are operating in other industries and there are huge losers, especially in the service sector, in terms of the ability of organisations to make money.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Football finance expert paints bleak picture for lower league clubs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic has decimated the sporting calendar.
Football finance expert Kieran Maguire says lower league clubs have been “taken out at the knees” by the coronavirus pandemic, having seen income streams dry up as the possibility of empty stands until 2021 looms large.
Sport, like all industries, is scrambling to get a grip on the Covid-19 crisis, which has led to the decimation of the sporting calendar and pressure increasing on clubs and organisations.
The Premier League is working towards a mid-June return, but there remains plenty of unanswered questions in the EFL as leagues and clubs attempt to navigate through these choppy waters.
There have been countless warnings about clubs going to the wall and League Two side Bradford revealed on Friday they had been informed that there is the “ever-growing possibility of supporters being unable to attend matches until 2021”.
A lack of matchday income for that length of time would irreparably hurt some clubs and Maguire, a lecturer in football finance at the University of Liverpool, paints a bleak overall picture amid this uncertain backdrop.
“The clubs in the lower leagues, most of them have got fairly precarious finances to begin with and have operating on a week-to-week basis in terms of meeting their financial obligations, paying the rent, paying the wage bill, paying the council tax and so on,” he told the PA news agency.
“And that’s during a season when they were having regular fixtures.
“Both Macclesfield and Southend failed to pay wages in February. Oldham didn’t pay their March wages until, I think, two days ago, so there’s a backlog in terms of wages being paid.
“How clubs can address that is beyond me if there is no money coming in through the turnstiles, which accounts for around 40 to 50 per cent of total income for some League One and League Two clubs.
“In terms of the TV deal, I think Sky have been pretty generous to date. But for 2021, they’ve got to have a product before they can pay.
“It’s not fair on them because they’ve got no subscribers themselves. They’ve effectively given everybody a subscription holiday, so their income flows are being impacted.
“Until the EFL have a product which is watchable, then the broadcasters aren’t going to pay for it.
“Matchday income – nothing until we resume. TV – undecided until we’ve got some form of football taking place. And then the third form of income for clubs is sponsors – well, you can’t sponsor a football match which isn’t taking place.
“The industry has been effectively taken out at the knees as a result of the pandemic.”
If the supporter shutout does last the rest of the year, Leyton Orient chief executive Danny Macklin believes income from streaming games could save some EFL clubs.
Clubs currently get 80 per cent of subscriptions to the EFL’s iFollow platform and Maguire believes Sky Sports, UK rights holders, would be flexible enough to negotiate an agreement on that as “they can see the big picture”.
But while that might help plug the gap in League One and Two, already huge losses in the Championship would surely only increase given the current situation.
“The game was living at the edge before the pandemic,” Maguire, the author of ‘The Price of Football’, said.
“If you take a look at the losses in the Championship – there’s a couple of clubs that haven’t published their results, Sheffield Wednesday and Derby – I think we’re looking probably at a cumulative operating loss of around about £650million in the Championship.
“That’s not a sustainable business model unless you have sugar daddies, who are prepared to write out those cheques for £20-30million a year – which to give them credit, most of them have been keen to do for reasons nobody has ever quite managed to fathom out why.
“But if we now move to a situation where there’s no money coming in, those losses of £20-30 million a year in the Championship could easily extend.
“And we will find the sugar daddy owners, they don’t have income in because a lot of them are operating in other industries and there are huge losers, especially in the service sector, in terms of the ability of organisations to make money.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United plan to play games at Old Trafford without fans until 2021</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United chiefs are reportedly planning for football without fans at Old Trafford potentially until 2021 when the sport restarts.
Red Devils bosses fear there will be no mass gatherings allowed until next year when a vaccine may be widely available and are therefore developing a strategy to put on matches without supporters.
Their position is similar to other top clubs who are looking to cope for long spells with no fans at matches in Premier League games.
And in preparing for the worst case scenario, it’s feared that they could be forced to do so beyond February 2021, according to the Mirror.

It’s thought that allowing huge sporting crowds will be one of the last things to return to normal life amid the pandemic, with large gatherings representing a big threat to the Covid-19 crisis spiking again.
United are in a solid position financially but are factoring loss of revenue from an empty Old Trafford into future financial forecasts.
A source told the Mirror: ‘It’s highly likely there will be no spectators allowed at football games for several months until either a vaccine is available or coronavirus is brought under significant control.
‘The prospect of seeing full stadiums at Premier League grounds just isn’t going to happen anytime soon and clubs are aware of that.
‘It would be reckless if clubs didn’t budget for that happening. The realism is that the prospect of crowds returning to football is a long, long way off.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Premier League clubs have been given a massive boost to end the current season
- The sporting city of Perth, Australia has been offered to English clubs to complete the season
- It is understood that EPL teams are excited with the idea and are ready to oblige
Premier League clubs have been offered an escape route in ending the 2019-20 season in Perth, Australia.
There are 92 matches left to play in the English topflight division and a neutral ground has been suggested to clubs.
Former Man United defender Gary Neville believes the only way the season can end is to play matches behind closed doors in the overseas.

Williams has also contacted the Australian government and Ministry for Sport to get their backing for the eye-catching idea.
And it is understood that Premier League teams are happy with the idea and are ready to oblige.
Perth has four stadiums that can be used to execute the remaining matches in the English league including — Optus Stadium , Perth Oval, cricket’s WACA and Joondalup Arena.
Brummie Williams said: “I have had discussions with contacts at Premier League clubs and they like the idea.
“I have also spoken with government officials and they are enthusiastic. We are speaking again this week.
“Everybody is safe here. The government has lifted many restrictions.”
Australia has recorded just 93 COVID-19 deaths, compared to over 28,000 in the United Kingdom.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League given option to finish season in Australia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Premier League have been given an option to finish the 2019/20 season in Australia, according to a report in the Sun. 
The Premier League has been looking at options to finish the current season with reports of PL chiefs suggesting to play games at neutral venues but have run into constant setbacks.
Now, the senator of the city of Perth in Australia has reportedly backed English agent Gary Williams in his plan to finish the Premier League season in Perth, Australia with the country being one of the lesser affected by the coronavirus.
This comes shortly after Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville suggested that the Premier League could be taken overseas in order to finish the season.
Australia have reported just 93 COVID-19 related deaths and are a country which have been least affected by the deadly virus.
Speaking about taking the Premier League to Perth as cited in the Sun, Brummie Williams said:
“I have had discussions with contacts at Premier League clubs and they like the idea.
“I have also spoken with government officials and they are enthusiastic. We are speaking again this week.
“Everybody is safe here. The government has lifted many restrictions.
“We are sitting round in groups of ten, we can walk around and the beaches are open. We have had four new cases in the last ten days.”
While the Perth senator Glen Sterle as quoted in the Sun said: “I’m watching what’s happening in England with a heavy heart. We want to help.”
“We have almost no new cases. It would just be a case of some quarantine for our friends when they arrive and then we are up and running.
“When Gary first mentioned it I thought it was a wonderful idea.
“I’m glad he is getting the same response from the people in the game he has called.
“This is the centre of the sporting universe in Australia. We have fresh air and good weather. It would be ideal.” he added.
This alternative of playing the remaining games of the season in Australia certainly seems plausible for the Premier League to finish the 2019/20 season and only time will tell if PL chiefs give the move a green light.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League 'offered chance' to complete season in Australia amid coronavirus crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Premier League has reportedly been offered the chance to complete the season - by hosting the remaining 92 games in Perth, Australia.
June 12 is the new target date for resuming top-flight action after the campaign was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic.
But the league is facing a potential revolt from players who are concerned about the risk of being infected with Covid-19 and fear they could be rushed back too soon.
Premier League bosses have now been offered an alternative, however, with English agent Gary Williams proposing the rest of the campaign be staged in Perth.
Williams lives in the Western Australia capital, and according to the Sun, he has been in talks with Premier League clubs and government officials about holding all remaining fixtures in the city.
Australia has reported 93 deaths due to coronavirus, compared to more than 28,000 in the UK.
Williams said: “I have had discussions with contacts at Premier League clubs and they like the idea.
“I have also spoken with government officials and they are enthusiastic. We are speaking again this week.
“Everybody is safe here. The government has lifted many restrictions.
"We are sitting round in groups of ten, we can walk around and the beaches are open. We have had four new cases in the last ten days.”
Perth, which claims to be 'the most isolated city in the world' has four major sporting venues that could be used - the Optus Stadium (65,000 capacity), the Perth Oval (20,500), the WACA cricket ground (24,500) and Joondalup Arena (16,000).
And Williams' plan has been backed by Perth state senator Glenn Sterle, who said: “I’m watching what’s happening in England with a heavy heart. We want to help.”
“We have almost no new cases. It would just be a case of some quarantine for our friends when they arrive and then we are up and running.

    <h5 class="mb-1">William Byron scores 3rd iRacing victory of NASCAR’s series</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CHARLOTTE, N.C. — William Byron showed he’s the sharpest gamer in NASCAR’s iRacing Series with his third victory in four events.
Byron passed Timmy Hill with seven laps remaining at virtual Dover International Speedway, where NASCAR was scheduled to actually race Sunday, to win yet again on the iRacing platform. The Hendrick Motorsports driver has consistently been the best of the NASCAR professionals in simulated racing.
Alex Bowman won last week at virtual Talladega Superspeedway, so Hendrick drivers have now won four consecutive iRacing events.
“I’ve enjoyed this iRacing Series, but I’m definitely ready to get going in my real car,” Byron said. “Racing anything, whether it’s a box car or anything with an engine, is going to give you confidence if you are winning.”
He said that in all his years using iRacing, he’s never been in such competitive events since NASCAR launched the invitational esports series after the stock car series was suspended March 13.
Denny Hamlin earned the pole in qualifying, but NASCAR successfully applied an invert — a glitch last week prevented the top 10 from flipping before the race began — so Ross Chastain cycled into the top starting spot.
Hamlin had his race ruined last week when his daughter accidentally turned his simulator screen off with a remote control she was holding as he was competing. He made sure to hide all remotes before Sunday’s race, but after an incident with John Hunter Nemechek, he seemed to be deliberately wrecked by Nemechek later in retaliation.
It brought out a late caution and a restart with nine laps remaining and Hill leading Byron at the green flag.
Byron didn’t need to use a bump-and-run — the move Hill used on Byron to win the virtual race at Texas Motor Speedway — and easily passed him on the inside with seven laps remaining.
Hill finished second and was shown at times racing with his cat on his steering wheel.
“William has done a great job through this iRacing invitational,” Hill said. “I just wish I could get another win. I’ve had such tremendous support from everyone in the racing community through this; this has been a blast and really brought us all together. We’ve really had a lot of fun racing all these races, but I can’t wait to get back and see everyone’s faces.”
NASCAR will complete its iRacing Series next Saturday at North Carolina’s deserted North Wilkesboro Speedway, a track last raced by the national series in 1996. Overgrown with weeds and clearly neglected, Dale Earnhardt Jr. last year led a group of volunteers in cleaning the speedway so it could be mapped for use in iRacing.
Although the simulated version of North Wilkesboro is not yet available to the public on the iRacing platform, it will be the virtual host for NASCAR’s finale. Then it’s back to the real thing for the stock car series, which plans to resume competition without spectators starting May 17 at Darlington Raceway in South Carolina.

    <h5 class="mb-1">William Byron scores 3rd iRacing victory of NASCAR’s series</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — William Byron showed he’s the sharpest gamer in NASCAR’s iRacing Series with his third victory in four events.
Byron passed Timmy Hill with seven laps remaining at virtual Dover International Speedway, where NASCAR was scheduled to actually race Sunday, to win yet again on the iRacing platform. The Hendrick Motorsports driver has consistently been the best of the NASCAR professionals in simulated racing.
Alex Bowman won last week at virtual Talladega Superspeedway, so Hendrick drivers have now won four consecutive iRacing events.
“I’ve enjoyed this iRacing Series, but I’m definitely ready to get going in my real car,” Byron said. “Racing anything, whether it’s a box car or anything with an engine, is going to give you confidence if you are winning.”
He said that in all his years using iRacing, he’s never been in such competitive events since NASCAR launched the invitational esports series after the stock car series was suspended March 13.
Denny Hamlin earned the pole in qualifying, but NASCAR successfully applied an invert — a glitch last week prevented the top 10 from flipping before the race began — so Ross Chastain cycled into the top starting spot.

Hamlin had his race ruined last week when his daughter accidentally turned his simulator screen off with a remote control she was holding as he was competing. He made sure to hide all remotes before Sunday’s race, but after an incident with John Hunter Nemechek, he seemed to be deliberately wrecked by Nemechek later in retaliation.
It brought out a late caution and a restart with nine laps remaining and Hill leading Byron at the green flag.
Byron didn’t need to use a bump-and-run — the move Hill used on Byron to win the virtual race at Texas Motor Speedway — and easily passed him on the inside with seven laps remaining.
Hill finished second and was shown at times racing with his cat on his steering wheel.
“William has done a great job through this iRacing invitational,” Hill said. “I just wish I could get another win. I’ve had such tremendous support from everyone in the racing community through this; this has been a blast and really brought us all together. We’ve really had a lot of fun racing all these races, but I can’t wait to get back and see everyone’s faces.”
NASCAR will complete its iRacing Series next Saturday at North Carolina’s deserted North Wilkesboro Speedway, a track last raced by the national series in 1996. Overgrown with weeds and clearly neglected, Dale Earnhardt Jr. last year led a group of volunteers in cleaning the speedway so it could be mapped for use in iRacing.
Although the simulated version of North Wilkesboro is not yet available to the public on the iRacing platform, it will be the virtual host for NASCAR’s finale. Then it’s back to the real thing for the stock car series, which plans to resume competition without spectators starting May 17 at Darlington Raceway in South Carolina.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scott McLaughlin Wins On Indy Oval For 2nd Virtual Victory</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">other sports
Written By Associated Press Television News | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 03:38 IST
Scott McLaughlin was supposed to leave Australia for Indianapolis this month to make his IndyCar debut on the road course at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
With sports on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic, the two-time V8 SuperCars champion saw his IndyCar plans postponed.
McLaughlin instead settled for a virtual victory Saturday on the oval at Indianapolis Motor Speedway — his second win of IndyCar’s iRacing six-race series — after a wild finish in which most of the leaders crashed as they rushed toward the checkered flag.
“Unbelievable,” McLaughlin said. “I was literally just hoping there was going to be a wreck at the end. I thought we were going to be third, and then the three wrecked and we won.”
McLaughlin celebrated in the seat of his simulator in Australia with a glass of cold milk, a nod to the traditional victory celebration at the Indianapolis 500. He declined to pour it over his head while sitting in his expensive rig.
Formula One driver Lando Norris, winner of last week’s IndyCar virtual race, was headed for what appeared a 1-2-3 podium sweep for the Arrow McLaren SP entries on the final lap. But Norris ran into the back of Simon Pagenaud, a two-time iRacing winner and the defending Indy 500 champion, to take himself out of contention.
Then Oliver Askew and Pato O’Ward crashed, cars were sailing airborne and McLaughlin slid through the carnage to give Team Penske drivers their fourth win in the six-race series. McLaughlin and Pagenaud won twice, and Norris and Sage Karam were the other winners of this series created for content while IndyCar is on hold.
Conor Daly finished second and was followed by Santino Ferrucci, who figured there would be a lot of angry drivers after the 175-mile race.
“So many people are going to be salty over that,” Ferrucci said. “It’s a video game. Let’s try to have some fun.”
Daly, who has earned new fame through the iRacing series for his colorful commentary on his in-race stream, again delivered with one-liners and a humorous post-race speech.
“Quite a day on the internet today. It was an electric factory of a race. It was hilarious at the same time, I think we were involved in three accidents,” Daly said.
He then walked viewers through his setup from his Indianapolis home.
“I am sitting on one of four kitchen table chairs that is from downstairs. There is a mattress behind me, there’s not really much room for a simulator. My pedals are currently being supported by a box with a big, full thing of batteries on top of it because that provided some extra weight and stability. So yeah, pretty technological setup here in the Conor Daly Tech Center.”
The field of 33 gave 29 guaranteed slots to full-time IndyCar competitors, plus Norris, McLaughlin and part-time series driver Sage Karam based on their victories in previous iRacing events.
The final four slots were determined Wednesday in a special qualifying session and went to Scott Speed, Stefan Wilson, James Davison and RC Enerson. Those who tried to make the race but did not were Robert Wickens, who had raced the past four iRacing rounds, and defending NASCAR Cup champion Kyle Busch, who finished 13th in his IndyCar iRacing debut.
Also absent from the field were fan favorite James Hinchcliffe as well as Kyle Kaiser, Felipe Nasr and Spencer Pigot, who had all participated in previous IndyCar iRacing events.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Dream Team' by the numbers: 8 absurd stats that defined USA's 1992 Olympic basketball team</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The ESPN documentary "The Last Dance" will bring back the "Dream Team" in his week's episode.
The 1992 United States men's basketball team —which featured Bulls stars Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen —is the greatest basketball team of all time when you consider the accomplishments.
The memories are still real from the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, but it's the numbers that do this team even more justice.
Here is a by-the-numbers-look at the "Dream Team":
INSIDE THE 'DREAM TEAM'Everything to know about the 1992 U.S. men's Olympic basketball team
8: Eightof the top 50 NBA scorers of all time played on the Dream Team. That list includes Karl Malone (36,928), Jordan (32,292), Patrick Ewing (24,815), Charles Barkley (23,757), Clyde Drexler (22,195), Larry Bird (21,791), David Robinson (20,790)and John Stockton (19,711).
10: When the NBA at 50 released its top 50 players of all time in 2017, a total of 10 members of the Dream Team made that list. The only players that were not on the top 50 were Chris Mullin and Christian Laettner.
15: The Dream Team roster combined for 15 NBA MVP awards. Jordan leads the way with six, but Magic Johnson and Bird were three-time MVPs. Karl Malone won the award twice, and Robinson and Barkley also won NBA MVP honors in the 1990s.
23: The members of the Dream Team combined for 23 NBA championship rings. Jordan and Pippen have six each, followed by Johnson with five and Bird with three. Robinson won two championships with the Spurs, and Clyde Drexler won a championship with the Rockets.
MORE: Did Michael Jordan really block Isiah Thomas from making 'Dream Team' roster?
43.8: The Dream Team won eight games at the 1992 Summer Olympics by an average of 43.8 points per game. Team USA beat Croatia 117-85 in the gold medal game – their smallest margin of victory in the Olympics.
51.5: Team USA won six games at the Tournament of Americas by an average of 51.5 points per game leading up to the Olympics. That included a 136-57 blowout against Cuba in the qualifying opener on June 28, 1992.
117: The 12 players on the Dream Team combined for 117 NBA All-Star Game appearances. Jordan and Malone led the way with 14 appearances each over their entire careers.
118.9: In 14 international games, the Dream Team averaged 118.9 points per game and never scored less than 100 points in a single game.
Here is the complete roster of USA's 1992 Olympic men's basketball team:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Veteran forward Kelly Babstock signs with NWHL’s Toronto expansion team</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kelly Babstock is ready to have her name written in hockey’s history books.
Babstock, from Mississauga, Ont., signed with the new Toronto franchise of the National Women’s Hockey League on Saturday. Toronto’s new team was announced on April 22, and is the first Canadian city to have a club in the American NWHL.
“It’s a super exciting situation to be in, being a part of the inaugural Toronto NWHL team,” said Babstock. “It’s making history, and there’s nothing better than being a part of the history books, being a part of something bigger than yourself.”
The 27-year-old Babstock played in the first four seasons of the NWHL, the first three as a member of the Connecticut Whale and the 2018-19 season with the Buffalo Beauts.
She has 27 goals and 33 assists in 65 games, appearing in NWHL all-star game in 2017 and 2018.
Five other players were named to Toronto’s roster when the as-yet unnamed franchise was unveiled April 22, including forwards Shiann Darkangelo and Taylor Woods, defenders Emma Greco and Kristen Barbara, and goaltender Elaine Chuli.
Babstock says she’s happy to once again play with Darkangelo and Greco, who were her teammates on the Whale.
“It’s going to be super exciting to reunite with those girls again, and I’m excited to see what the future roster holds,” said Babstock.
Babstock, Chuli, Greco, Darkangelo and Woods were all members of the Professional Women’s Hockey Players Association.
The PWHPA had balked at competing for either the NWHL or Canadian Women’s Hockey League last season, instead pushing for the establishment of a single league capable of paying players a fair wage and with a financially stable long-term economic model.
The CWHL folded at the end of last season, but members of the PWHPA continue to hold out, staging their own exhibition series until it was put on hold by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Our mission as the PWHPA has not changed and we are still moving forward with next season — in full force,” said the PWHPA in a statement when the Toronto expansion was announced. “Simply put, the opportunities that the NWHL will provide may be good for some players, but it’s not the opportunities that we want for our players or for future generations of young girls who will play the game at the highest level.”
For her part, Babstock hopes the labour impasse comes to an end and she’s looking forward to getting back on the ice.
“The PWHPA and the NWHL are unfortunately divided,” said Babstock. “I don’t know why that is. I’m still wondering about that.”
The NWHL was founded in 2015, becoming North America’s first pro women’s hockey league to pay its players a salary. It currently has teams in Boston, Monmouth Junction, N.J., Danbury, Conn., Buffalo, N.Y., and Saint Paul, Minn.
Babstock lives and works in Connecticut as a hockey coach and will fly to and from Toronto for games and practices. When the Toronto team visits Boston, Monmouth Junction, or Danbury she’ll just drive from home to those games.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Countdown to UFC 249 full video for ‘Ferguson vs Gaethje’ in Florida</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is on track to return at UFC 249 on May 9, 2020, and a little pandemic isn’t stopping it from providing some behind-the-scenes looks at some of the many headliners appearing at the event. “Countdown” to UFC 249 focuses on the pair of title fights featured at the top of the card: an interim Lightweight title fight between Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje, and a Bantamweight title showdown between Henry Cejudo and Dominick Cruz.
Of course, it’d be impossible to tell Ferguson’s story without including details from the fallout of that other UFC 249 card (details) — the one that was supposed to go down on April 18, 2020, that was shut down at the eleventh-hour after the governor of California called the CEO of Disney, parent company to ESPN. No such craziness is expected this time. Florida leadership has welcomed UFC into their state with open arms, and UFC has been working on enhanced safety procedures to minimize the risk in these troubled times.
But enough about that bummer stuff. Take a look at the current lineup for the fight card:
155 lbs.: Tony Ferguson vs. Justin Gaethje (not Khabib Nurmagomedov) for interim UFC Lightweight championship
135 lbs.: Bantamweight champion Henry Cejudo vs. Dominick Cruz
265 lbs.: Francis Ngannou vs. Jairzinho Rozenstruik145 lbs.: Jeremy Stephens vs. Calvin Kattar265 lbs.: Greg Hardy vs. Yorgan de Castro
155 lbs.: Donald Cerrone vs. Anthony Pettis265 lbs.: Fabricio Werdum vs. Aleksei Oleinik115 lbs.: Carla Esparza vs. Michelle Waterson185 lbs.: Uriah Hall vs. Jacare Souza
170 lbs.: Vicente Luque vs. Niko Price145 lbs: Bryce Mitchell vs. Charles Rosa185 lbs.: Sam Alvey vs. Ryan Spann
***Fight card, bout order and the amount of matches subject to drastic change because of the various global quarantine restrictions.***

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there will be no fans in attendance in the arena and the UFC assures that appropriate safety measures will be taken for the athletes.
Khabib Nurmagomedov still can’t leave Russia, so the main event will be for an interim UFC lightweight title between Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje. The co-main will be contested for the bantamweight title, with champ Henry Cejudo taking on former champ Dominick Cruz.
Here’s a look at the full card, which will air on ESPN networks and ESPN+ PPV.
Main Card (10pm ET, ESPN+ PPV)
Tony Ferguson vs. Justin Gaethje
Henry Cejudo vs. Dominick Cruz
Francis Ngannou vs. Jairzinho Rozenstruik
Jeremy Stephens vs. Calvin Kattar
Greg Hardy vs. Yorgan De Castro
Preliminary Card (6:30pm ET, ESPN)
Donald Cerrone vs. Anthony Pettis
Aleksei Oleinik vs. Fabricio Werdum
Jacare Souza vs. Uriah Hall
Carla Esparza vs. Michelle Waterson
Early Prelims (5pm ET, ESPN+)
Vicente Luque vs. Niko Price

    <h5 class="mb-1">UFC announces official fight cards for events on 13th and 16th May</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the upcoming blockbuster UFC 249 almost upon us, the UFC has now announced the official fight cards for its upcoming shows in Florida on May 13 and May 16, which will follow the May 9 magnum opus featuring Tony Ferguson vs. Justin Gaethje in the main event. All three shows will be held inside the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, Florida.
The May 13 card is a revamped card for UFC Fight Night Lincoln, which had to be cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The card is headlined by a five-round light heavyweight contest between Anthony 'Lionheart' Smith and Glover Teixeira, originally booked to go down in UFC Lincoln.
Three days later, on May 16, the UFC will hold their third event in a week which features a heavyweight showdown of epic proportions between Alistair Overeem and Walt Harris as the main event. Overeem and Harris were originally scheduled to fight in April at UFC Portland but even that show was later called off due to the ongoing pandemic.
The co-main event of the night will see former strawweight title contender Claudia Gadelha squaring off against the in form Angela Hill who is heading into the fight with three consecutive wins under her belt; and what's even more astonishing is the fact that two out of the three wins came this year and it's only May.
Given below are the full cards for May 13 and May 16, including the main card and prelims:
MAIN CARD
MAIN EVENT: Anthony Smith vs. Glover Teixeira
Ben Rothwell vs. Ovince Saint Preux
Alexander Hernandez vs. Drew Dober
Ray Borg vs. Ricky Simon

    <h5 class="mb-1">Biden backs women's soccer team after lawsuit setback</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Saturday voiced his support for the U.S. women’s soccer team, a day after it suffered a setback in its gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation.
The team’s claims for equal pay were dismissed by a court on Friday, handing a victory to U.S. Soccer.
“Don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet,” Biden wrote in a tweet to the team.
“Equal pay, now. Or else when I’m president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding,” Biden added to the federation.
The former vice president is looking to unseat incumbent Republican Donald Trump in November’s U.S. presidential election.
The World Cup-winning team’s long-running feud with U.S. Soccer has been a very public and bitter battle and the players had been seeking $66 million in damages under the Equal Pay Act.
On Friday, Judge R. Gary Klausner of the United States District Court for the Central District of California threw out the players’ claims that they were under paid in comparison with the men’s national team.
The court allowed complaints of unfair medical, travel and training to proceed to trial, which is scheduled to begin June 16.
“The WNT (Women’s National Team) has been paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the MNT (Men’s National Team) over the class period,” the court said in its summary judgment.
U.S. Soccer on Friday said it wanted to work with the team to “chart a positive path forward to grow the game both here at home and around the world.”
The players have said they plan to appeal the court’s decision.
Billie Jean King, who famously battled for equal pay in tennis, also offered words of encouragement to the team on Saturday.
“This is a setback, but it is not the end of the fight,” she wrote on Twitter.
“The pursuit of equality is a marathon not a sprint, and this lawsuit has generated a meaningful conversation about the treatment of women in sports,” she said.
“One ruling does not diminish its impact.”
Last month U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro resigned over language used in a court filing suggesting women possess less ability than men when it comes to soccer.
The language prompted an on-field protest by players, who wore their warmup jerseys inside out to obscure the U.S. Soccer logo prior to a game, and a critical response from several of the team’s commercial sponsors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Motor racing: Vettel makes his esports debut in Legends Trophy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON (Reuters) - Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel made his esports debut on Saturday in Legends Trophy races that also featured retired Formula One world champions Emerson Fittipaldi and Jenson Button.
The German has some time on his hands with Formula One’s season stalled by the COVID-19 pandemic and organisers hoping to get going in Austria at the start of July.
The four times champion finished 15th and 12th respectively after being caught up in incidents on the virtual version of the Sepang circuit that hosted the Malaysian Grand Prix between 1999 and 2017.
While Vettel, 32, and Button, 40, are both actual Malaysian Grand Prix winners, 73-year-old Fittipaldi’s time was in the 1970s when the real Brabham BT44s, simulated in the virtual race, were around.
The first race was won by Colombian former McLaren and Williams F1 driver Juan Pablo Montoya, a double Indianapolis 500 winner, while the second went to Mexican Adrian Fernandez.
Vettel’s team mate Charles Leclerc has been active on various platforms from his Monaco apartment, even taking part in virtual lawn mower and truck races.
The 22-year-old Monegasque has also won two Formula One virtual races and will take part in another on Sunday, which would have been the day of the postponed Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort.
Vettel acquired a simulator only recently from the Allinsports company owned by Torque Esports, organisers of the Legends Trophy, and said he would try it out for fun at his Swiss home.
“I’m aware that some people take it very seriously and spend a lot of time there but I also enjoy doing other things,” the German, a father of three, told reporters this month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel makes esports debut in Legends Trophy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">London – Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel made his esports debut on Saturday in Legends Trophy races that also featured retired Formula One world champions Emerson Fittipaldi and Jenson Button.
The German has some time on his hands with Formula One's season stalled by the COVID-19 pandemic and organizers hoping to get going in Austria at the start of July.
The four-time champion finished 15th and 12th respectively after being caught up in incidents on the virtual version of the Sepang circuit that hosted the Malaysian Grand Prix between 1999-2017.
While Vettel, 32, and Button, 40, are both actual Malaysian Grand Prix winners, 73-year-old Fittipaldi's time was in the 1970s when the real Brabham BT44s, simulated in the virtual race, were around.
The first race was won by former McLaren and Williams F1 driver Juan Pablo Montoya, a double Indianapolis 500 winner, while the second went to Adrian Fernandez.
Vettel's team mate Charles Leclerc has been active on various platforms from his Monaco apartment, even taking part in virtual lawn mower and truck races. The 22-year-old has also won two Formula One virtual races and will take part in another on Sunday, which would have been the day of the postponed Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort.
Vettel acquired a simulator only recently from the Allinsports-owned by Torque Esports, organizers of the Legends Trophy, and said he would try it out for fun at his Swiss home.
"I’m aware that some people take it very seriously and spend a lot of time there but I also enjoy doing other things," the German, a father of three, told reporters this month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vettel is convinced and makes his simrace debut</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Many Formula 1 drivers have ventured into sim racing during quarantine, but Sebastian Vettel has not followed his colleagues. This will change on Saturday night as the four-time world champion makes his sim racing debut.
Last week Vettel revealed that he had bought a simulator. However, it was not certain whether the German would participate in the various sim races with other Formula 1 drivers, such as Max Verstappen and Lando Norris. According to Sebastian Vettel the purchase is more for his pleasure.
Nevertheless, the Ferrari driver decided to make his sim racing debut. Vettel can be seen Saturday night in the Legends Trophy of The Race, in the first race of the new season.
In addition to Vettel, more former and current Formula 1 drivers will be seen in the race. Among others Jenson Button, Juan Pablo Montoya and Jan Magnussen will also show their faces. The race can be followed via the YouTube channel of The Race.

    <h5 class="mb-1">F1 News: Sim racing becoming 'more and more scientific' for Norris</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lando Norris has started working with his 2019 McLaren Formula 1 engineer for his sim racing events as the discipline becomes "more and more scientific".
McLaren driver Norris has been prolific in sim racing while real-world motorsport remains on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic, taking part in events across F1, IndyCar and V8 Supercars.
Norris made his debut in IndyCar's official iRacing series last weekend in an event at the Circuit of The Americas, where he took victory from pole position against a field of IndyCar regulars.
In preparation for the event, Norris linked up with his former McLaren F1 engineer, Andrew Jarvis, who is now part of McLaren's IndyCar programme in the United States.
The 2020 F1 sophomore explained the greater level of detail in sim racing made it important to function as a proper race team with its preparations for the IndyCar event.
"I think the IndyCar race that we just competed in was probably the most involved I've been in terms of working on my driving," Norris said in an interview on Sky Sports.
"I guess bringing Jarv into it, and a few of the McLaren guys - I've been working with the McLaren Arrow SP team, working with Pato [O'Ward], with Ollie [Askew], with Robbie [Wickens].
"Being able to look at the data in-depth and actually having my F1 engineer from last year going through things, understanding how to really work on different areas [helped].
"A lot of the things I was doing and my characteristics on the actual race track, I was actually replicating on the simulator, some are good, some are bad, but it's very good in terms of being able to work on those things."
Norris said the advances in sim racing meant it was possible to make proper improvements by analysing data just as he would on the real-world circuit.
"It's getting more and more scientific, getting more data involved, and the programmes are getting better and better," Norris said.
"It's not there and it's not real, for sure, and it's still a simulation at the end of the day.
"But you're still able to look at things in a lot of depth, look at a lot of traces on the data, build set-up and improve driving from everything.
"So it's still very interactive to work with."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Italy gives Serie A clubs hope with training ruling</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Italy offered Serie A clubs a glimmer of hope on Sunday after it said footballers could take part in individual training sessions as the strictest coronavirus lockdown measures begin to ease.
The interior ministry's go-ahead for players to attend their club's training facilities offered fans in the football mad country the first sign that the 2019-20 season might yet be saved.
Matches were abandoned on March 9 in the face of a health crisis that has now officially claimed nearly 29,000 lives in Italy and 245,000 worldwide.
Some of the bigger clubs with title aspirations from the less affected regions have been talking about going back to training for weeks.
But Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte only allowed teams to resume organised activities on May 18 -- a date that might push back this season's completion into the start of the next.
Several regions that have avoided the worst of the pandemic have taken matters into their own hands and allowed clubs to open their facilities for players to train on their own.
Teams such as Napoli and Parma have followed the lead of Lazio -- trailing leaders Juventus by just a point -- and gave the nod for players to return.
They insisted that they were not breaking the rules because Conte has allowed all Italians to start exercising in open public places starting Monday.
The interior ministry bowed to the seemingly inevitable on Sunday and agreed that teams can open their facilities to players for training.
"Athletes, professional or otherwise, of non-individual sports are allowed -- just as every citizen -- to exercise in public or private areas," the interior ministry said.
But players must "respect social distancing rules of at least two metres and the ban on public gatherings."
Italian media read the statement as an encouraging sign for football.
"Serie A clubs (and not only) can return to training," the La Repubblica daily wrote.
Yet Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora has noted that the path for football to return was getting "increasingly narrow".
And league president Paolo Dal Pino said Serie A "will comply" should Conte decide that it was simply too dangerous to complete the campaign.
The teams themselves seem hopelessly divided about what they should do.
Those that play in northern regions that were hardest hit by the virus have voiced the gravest concern.
Brescia president Massimo Cellino -- whose team is based at the very heart of the outbreak -- said in March that he would rather forfeit games than play in a "plague".
The 63-year-old revealed that he had tested positive for the virus a few weeks later.
"It would be unfortunate if some teams can start again and others cannot," Fiorentina coach Beppe Iachini said on Saturday.
"I think teams like Atalanta, Milan, Inter, Juve and Turino have had more problems than the others," he said of the main northern clubs.
"If we do start, we have to do it all together."

But players must “respect social distancing rules of at least two metres and the ban on public gatherings.”
Italian media read the statement as an encouraging sign for football.
“Serie A clubs (and not only) can return to training,” the La Repubblica daily wrote.
Yet Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora has noted that the path for football to return was getting “increasingly narrow”.
And league president Paolo Dal Pino said Serie A “will comply” should Conte decide that it was simply too dangerous to complete the campaign.
The teams themselves seem hopelessly divided about what they should do. Those that play in northern regions that were hardest hit by the virus have voiced the gravest concern.
Brescia president Massimo Cellino – whose team is based at the very heart of the outbreak – said in March that he would rather forfeit games than play in a “plague”.
The 63-year-old revealed that he had tested positive for the virus a few weeks later.
“It would be unfortunate if some teams can start again and others cannot,” Fiorentina coach Beppe Iachini said on Saturday.
“I think teams like Atalanta, Milan, Inter, Juve and Turino have had more problems than the others,” he said of the main northern clubs.
“If we do start, we have to do it all together.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Italy gives Serie A clubs hope with training ruling</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Italy offered Serie A clubs a glimmer of hope on Sunday after it said footballers could take part in individual training sessions as the strictest coronavirus lockdown measures begin to ease.
The interior ministry's go-ahead for players to attend their club's training facilities offered fans in the football mad country the first sign that the 2019-20 season might yet be saved.
Matches were abandoned on March 9 in the face of a health crisis that has now officially claimed nearly 29,000 lives in Italy and 245,000 worldwide.
Some of the bigger clubs with title aspirations from the less affected regions have been talking about going back to training for weeks.
But Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte only allowed teams to resume organised activities on May 18 -- a date that might push back this season's completion into the start of the next.
Several regions that have avoided the worst of the pandemic have taken matters into their own hands and allowed clubs to open their facilities for players to train on their own.
Teams such as Napoli and Parma have followed the lead of Lazio -- trailing leaders Juventus by just a point -- and gave the nod for players to return.
They insisted that they were not breaking the rules because Conte has allowed all Italians to start exercising in open public places starting Monday.
The interior ministry bowed to the seemingly inevitable on Sunday and agreed that teams can open their facilities to players for training.
"Athletes, professional or otherwise, of non-individual sports are allowed -- just as every citizen -- to exercise in public or private areas," the interior ministry said.
But players must "respect social distancing rules of at least two metres and the ban on public gatherings."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bears decline fifth-year option on Mitchell Trubisky, says report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Chicago Bears have declined the fifth-year option on the rookie contract of quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported on Saturday.
Trubisky’s deal is set to expire at the end of the 2020 season, and in that campaign he will have to compete with Nick Foles – acquired from the Jacksonville Jaguars in March – for practice repetitions and the starting job.
Trubisky will be playing for his next contract – whether it is in Chicago or elsewhere.
The Bears traded up from the third pick to number two overall in the 2017 draft to select Trubisky out of North Carolina, but he has failed to live up to his draft status.
The success of Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson, who were drafted later in the first round, has added to the pain felt by Chicago supporters.
Trubisky started 14 games in 2018 with a 95.4 passer rating, helped lead the Bears to a playoff berth and was selected to the Pro Bowl.
He regressed last year, posting an 83.0 passer rating and seeing a drop-off in his completion percentage, yards and touchdowns, prompting Chicago to trade a fourth-round draft pick for Foles.
Trubisky was the first draft pick made by general manager Ryan Pace and was hailed as the foundation of a rebuild in the mould of the New Orleans Saints, for whom Pace had worked previously.
With the deadline to decide on fifth-year options for the 2017 draft class coming on Monday, that crop of players has come under the microscope in recent days.
While Mahomes, drafted number 12 overall, has been the crown jewel of the class, Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett is the only top-five pick to have his fifth-year option picked up.
Earlier this week, the San Francisco 49ers declined their option on defensive lineman Solomon Thomas, as did the Jaguars with running back Leonard Fournette and the Tennessee Titans with wide receiver Corey Davis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Source: Bengals not picking up fifth-year option on WR John Ross</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CINCINNATI -- The Bengals have informed wide receiver John Ross that they will not be picking up the fifth year of his rookie contract, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Saturday.
Ross, who was selected ninth overall in the 2017 draft, has struggled to stay on the field during his first three NFL seasons. The former Washington product has played a total of 24 games.
The 24-year-old Ross is set to earn $2.8 million in base salary in 2020.
Under the rules of the current collective bargaining agreement, the value of Ross' fifth-year option would be equivalent to the transition tag for a wide receiver since he was a top-10 pick. In 2020, the transition tag for a receiver was worth $15.7 million.
In 2019, Ross was on the verge of a promising season. He opened the year with a career-high 158 receiving yards and two touchdowns in a loss at Seattle. A week later, he had four catches for 112 yards and a score in a blowout loss to San Francisco.
He injured his sternoclavicular joint in a Week 4 loss to Pittsburgh, however, and was placed on injured reserve. He finished last season as a reserve, catching 28 passes for 506 yards and three touchdowns.
Ross has 49 career catches for 716 yards and 10 touchdowns.
Ross joins A.J. Green as Bengals receivers who are not under contract beyond the 2020 season. Green was given a one-year franchise tag after his previous contract lapsed following the 2019 season.
Cincinnati drafted former Clemson wideout Tee Higgins in the second round of this year's draft.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Undrafted OU, OSU standouts have made their mark in the NFL</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NFL Draft ended last Saturday with 255 players selected, counting compensatory picks at the end of the last four rounds.
Many players were disappointed that their name was not called — starting with cornerbacks A.J. Green of OSU and Parnell Motley of OU. But their phone still rang, with franchises rushing to sign undrafted free agents.
Green signed with the Browns, and Motley signed with Buccaneers, and those players have a fighting chance to make a roster.
In fact, many Bedlam veterans have had good NFL careers even though they were bypassed in the draft. I found 16 former Sooners or former Cowboys who went undrafted, then had an NFL career that registered at least double digits in profootball-reference.com’s approximate value. Pro football reference attempts to give each player a rating, based on their accomplishments. It’s not an exact science, and it’s not meant to go over the cliff, arguing that someone with a 46 is automatically better than someone with a 44. But it’s an invaluable tool to gauge the general value of a career.
So here are the NFL’s top 16 players from either OU or OSU, who went undrafted:
1. Tony Banfield, OSU: The defensive back from the 1950s went undrafted in 1960 but caught on with the Houston Oilers of the fledgling American Football League. Banfield became an AFL mainstay, playing five years as a cornerback and making 27 interceptions. He three times was first-team all-AFL.
2. Wahoo McDaniel, OU: Played in the NFL (or AFL) from 1960-68 and did more in the pros than he did at OU. The linebacker played 150 games, with 13 career interceptions. He also punted for the ’66 Dolphins.
3. Juqua Parker, OSU: The Bob Simmons-era defensive end signed with the 2001 Tennessee Titans and began a 12-year career, mostly as a pass-rush specialist. Parker made 46 starts but played in 162 games and had 42.5 sacks and 266 tackles total.
4. Duane Wood, OSU: The Banfield story — another Cowboy defensive back who caught on with the AFL in 1960. Wood played five years for the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs and had 20 career interceptions.
5. Dan Bailey, OSU: You know him well, as one of the most accurate kickers in NFL history. In nine seasons with the Cowboys and Vikings, Bailey has made 234 of 268 attempts, a percentage of .873 that ranks sixth-best in NFL history.
6. Lane Taylor, OSU: A guard on the Cowboys’ great 2010 and 2011 teams, Taylor went undrafted in 2013 but signed with Green Bay and has become one of the Aaron Rodgers’ prime protectors. Taylor has played 78 career games and made 49 starts.
7. Tony Jefferson, OU: Hard-hitting safety has played the last seven years, with the Cardinals and Ravens. He’s made 66 starts and has 451 career tackles.
8. Cary Blanchard, OSU: Before Bailey, there was Blanchard. A nine-year kicker, 1992-2000, Blanchard made 165 career field goals and scored 683 NFL points.
9. James Allen, OU: How did Allen go undrafted? A blue-chip tailback at Wynnewood High School, Allen didn’t have a great Sooner career, but he had a good career. A solid runner and solid citizen. Allen rushed for 1,120 yards for the 2000 Bears and in a five-year career (1998-2002) he had 2,497 rushing yards, 964 receiving yards and seven total touchdowns.
10. Remi Ayodele, OU: A mostly-forgotten defensive lineman as a Sooner, Ayodele went undrafted in 2007 but hooked on with the Dallas Cowboys and played five years in the league as a nose guard, making 42 starts over his final three seasons. He had 90 career tackles at a position mostly designed to take up space.
11. Damien Williams, OU: Sooner career ended with a suspension in 2013, but Williams has forged a good NFL career, including Super Bowl heroics this February (two touchdowns). In six NFL seasons, Williams has rushed for 1,231 yards and 12 TDs, including a 91-yard run in 2019 for Kansas City. Williams also has 138 catches for 1,196 yards.
12. Brandon Moore, OU: Linebacker from the early Bob Stoops years played seven NFL seasons, mostly with the 49ers. He made 26 starts and 249 career tackles.
13. Jacob Lacey, OSU: Cornerback hooked on with the 2009 Colts and played four NFL seasons, making 36 starts and six interceptions.
14. Corey Ivy, OU: The defensive back from Moore High School signed with the 2001 Buccaneers and last nine years in the NFL, making 21 starts. He had three interceptions and 280 tackles.
15. Tress Way, OU: The Redskins’ punter for six straight seasons has averaged 46.6 yards for his career, sixth-best in NFL history. He twice has led the league.
16. Charlie Durkee, OSU: This is becoming a trend. Another Cowboy kicker. Durkee signed with the 1967 Saints and kicked four years, making 52 field goals.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tennessee Titans sign safety Ibraheim Campbell from the Packers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Tennessee Titans have signed safety Ibraheim Campbell of Philadelphia, PA to a one year contract according to Spotrac on Friday. Financial terms were not disclosed.
To say that Campbell has bounced around in the National Football League is an understatement. He has already played for five NFL teams in a span of five seasons. They are the Cleveland Browns, Houston Texans, Green Bay Packers, Dallas Cowboys, and New York Jets.
Last season with the Packers, Campbell played in seven games and started in three contests with Green Bay. He had one forced fumble, 14 combined tackles (eight solo tackles and six assisted tackles).
Campbell’s forced fumble in 2019 was the second fumble of his NFL career. It came in a 24-16 Packers win over the Carolina Panthers on November 10, 2019.
Campbell has also had the opportunity of playing in two postseason games. Both of those came in the 2020 National Football League playoffs with the Green Bay Packers, who reached the NFC Championship this past season. Campbell had one tackle in the Packers’ 28-23 win over the Seattle Seahawks in the National Football Conference Divisional Playoff on January 12 and then two tackles in the Packers’ 37-20 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship on January 19.
Over the last five seasons, Campbell has played in 53 games and started in 15 games. He has one pass deflection, two forced fumbles, one fumble recovery, 115 combined tackles (80 solo tackles and 35 combined tackles), two tackles for a loss and one quarterback hit. Campbell’s lone career fumble recovery came in a 12-9 Browns loss, ironically to Campbell’s current team, the Titans, on October 22, 2017.
Initially drafted by the Browns in the 2015 NFL Draft (fourth round, 115th overall), Campbell played 37 games with Cleveland and started 11 of them from 2015 to 2017. He then suffered a hamstring injury in 2017 and was subsequently put on waivers and picked up by the Texans. Campbell only played one game for Houston in 2017, before playing for the Packers, Cowboys, and Jets in 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Packers sign defensive tackle Treyvon Hester from the Redskins</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to the Associated Press on Friday, the Green Bay Packers signed defensive tackle Treyvon Hester of Pittsburgh, PA from the Washington Redskins to a contract. The length of the contract and the financial terms have not yet been disclosed, but the signing was confirmed on the Green Bay Packers Twitter account. 
Hester will be joining his fourth National Football League franchise. Remarkably, he has played for a different NFL team in each of the last three seasons. He was with the Oakland Raiders in 2017, the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018, and the Redskins in 2019.
Last season in Washington, Hester played 15 games, had one fumble recovery, one sack, eight combined tackles (two solo tackles and six assisted tackles), one tackle for a loss and one quarterback hit. Hester registered his lone sack, tackle for a loss and quarterback hit in 2019 in a 17-16 Redskins win over the Miami Dolphins on October 13.
Hester’s fumble recovery in 2019 was the first of his NFL career. It came in a 24-3 Redskins loss to the New York Giants on September 29.
In 41 NFL career regular season games, Hester started two games, and had one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, two sacks, 40 combined tackles (19 solo tackles and 21 assisted tackles), four tackles for a loss and eight quarterback hits. Hester’s lone forced fumble came in his rookie season during a 33-8 Raiders loss to the New England Patriots on November 19, 2017.
However, it is in the postseason where Hester has generated his greatest fame. In the NFC Wildcard Game on January 6, 2019, Hester tipped a 43 yard-field goal attempt by Bears kicker Cody Parkey during the game’s final play. As a result, the football hit one upright and then the crossbar before falling to the ground. The game is known as the Double Doink game and was won by the Eagles 16-15. The fact that Hester was responsible for eliminating the Packers’ top rival, the Chicago Bears, from the 2019 NFL Playoffs, has already made him “a legend” in the eyes of the Packers faithful.

Ross has 49 career catches for 716 yards and 10 touchdowns.
Ross joins A.J. Green as Bengals receivers who are not under contract beyond the 2020 season. Green was given a one-year franchise tag after his previous contract lapsed following the 2019 season.
Cincinnati drafted former Clemson wideout Tee Higgins in the second round of this year's draft.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The San Francisco 49ers came away with what many consider one of the best draft classes in the NFL last week. San Francisco also scored some of the top undrafted free agents – one of them being Division III QB Broc Rutter.
The former North Central College QB was a star at the Division III level, throwing for over 8,000 yards and 86 touchdowns over the last two seasons. The 49ers believe they may have found a diamond in the rough here. Rutter will likely serve as the No. 3 QB to start his NFL career.
Upon signing his undrafted free-agent contract, the former North Central College QB wasn’t supposed to receive a bonus. But after the 49ers finished the rest of their undrafted rookie bonus deals, just $279 was left over in the bonus pool.
To welcome him to the NFL, San Francisco decided to give the remaining $279 to Rutter as a bonus. The bonus total may be one of the smallest bonuses ever given in the NFL. NFL insider Tom Pelissero has the latest:
At least the 49ers didn’t let the leftover bonus money go to waste.
The former Division III QB is certainly getting his NFL career started in a unique way.
Rutter will remember this experience for the rest of his life.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Teams around the NFL only have a few days left to make major decisions on players from the 2017 NFL draft.
Each and every team with a first-round pick must decide whether or not they want to pick up the fifth-year option on those players. May 4 looms large as the final day for teams to make these decisions.
Well, most of the teams in the league have already made their respective decisions. The Cincinnati Bengals joined that list this afternoon with a decision on wide receiver John Ross.
According to a report from ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter, the Bengals declined the fifth-year option for Ross. The former No. 9 overall pick is now tied to the team only through the 2020 season.
Ross was in the midst of his best season during the start of the 2019 campaign.
Through four games, the former first-round pick racked up 16 receptions for 328 yards and three touchdowns. Unfortunately, he suffered a sternoclavicular and missed eight games during the regular season.
He’ll return to the starting lineup alongside star wide receiver A.J. Green, who missed the entire 2019 campaign. Both should provide rookie quarterback Joe Burrow with a full complement of weapons in 2020.
The Bengals offense could surprise opposing defenses this season.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Tampa Bay Buccaneers claimed kicker Elliott Fry off waivers from the Carolina Panthers.
Fry, 25, was with the Chicago Bears and Baltimore Ravens in the 2019 preseason but was cut by both teams. He signed a futures contract with the Panthers in December.
An undrafted free agent from South Carolina, Fry took part in the rookie minicamp with the Buccaneers in 2017.
His professional regular-season experience came in 2019 with the Orlando Apollos of the Alliance of American Football, and he was 14-of-14 on field goal attempts, including a long of 47 yards.
Fry is the Gamecocks’ all-time leading scorer, tallying 359 points over four seasons.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Report: Bears declining Mitchell Trubisky’s fifth-year option</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Chicago Bears will not pick up the fifth-year option on quarterback Mitchell Trubisky’s rookie contract, according to NFL Network‘s Tom Pelissero.
The decision means Trubisky is currently slated to become an unrestricted free agent after the 2020 season.
Trubisky is the just the latest top-five pick from the 2017 draft to have their option declined, as only Myles Garrett has had his picked up by the Cleveland Browns.
The 25-year-old Trubisky was the first quarterback selected in the 2017 draft as the Bears traded up one spot to select the North Carolina pivot second overall. The selection of Trubisky, however, has garnered plenty of criticism in the years since as both Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson were picked afterwards, 10th and 12th, respectively.
General manager Ryan Pace largely staked his reputation to Trubisky when he traded up a spot with San Francisco to draft him ahead of Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes and Houston’s Deshaun Watson. While Mahomes and Watson have emerged as two of the NFL’s best quarterbacks, Trubisky has mixed promising flashes with too many poor decisions and throws. And he is facing a murky future in Chicago.
Chicago lacked playmakers to complement receiver Allen Robinson and got little production from its tight ends. It addressed that issue by signing five-time Pro Bowl tight end Jimmy Graham in March and drafting Notre Dame’s Cole Kmet in the second round last month.
Trubisky had a typically tough rookie campaign in 2017, but played better in 2018 under new head coach Matt Nagy as the Bears went 12-4 (11-3 with Trubisky under centre) and Chicago made the post-season for the first time since 2010. However, Trubisky and the Bears regressed in 2019, finishing outside of the playoffs with an 8-8 record and an offence that ranked 25th out of 32.
In response, the Bears acquired Super Bowl LII MVP Nick Foles in a trade with the Jacksonville Jaguars this off-season and declared the two quarterbacks would battle it out for next season’s starting spot.
As mentioned above, Pelissero reports the Bears have been impressed with Trubisky’s response to the Foles acquisition.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AP source: Bears decline Trubisky's 5th-year option for 2021</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Chicago Bears have declined their fifth-year option for quarterback Mitchell Trubisky for the 2021 season, a person familiar with the situation said Saturday.
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the move has not been announced. The NFL Network first reported the decision.
The move is hardly a surprise considering the way Trubisky struggled in his third season since the Bears drafted him with the No. 2 overall pick. His yards (3,138), completion rate (63.2%), touchdowns (17) and rating (83) all dropped from the previous year.
The Bears acquired 2018 Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles from Jacksonville in March and plan to hold an open competition for the starting job.
General manager Ryan Pace largely staked his reputation to Trubisky when he traded up a spot with San Francisco to draft him ahead of Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes and Houston’s Deshaun Watson. While Mahomes and Watson have emerged as two of the NFL’s best quarterbacks, Trubisky has mixed promising flashes with too many poor decisions and throws. And he is facing a murky future in Chicago.
The Bears went 8-8 and missed the playoffs for the eighth time in nine years last season after winning the NFC North at 12-4. Though their defense continued to excel, their offense ranked among the worst in the NFL.
Chicago lacked playmakers to complement receiver Allen Robinson and got little production from its tight ends. It addressed that issue by signing five-time Pro Bowl tight end Jimmy Graham in March and drafting Notre Dame’s Cole Kmet in the second round last month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Titans to decline fifth-year option on former No. 5 pick Corey Davis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1 (UPI) -- The Tennessee Titans are declining to pick up the fifth-year option on wide receiver Corey Davis.
ESPN and NFL Media confirmed the Titans' decision to not pick up the option Friday, meaning Davis will be in a contract year this season. According to ESPN, the fifth-year option would have carried a $15.68 million salary for Davis in the 2021 campaign.
Davis, the No. 5 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, has struggled with consistency in his first three seasons in Tennessee. Since entering the league, he has recorded 142 receptions for 1,867 yards and six touchdowns in 42 career games.
In 2019, Davis notched only two receiving scores during the regular season and another touchdown in the postseason against the Baltimore Ravens on a pass from star running back Derrick Henry. His best season came in 2018, when he set career highs in receptions (65), receiving yards (891) and touchdowns (four).
Meanwhile, the Titans are exercising the fifth-year option on cornerback Adoree' Jackson, according to ESPN and NFL Media. By picking up the option, the Titans guarantee Jackson's contract for injury only in 2021 and his salary will be about $10.24 million.
Jackson, the No. 18 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, has started 39 games over three NFL seasons. He has two interceptions and 33 passes defensed in his career.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Favourite Secretariat wins virtual Kentucky Derby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Secretariat won a virtual Kentucky Derby against 12 fellow Triple Crown winners, 47 years after the chestnut colt won the real race at Churchill Downs.
The 1 1/4-mile race featuring computer-generated imagery was held Saturday, the same day the 146th Derby had been scheduled until it was postponed by the coronavirus pandemic. The Derby has been reset for Sept. 5.
Secretariat was the 7-2 favourite, although there was no wagering. Instead, fans selecting the winning horse online were entered to win a VIP experience at the Derby this fall. Churchill Downs pledged to match US$1-million in fan donations to COVID-19 relief.
The virtual Derby was part of NBC’s three-hour telecast that reshowed portions of the 2015 coverage, in which American Pharoah won on his way to becoming racing’s first Triple Crown champion in 37 years.
The show opened with Churchill Downs bugler Steve Buttleman playing Call to the Post from the front steps of his Louisville home. It moved to the track, with shots of empty stands, betting windows and the jockeys’ room.
The track’s stable area is set to reopen May 11, with live racing expected to resume May 16.
“It’s weird not being there,” Bob Baffert, who trained American Pharoah, said in an interview from his California home.
Larry Collmus, who calls the Triple Crown races for NBC, provided a live call for the virtual Derby, seeing it unfold for the first time just as he would have been doing on the first Saturday in May.
“That was fun ‘calling’ Secretariat and the other Triple Crown winners,” he tweeted.
A virtual Seattle Slew, who won the 1977 Triple Crown, led much of the way until being overtaken in the stretch.
Secretariat surged to the lead in deep stretch in the middle of the track. No margins were provided.
The computer imagery failed to capture the dirt from the track that sticks to the horses running in the back, and there was no noise from the usual Derby day crowd of 150,000 or more. The race lacked the cavalry charge to the first turn that is typical of the usual 20-horse Derby field.
Secretariat was a two-time Horse of the Year, and swept the Derby, Preakness and Belmont, winning the last race by a record 31 lengths, in 1973.
Citation, the 1948 Triple Crown champion, finished second. Seattle Slew was third. Affirmed, the 1978 champion, was fourth, followed by American Pharoah.
NBC showed the real American Pharoah at Ashford Stud, where a flat-screen TV was set up in front of his stall to show the race. Now eight-years-old, he is a successful stallion with a stud fee of US$200,000.
Churchill Downs analyzed the historical past performance of each Triple Crown winner, and incorporated the opinions of horse-racing experts, who evaluated each contender’s achievements and put them into historical perspective.
That information, known as the fundamental probabilities, was fed into Inspire Entertainment’s computer models, which determined the final result by using those probabilities along with random number generation. The fundamental probabilities only determined the chances of each horse winning. Those with a higher probability value weren’t necessarily going to win; they just had a greater chance of doing so.
Also in the race were 1946 champion Assault, 1919 champion Sir Barton, 1930 champion Gallant Fox, 1937 champion War Admiral, 1941 champion Whirlaway, 1943 champion Count Fleet, 2018 champion Justify and 1935 champion Omaha.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Secretariat wins virtual Kentucky Derby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Secretariat won a virtual Kentucky Derby against 12 fellow Triple Crown winners, 47 years after the chestnut colt won the real race at Churchill Downs.
The 1 1/4-mile race featuring computer-generated imagery was held Saturday, the same day the 146th Derby had been scheduled until it was postponed by the coronavirus pandemic. The Derby has been re-set for Sept. 5.
Secretariat was the 7-2 favorite, although there was no wagering. Instead, fans selecting the winning horse online were entered to win a VIP experience at the Derby this fall. Churchill Downs pledged to match $1 million in fan donations to COVID-19 relief.
The virtual Derby was part of NBC’s three-hour telecast that re-showed portions of the 2015 coverage in which American Pharoah won on his way to becoming racing’s first Triple Crown champion in 37 years.
The show opened with Churchill Downs bugler Steve Buttleman playing “Call to the Post” from the front steps of his Louisville home. It moved to the track, with shots of empty stands, betting windows and the jockeys’ room.
The track’s stable area is set to re-open May 11, with live racing expected to resume May 16.

“It’s weird not being there,” Bob Baffert, who trained American Pharoah, said in an interview from his California home.
Larry Collmus, who calls the Triple Crown races for NBC, provided a live call for the virtual Derby, seeing it unfold for the first time just as he would have been doing on the first Saturday in May.
“That was fun ”calling” Secretariat and the other Triple Crown winners,” he tweeted.
A virtual Seattle Slew, who won the 1977 Triple Crown, led much of the way until being overtaken in the stretch.
Secretariat surged to the lead in deep stretch in the middle of the track. No margins were provided.
The computer imagery failed to capture the dirt from the track that sticks to the horses running in the back, and there was no noise from the usual Derby day crowd of 150,000 or more. The race lacked the cavalry charge to the first turn that is typical of the usual 20-horse Derby field.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MILAN
Players from several Italian football clubs were on course to resume individual training as the Mediterranean country prepared to gradually roll back its coronavirus lockdown.
The Italian government has been feuding for weeks with individual regions about which activities will be allowed when the nation begins to emerge from an economically crippling lockdown on Monday.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is lifting Italians' stay-at-home orders and permitting restaurants to resume takeout service next week.
But Conte has delayed announcing a restart to the Serie A season for fear of another spike in contagions for a disease that has officially killed 28,710 in Italy - second only to the United States.
Conte is only allowing clubs to resume team training on May 18.
Several regions that have avoided the worst of the outbreak say they will use a loophole to individual players to start training on Monday.
The voluntary sessions will affect teams such as Napoli in the south and the central Emilia-Romagna region's Bologna.
Parma announced they will open their facilities next week for use by their squad members
Rome's Lazio have also voiced plans to resume individual training at their sport centre.
But rules published by Sassuolo made clear that none of their coaches or other staff will be involved in the sessions.
Up to six players on an open pitch at a time will be allowed and they will be barred from using the changing rooms to minimise the threat of contagion.
Serie A clubs unanimously voted on Friday to finish the 2019-20 season - suspended since March 9 with Juventus leading Lazio by a point.
But Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora noted this week the chances of a restart were "increasingly narrow".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Roma to resume training as Serie A clubs eye return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Roma will resume training activities next week amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Serie A team announced.
The 2019-20 Serie A season has been suspended since March due to the COVID-19 crisis, which has killed more than 244,500 people worldwide.
All teams in Italy are set to return to training on May 18, the day after the government's existing lockdown measures expire, but some are scheduled to resume earlier.
A decree issued by the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy on Thursday opened the door for Sassuolo, SPAL, Bologna and Parma to return to training next week.
Sassuolo were the first team to announce a resumption of training on Saturday, although social distancing rules must be complied with and there can be no mass gatherings.
And Roma followed suit, saying in a statement: "#ASRoma would like to thank the Lazio Regione for its sensitivity towards team sports.
"Next week, Roma players will undergo medical assessments and begin individual training sessions – observing safe distancing guidelines – at the Trigoria training centre."
An emergency meeting of Lega Serie A was held on Friday during which it was reported all 20 teams agreed to resume the campaign rather than follow the examples of the Eredivisie and Ligue 1, which ended their respective seasons amid the coronavirus pandemic.
After Italy's sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora warned the government could step in to bring the season to a conclusion if an agreement on medical protocols for the resumption of matches was not reached, Lega Serie A president Paolo Dal Pino's call for a united approach was seemingly heeded.
Defending champions Juventus were a point clear of Lazio through 26 games at the time of postponement.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is lifting Italians’ stay-at-home orders and permitting restaurants to resume takeout service next week.
But Conte has delayed announcing a restart to the Serie A season for fear of another spike in contagions for a disease that has officially killed 28,710 in Italy – second only to the United States.
Conte is only allowing clubs to resume team training on May 18.
Several regions that have avoided the worst of the outbreak say they will use a loophole to individual players to start training on Monday.
The voluntary sessions will affect teams such as Napoli in the south and the central Emilia-Romagna region’s Bologna and Parma.
Rome’s Lazio have also voiced plans to resume individual training at their sport centre.
But rules published by Sassuolo made clear that none of their coaches or other staff will be involved in the sessions.
Up to six players on an open pitch at a time will be allowed and they will be barred from using the changing rooms to minimise the threat of contagion.
Serie A clubs unanimously voted on Friday to finish the 2019-20 season — suspended since March 9 with Juventus leading Lazio by a point.
But Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora noted this week the chances of a restart were “increasingly narrow”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Sassuolo become first Serie A club to announce return to training</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sassuolo have become the first Serie A team to announce a resumption of training activities amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Optional individual sessions will be allowed to take place at the Mapei Football Center from Monday, although social distancing rules must be complied with and there can be no mass gatherings.
A decree issued by the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy on Thursday opened the door for Sassuolo, SPAL, Bologna and Parma to return to training next week.
The rest of the Serie A clubs have to wait until at least May 18, which is the day after the Italian government's existing lockdown measures are due to expire.
A Sassuolo statement read: "Players will only be allowed access to the pitches in compliance with rules of social distancing, while access to the Sports Center (locker rooms, gyms, offices) will be prohibited.
"The individual sessions, which will take place during the mornings from Monday to Friday, with the use of three fields, with six players per hour (one player for each half of the pitch), will not be attended by the technical staff, while an emergency health supervision will be guaranteed."
It was reported on Friday that all 20 Serie A clubs had voted to see out the rest of the 2019-20 season, which has been suspended since March 9 due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
A date for the return of competitive fixtures is yet to be confirmed.
While the Premier League, Bundesliga and LaLiga are also committed to finishing the campaign, the Eredivisie and Ligue 1 this week cancelled their seasons prematurely.
There have been over 209,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths in Italy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul Pogba provides new Manchester United injury update</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paul Pogba has revealed he is working hard on his fitness to be ready for when football makes a return.
The Manchester United midfielder has missed big chunks of the season with separate ankle injuries, the second of which required surgery in January. His last United appearance came on Boxing Day against Newcastle, but Pogba hasn't started a game for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side since September.
But with football currently on hold as the nation implements social distancing rules to limit the coronavirus pandemic, Pogba is working on his fitness and football skills alone.
He is confident of being fit and ready to play a key role for United when the Premier League is back.
“I have a little home gym in my house,“ Pogba told United's official website. ”I can do some training, some running, some bike, go outside and do some things with the ball. I am just keeping busy and keeping healthy. “We have got to stay motivated, there is no other choice. It is a period and we don't know until when it will be like this, but I still have goals in my head and one day hopefully this [pandemic] will stop. “And then we have to get back on the pitch, so we have to be ready. For myself, I have been out for a long time as well, so for me I just want to come back playing football.”
Pogba also gave some fitness advice to those trying to stay in shape from home during the lockdown, with gyms around the country all closed at the time of writing.
“My advice first of all is to stay safe, stay at home and keep practising,” he added. “There is always a way to work, you can work with anything you have at home, you can still do sit-ups, push-ups. “For abdominals and core work, you don't need weights and stuff like that. You just need the work.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul Pogba to be convinced to stay at Man Utd with promise of Bruno Fernandes partnership</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has made plans to make Paul Pogba a key part of Manchester United's future.
And he's told World Cup winner Pogba he wants him to build a midfield partnership with Bruno Fernandes to provide a pathway back to glory for United when football resumes.
Pogba's fit and ready to play when football restarts with United's medical staff satisfied the 27 year-old Frenchman is totally recovered from the ankle problems that wrecked his season before the Coronavirus pandemic struck.
United's medical team have assessed Pogba via the individual fitness data from apps given to the players while in lockdown and declared him fit and ready for action.
Solskjaer has told Pogba he'll be straight back in the team as soon as games start up again with the star ready and focused to put his troubles behind him.
United's Norwegian boss is excited at the prospect of a Fernandes-Pogba midfield axis behind Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial with Scott McTominay a key component in one of the two holding roles.
Senior United sources say Pogba – who has two years left on his contract - believes his immediate future is at Old Trafford with a big money move unlikely for at least a year or more due to the world health carnage caused by Covid-19.
We're testing a new site: This content is coming soon
Football's transfer market will be unrecognisable when the window re-opens with traditional big spending European clubs like Real Madrid said to be hit hard by the global crisis.
And Pogba knows it's unlikely any club will be able to pay the near £100 million needed to sign him – or stump up the £290,000 a week the Frenchman gets paid by United.
That's why United believe the 27-year-old midfielder has reassessed his situation – and why his controversial agent Mino Raiola is adopting a lower profile.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Icelandic actor and strongman Hafthor Bjornsson set a world record for the deadlift on Saturday when he lifted 1,104 pounds (501 kg) at Thor’s Power Gym in Iceland, reported Reuters. 
Bjornsson, best known for his portrayal of Ser Gregor ‘The Mountain’ Clegane on the popular HBO series Game of Thrones, broke the record previously held by Briton Eddie Hall who in 2016 became the first man to lift 500 kg.
The event was streamed live on ESPN here and Bjornsson, 31, lifted the barbell that was bending and straining under the weights, holding it for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight.
Bjornsson, who is six feet and nine inches tall, is also the winner of the World’s Strongest Man competition from back in 2018.
Speaking in a “behind-the-scenes” video posted on YouTube, Bjornsson said: “I’m extremely proud, you know. I’m extremely happy. It’s great – there’s nothing better than proving people wrong. So many people didn’t believe in me, so many people that said, ‘501 kg is never going to go up’… But I also had a lot of support.”
“I feel healthy, I feel good. I’m just absolutely speechless, even though I’m talking a lot now. But I’m excited, super excited – this is huge for me,” he added ecstatically.

    <h5 class="mb-1">“Game Of Thrones” Actor Hafthor Bjornsson Breaks World Deadlift Record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hafthor Bjornsson, who played Ser Gregor Clegane, better known as ‘The Mountain’ in “Game of Thrones” has set a new deadlifting world record.
Bjornsson, 31, broke the previous record held by Eddie Hall in 2016 for lifting 500 kilograms (1,102 pounds). On Saturday, Bjornsson lifted 1,104 pounds (501 kilograms) at Thor’s Power Gym in Iceland.
The actor and strongman completed the lift as the barbell bent and strained under the weights. He held the lift for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight.
On Instagram, he said;
“I have no words. What an amazing day, one I will remember for the rest of my life. I said I was coming for it, and once I set my mind on something, I’m a dog with a bone. I want to give a huge shoutout to my family, friends, coaches, fans, sponsors and haters, all of whom helped this lift be possible.”
Bjornsson, who is 6 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 452 pounds had won the World’s Strongest Man competition in 2018 and has earned third place or higher every year since 2012. He is the first person to have won the Arnold Strongman Classic, Europe’s Strongest Man and World’s Strongest Man in the same calendar year.

Having already won the Arnold Strongman Classic and the World’s Strongest Man, among many other competitions, the 31-year-old has also now broken another world record.
After initial reps of 420 kg and 465 kg, Björnsson deadlifted 501 kg to go past a record that has held through since 2016. The 6-foot-9 Icelandic strongman beat the previous record set by the UK’s Eddie Hall, who was the first to ever deadlift 500 kg.
Interestingly enough, Björnsson also wants to KO the previous record holder next, saying he’s signed a very lucrative offer for a boxing match with Hall.
“Something new and big,” Thor said when asked what was next for him. “Core Sports just offered me a seven-figure contract, the biggest contract of my life. I’ve signed it already.
“Hall has been running his mouth for some weeks, and I know he got the same deal, same contract. So Eddie, I just knocked out your record, and now I’m ready to knock you out in the ring,” Björnsson said. “Time to put your fists where your big mouth is, and sign the Core Sports contract. I’m ready.”
Björnsson, who is also a former professional basketball player, did dabble with some martial arts training in the past. In 2015, the massive athlete was also on camera having a friendly sparring match with Conor McGregor in Ireland.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Game of Thrones' actor Hafthór Björnsson breaks deadlifting world record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In an electric display of power, Icelandic strongman and Game of Thrones actor Hafþór (Hafthor) Björnsson broke the deadlift world record Saturday, picking up 501 kilograms (nearly 1,105 pounds) of weight.
Björnsson, who played Ser Gregor Clegane aka The Mountain on Game of Thrones, made his deadlift world record attempt on Saturday, which was broadcast live on ESPN and streamed on YouTube. The previous record was set at 500 kilograms (about 1,102 pounds) by Eddie Hall in 2016.
The record-breaking lift is incredible to watch. His form from the start to the end is spectacular and his lockout at the top is uncharacteristically stable. Many lifters would wobble when attempting a personal record, but the 31-year-old looks like a rock.
The lifting event took place in Iceland, which with its small population of just 364,000, has been operating on lighter social distancing measures than other European countries. (Gatherings of more than 20 are banned through Monday; it's unclear exactly how many attended this event, but in footage, the gym looks sparsely populated.) The country has recorded only 10 COVID-19 deaths; Iceland implemented mass testing and contact tracing early on. Before Björnsson took the stage, event commentators described the attempt as something to look forward to amid the coronavirus crisis.
Before hitting the record, Björnsson warmed up by lifting 420 kilograms (roughly 926 pounds) and 465 kilograms (approximately 1,025 pounds), which means he pulled up a grand total of 1,386 kilograms (nearly 3,056 pounds) over three rounds that day.
After breaking the world record and taking a few minutes to kiss his wife, catch his breath, and cool down, Björnsson said in an interview that he was thankful he had the opportunity to attempt this record despite everything that's going on in the world. 
"Not only did I pull this incredible weight, but I also just feel great afterwards," he said, noting that he didn't get any injuries. "I believe today I could have done more but what's the point? I'm happy with this."
Björnsson also holds the world record for the elephant bar deadlift, which is the same lift but with a longer barbell, and won the World's Strongest Man competition in 2018.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While live sports are at a standstill as present as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, that didn't stop 'Game of Thrones' star Hafthor Björnsson from writing his name into the record books on Saturday.
According to the ESPN website, Björnsson, who played Ser Gregor Clegane aka "The Mountain" on the hit show, deadlifted a record 1 104 pounds (501kg) at his Iceland home.
Björnsson, 31, beat the previous record of 1 102 pounds (500kg), set by England's Eddie Hall in 2016.
The 6-foot-9, 441-pound (200kg) Björnsson won the World's Strongest Man title in 2018 and has finished in the top three on seven other occasions.
He has also been Iceland's Strongest Man for nine straight years and won Europe's Strongest Man each of the past three years.
The deadlift is a weight training exercise in which a loaded barbell or bar is lifted off the ground to the level of the hips, perpendicular to the floor, before being placed back on the ground. It is one of the three powerlifting exercises, along with the squat and bench press.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Games of Thrones' Hafthor Bjornsson Smahes World Deadlift Record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“Game of Thrones” actor best known to fans as favorite Ser Gregor “The Mountain” Clegane, Hafthor Björnsson, crushed the world record on Saturday by deadlifting 1,104 lbs. (501kg).
Björnsson, who stands 6 feet, 9 inches tall and weighs 450 pounds, set the new record for deadlifting (a lift made from a standing position in which a loaded barbell or bar is raised off the ground to the level of the hips) at his home gym in Reykjavík, Iceland.
Watch the incredible lift below:
Björnsson warmed up by deadlifting 926 pounds (420kg), then on his next set deadlifted 1,025 pounds (465kg) for his second attempt before the record attempt at 1,104 pound (501kg). He took 15 minutes between each lift.
Former deadlift champion and 2017 World’s Strongest Man winner Eddie Hall — who set the record previously in 2016 — had earlier disputed the event “in [Björnsson’s] home gym with a bunch of [his] pals.”
“I genuinely look forward to having my record broken & seeing what is possible,” Hall wrote in an Instagram post. “I think you are probably the man to do it, there’s no denying that & I’ll still shake your hand afterwards and say well done… if you do it under the appropriate conditions.”
After besting Hall’s record, Björnsson had a message for him: “Eddie, I know I just knocked out your record. Now I’m ready to knock you out in the ring. Time to put your fists where your big mouth is and sign the Core Sports contract.”
To conclude his run as “The Mountain,” whom Björnsson had portrayed since Season 4, on the fifth episode of the show’s eighth and final season, fans finally got the fight they had been waiting for.
Known as “CleganeBowl,” the episode saw The Mountain go mano-a-mano with his brother Sandor, aka “The Hound,” in a brutal action-packed brawl that saw the brothers fighting to the death high atop the Red Keep in Kings Landing. The Hound threw himself onto The Mountain through a cracked stone wall, and they both fell to their deaths in the fiery wreckage below.

“I have no words. What an amazing day, one I will remember for the rest of my life. I said I was coming for it, and once I set my mind on something, I’m a dog with a bone. I want to give a huge shoutout to my family, friends, coaches, fans, sponsors and haters, all of whom helped this lift be possible,” he wrote on Instagram.
He also won the World’s Strongest Man competition in 2018.
The Mountain was first played by Conan Stevens and Ian Whyte until Bjornsson took over in season 4 of the hit HBO show.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Icelandic actor and strongman Hafthor Bjornsson set a world record for the deadlift on Saturday when he lifted 1,104 lb (501 kg) at Thor’s Power Gym in Iceland.

Bjornsson, 31, completed the lift as the barbell bent and strained under the weights. He held the lift for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight.
“I believe today I could’ve done more, but what’s the point?” Bjornsson said. “I’m happy with this. My family and friends, they were happy with this, and I’ve decided to call it.”
Bjornsson, who is 6ft 9in and weighs 452 lb (205 kg), won the World’s Strongest Man competition in 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">He really is The Mountain! 6ft 9ins Game of Thrones star Hafþór Björnsson breaks the world deadlifting record by lifting 1,104lbs - and thinks he could have shifted MORE if he'd had a crowd</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Game of Thrones star Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson has broken the world deadlift record at an event held in Iceland.
Incredible footage shows the 31-year-old actor lifting a whopping 1,104 pounds (501 kg) off the ground inside Thor's Power Gym in Reykjavík on Saturday.
Björnsson  - who is best known for playing Ser Gregor 'The Mountain' Clegane on the hit HBO series - has now smashed a record previously set by Briton Eddie Hall. 
Back in 2016,  Hall made international headlines after he lifted 1,102 pounds (500 kg). 
Björnsson's deadlift was streamed live on ESPN Saturday, with footage showing him lifting a barbell that was bending and straining under the massive amount of weights. 
The star held the barbell for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight.
The event took place without a crowd, due to current restrictions on large gatherings that have been put in place due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
In Iceland, no more than 20 people can currently gather in one place. 
Björnsson only completed the deadlift in the company of his doctor, referee and film crew.  
Afterward he told ESPN: 'I'm obviously speechless..'I'm over the moon.'
Björnsson even bragged that he could possibly lift even more weight if he had a crowd. 
He previously told the New York Post that he performs 'maybe 10 percent better in a competition — the crowd gives you that adrenaline rush that you need'.
But the strongman was simply happy to take the world record.  
He stated on Saturday: 'I'm standing here, tall, feeling good, no injuries. I'm healthy as well. I believe today I could have done more, but what's the point? I'm happy with this.'
Bjornsson, who is six feet and nine inches tall, won the World's Strongest Man competition in 2018.
 He played 'The Mountain' - a famous knight loyal to the Lannisters - on Game of Thrones between seasons four and eight. His character was killed in the penultimate episode of the series.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Game of Thrones star Hafthor Julius Bjornsson smashes deadlift world record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Game of Thrones star Hafthor Julius Bjornsson has set a new world record by deadlifting 501kg (1,105lbs) at his gym in Iceland.
The Icelandic strongman, who played the Mountain in the smash-hit HBO series, broke the previous record held by Brit Eddie Hall.
It has taken four years for someone to beat Hall’s effort, with Bjornsson lifting just 1kg more than his rival.
The coronavirus pandemic meant Bjornsson had to attempt the world record at his gym and seek official recognition for the lift as it was out of competition.
Magnus Ver Magnusson officiated the deadlift after two successful warm-ups at 420kg and 460kg.
Bjornsson, who has one World’s Strongest Man title, was elated after he managed to break the record.
He said: ‘I’m absolutely speechless, so happy and thankful. Blessed. Everything went according to plans, I’m over the moon.
‘I believe today I could’ve done more, but what’s the point? I’m happy with this.’
The world record attempt attracted controversy and Bjornsson is now eager to settle his rivalry with Hall in a boxing match.
‘Wow… something new and big,’ Bjornsson said when asked what was next.
‘Core Sports just offered me a seven figure contract, which is the biggest contract of my life. I’ve signed it already.
‘Eddie Hall has been running his mouth for two weeks now and I now that he got the same deal.
‘So Eddie, I just knocked out your record, and now I’m ready to knock you out in the ring.
‘Time to put your fists where your big mouth is and sign the Core Sports contract.
‘I’m ready. Are you ready, Eddie?’

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Mountain from Game of Thrones breaks world record for heaviest deadlift</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hafthor Bjornsson is officially the first man in history to deadlift 501kg after his world-record attempt this afternoon.
The Icelandic strongman, who played Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane in the HBO series Game of Thrones, set out to break the previous record set by British strongman Eddie Hall.
And the 6ft 9in actor succeeded, smashing the record surrounded by a small crowd due to Covid-19 distancing rules.
Thor - as he is popularly known - streamed the attempt to the world via different media platforms and was overjoyed as he smashed Hall's record, with over 330,000 tuning in via RogueSport's Youtube channel.
His first two lifts of the afternoon were 420kg and 465kg, which he breezed through with little fuss.
After another 15-minute break, Bjornsson stepped up for the moment we'd all been waiting for and didn't disappoint.
The man mountain struggled more so than he had on previous attempts but made history, sending his camp wild in the gym as the referee gave his lift the all clear.
Bjornsson had put blood, sweat and tears into his preparation for the event, following a strict training routine and a complex diet.
“Usually I like to get around eight hours before I’m up around 8am in the morning,” the ambassador for REIGN Total Body Fuel, a new energy drink for fitness in the UK, told the Daily Star.
“Then I’ll make myself a breakfast. I’ll have six packs of 200g of rice. I’ll put some chicken in it.
“I’ll have my second meal of the day, again with rice with mince, rib eye steak or some kind of other steak. I have one more meal before I train.
"Then I’ll have a can of REIGN for my workout so I can get the caffeine I need for my session. After my session, I have a mother meal similar. Basically, I eat the same throughout the day.
“I’ll add spinach and carrots for my diet and eat that around six times a day. It’s very simple. But very effective.
“You basically have to be obsessed and consistent with everything you do from your sleep routine to your diet routine. People always wonder what the secret is to become the world’s strongest man.
“There is no real secret: it’s just about how you work and being consistent. "
British strongman Eddie Hall set the record back in 2016, lifting 500 kg under strongman rules.
The 32-year-old starred in a 2019 TV show entitled: " The Strongest Man in History."

I believe today I could have done more, but what’s the point? I’m happy with this. My family and friends, they’re happy. And I’ve decided to call it."
Bjornsson also called out Hall to a boxing match — not the first time they. have hinted at a fight — after breaking the record.
"I just knocked out your record and now I’m ready to knock you out in the ring," Bjornsson said. "Time to put your fist where your big mouth is and sign the CoreSports contract. I’m ready. Are you ready, Eddie?"
Hall, to his credit, wished Bjornsson luck ahead of his world-record attempt.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hafthor Bjornsson is best known for portraying 'The Mountain' in hit TV series Game of Thrones but he was not playing around on Saturday.
The 2018 World's Strongest Man winner set a world record with a 501-kilogram deadlift in front of a small gathering of people in a Reykjavik gym.
After lifting 420kg and 465kg in his first two attempts, the 6ft 9in, 200kg bodybuilder made history.
Bjornsson appeared to complete the deadlift comfortably and after locking into position the iron was thrown to the floor.
"I'm absolutely speechless. I'm just so happy and thankful that I got the opportunity to do this, even though the world is going through what it's going through," said Bjornsson.
"Everything went according to plan. I'm over the moon.
"I believe today I could've done more, but what's the point? I'm happy with this, my family and friends were happy with this and I decided to call it."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Teams worried about coronavirus affecting older staff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NBA will have to decide who is considered essential game staff should play resume amid the coronavirus pandemic, ESPN reported.
One of the concerns weighing on NBA teams is the age of people typically deemed essential to a team, such as a member of the coaching staff or a general manager, or whether they have a preexisting medical condition.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified people 65 or older or people of any age with an underlying medical condition as being more susceptible to COVID-19.
“Based on all the information that we have today, probably people over 60 with preexisting conditions can’t go, for sure, no matter what their titles are,” one unidentified general manager told ESPN. “Whether it’s a father of the star player or whether it’s the general manager of the team, they can’t go there.”
Currently, there are six NBA head coaches who are 60 and older, with three 65 and older: Alvin Gentry, New Orleans Pelicans, 65; Mike D’Antoni, Houston Rockets, 68; and Gregg Popovich, San Antonio Spurs, 71.
Who will be determined essential will lead to tough choices and the potential for hurt feelings, but general managers told ESPN medical staff likely won’t be cut.
“The one area you don’t want to skimp on is the medical. The coaching part of it, you could probably get by with a head coach, that’s it,” one general manager said.
As of Saturday, nearly 1.1 million people in the United States had been diagnosed with the coronavirus, with 64,283 deaths.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dave Kitson apologises for response to Raheem Sterling abuse</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dave Kitson has apologised for the "clumsy language" he used in an interview two years ago when analysing the racist abuse suffered by Raheem Sterling.
Kitson - a former Reading, Portsmouth and Stoke forward - has put himself forward as a potential replacement for Gordon Taylor as head of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA).
However, there has been something of a backlash against Kitson's possible candidacy, owing to remarks he made in an interview with TalkSport after Manchester City forward Sterling was racially abused during a game against Chelsea in 2018.
Kitson told the Daily Mirror his words were being misrepresented and he was actually expressing sympathy for Sterling - having been the victim of abuse on social media himself - but also said he was sorry for the way he had expressed himself.
He said: "I'd looked down Raheem's social media feed and that, while in the beginning it was about his cars and houses, I was pleased to see he had changed it, because there is a lot of jealousy out there, and I knew what it was like to have been on the end of unwarranted abuse.
"I said that it gave people a reason to dislike him as a person.
"Not that he had done anything wrong on his social media account but it gave certain people a platform to vent their ill-informed, ugly views.
"But I'm distressed that this has somehow morphed into a suggestion I condoned the shocking abuse Raheem suffered or that he otherwise asked for it. Nothing could be further from the truth."Perhaps I used clumsy language and for that I apologise.
"But I never have and never will condone any form of racism.
"I admire Raheem for taking up the fight and saying: 'No, I'm not having this.' And I agree with him.
"More needs to be done. And I'm prepared to do it."
Darren Lewis of the Daily Mirror told Sky Sports: "Until today - the timing of which people can make their own minds up about - I haven't really had an acceptable response from Dave in relation to the comments he made in a radio interview after Raheem Stering was racially abused.
"He appeared at the time to be suggesting that Sterling was bringing the racial abuse on himself.
"I would have liked to have seen him come out and address the strong reaction to those comments at the time.
"Doing it now he wants to run the organisation of which a huge contingent are black players, former and current, it does not resonate with a lot of people - and I am sure those people will be coming out to make their views clear."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dave Kitson's bid to become the players' union chief has been opposed by former Arsenal striker Ian Wright, while the head of anti-racist campaign group Kick It Out has raised concerns over his past comments about England forward Raheem Sterling.
REUTERS: Dave Kitson's bid to become the players' union chief has been opposed by former Arsenal striker Ian Wright, while the head of anti-racist campaign group Kick It Out has raised concerns over his past comments about England forward Raheem Sterling.
Ex-player Kitson is aiming to replace Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) chief Gordon Taylor, who has been at the helm since 1981, saying the body's response to the COVID-19 crisis was "an absolute embarrassment".
However, Kitson's anti-racism stance was questioned when a 2018 video resurfaced in which he said that although he did not condone racism, players such as Sterling "make themselves a target" because of how they portray themselves on social media.
"Look at this rubbish. Same person now running to lead the PFA," former England striker Wright wrote on Twitter https://twitter.com/IanWright0/status/1256124517895884801. "How can the PFA claim to take racism seriously when this is a candidate's views?
"He's literally blaming a victim of abuse saying they bring it on themselves," Wright added in response to another tweet.
Kick It Out head Sanjay Bhandari said Kitson's remarks did not inspire confidence in dealing with black players.
"Anyone who has aspirations to lead the PFA in the future must have in mind the best interests of all players," Bhandari told The Guardian https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/01/dave-kitson-faces-backlash-from-black-players-in-bid-to-become-head-of-pfa.
"Given Dave Kitson's previous remarks, I would be deeply concerned about his ability to represent black players. He needs to win their confidence and I doubt he can do that."
Kitson responded by telling The Guardian: "My objective is to ensure that the policies of the union reflect the needs and aspirations of all its members.
"Very importantly, that must include a much more effective anti-racism policy," added the 40-year-old who played as a striker for several clubs including Reading, Stoke City, Portsmouth and Sheffield United.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jeff Smith edged out Ricky Evans in a final-match decider to top the PDC Home Tour’s Group 16 on Saturday night.
Evans needed to win by three legs or more to top the group and led 3-2 after coming from behind.
But the contest went to a decider and Smith produced a 147 checkout that also ended the hopes of Martin Atkins, who would have finished top if Evans had won 5-3 or 5-4 after a tight battle also involving Germany’s Christian Bunse.
“I didn’t really have much choice,” Smith said of his final flourish. “It was great darts again. Ricky put up a good fight but I’ll take that win every day.
“That’s how tight the PDC is. There are 128 players and every single player can beat you. I thought I was gone when I lost against Martin but Christian, thank you very much, and let’s keep going.”
Smith opened his night with a convincing 5-1 win over Bunse, sealing victory with a 10-dart finish on the bullseye, but was then beaten 5-4 by Atkins, who had himself opened with a 5-2 victory over Evans.
Evans rebounded with victory over Bunse as gremlins hit the broadcast. Technical issues meant coverage was lost for around 10 minutes, with Evans 3-0 up on Bunse when normal service was resumed.
The German reduced the deficit to 3-1 and then took the next two legs to level the contest, only for Evans to regain his composure and wrap up a 5-3 victory.
Bunse belatedly found form in the next game as he took a 5-2 victory over Atkins that left the door open for Smith.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The US will likely see the return of NASCAR and the PGA before football, basketball, and hockey amid the coronavirus pandemic. Here's why., Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dr. Anthony Fauci said it might be challenging for major sports to return in the US this year.
“Safety, for the players and for the fans, trumps everything,” he told the New York Times on Tuesday. “If you can’t guarantee safety, then, unfortunately, you’re going to have to bite the bullet and say, ‘We may have to go without this sport for this season.'”
While the option to live-stream events makes eliminating fans easy, there’s no way around the fact that the new coronavirus typically spreads when droplets pass between people in sustained, close proximity. What’s more, experts have discovered that between 25% and 50% of people infected with COVID-19 show no symptoms when they’re infections.
So unless athletes who play football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and hockey – all contact sports, really – and their support staff test negative before competing in games, it’s impossible to eliminate the risk of the virus spreading during sporting events.
And right now, according to Fauci, the US doesn’t have the testing capability to make that a reality.
“I would love to be able to have all sports back,” Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said. “But as a health official and a physician and a scientist, I have to say, right now, when you look at the country, we’re not ready for that yet.”
At the beginning of the US’s outbreak, the lack of available testing ruffled feathers. Celebrities and athletes jumped the testing lines amid harsh criticism. On March 11, the state of Oklahoma used 60% of its testing capacity on NBA players and team staff after a member of the Utah Jazz tested positive, allowing them to bypass the long waits endured by ordinary citizens waiting for tests.
Now, more than 6.5 million Americans have been tested so far for the coronavirus; the US testing-per-capita rate is among the highest in the world. But given the country’s staggering case count and dearth of commensurate tests, still not every American who wants a test can get one.
This raises issues for professional leagues who may want to use widespread testing among their teams to clear athletes to play. Team commissioners and owners said they don’t want to secure tests for players in the current environment, AP reported Friday.
“We would have to ensure that testing is widely available and front-line health care workers have access before we begin talking about regular testing in the context of professional sports,” NBA spokesman Mike Bass told AP.
The number of tests needed to get professional contact sports going is staggering. About 3,000 kits would need to be available for Major League Baseball players, staff, and broadcasters for every round of testing, AP reported. Even if the National Hockey League and NBA returned with a smaller number of teams for their respective postseasons, those leagues would likely need 1,000 tests each time. And there’s no metric in place for how often these rounds of tests would need to happen (plus, some test results can take one to two days).
And even if teams were able to obtain the number of necessary tests without taking them away from Americans who needed them, players and staff would steal need to aggressively isolate themselves from society, Fauci said.
“You’ve got to be really creative. That’s going to be more difficult and more problematic,” he told the New York Times.
If teams are going to play contact sports without an audience, according to Fauci, it would be important “to test all the players and make sure they’re negative and keep them in a place where they don’t have contact with anybody on the outside who you don’t know whether they’re positive or negative.”
He added: “In other words, we said that for baseball, get the players in Major League Baseball, get a couple of cities and a couple of hotels, get them tested and keep them segregated. I know it’s going to be difficult for them not to be out in society, but that may be the price you pay if you want to play ball.”
And not all ballplayers are on board with that idea.
“What are you going to do with family members?” Mike Trout, the Los Angeles Angels outfielder, asked during an NBC Sports Network interview.
“My wife is pregnant, what am I going to do when she goes into labor? Am I going to have to quarantine for two weeks after I come back? Because obviously I can’t miss that birth of our first child. So, there’s a lot of red flags, there’s a lot of questions,” Trout said.
Some sports like golf and NASCAR racing, which are better suited to social distancing, could return sooner amid the coronavirus pandemic – even without testing. Golfers could stagger their tee times on courses and walk solo between holes; NASCAR racers already compete individually in their respective cars.
The PGA announced in April it hoped to restart in two months’ time, according to ESPN, though its chief of operations Tyler Dennis said it hadn’t yet determined how much coronavirus testing might be needed for golfers.
On Thursday, NASCAR announced it would return to live racing (with fans, of course) on May 17 in South Carolina, the Wall Street Journal reported. Attendees will have their temperatures checked and the use of protective equipment and social distancing measures will be required at the venue.
But NASCAR will not be testing drivers and their staff.
“Those tests remain in short supply,” NASCAR vice president of racing operations John Bobo told AP. “Getting results can take two to three days. Really, those tests should be targeted for people most in need.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The US will likely see the return of NASCAR and the PGA before football, basketball, and hockey amid the coronavirus pandemic. Here's why.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dr. Anthony Fauci said it might be challenging for major sports to return in the US this year.
“Safety, for the players and for the fans, trumps everything,” he told the New York Times on Tuesday. “If you can’t guarantee safety, then, unfortunately, you’re going to have to bite the bullet and say, ‘We may have to go without this sport for this season.'”
While the option to live-stream events makes eliminating fans easy, there’s no way around the fact that the new coronavirus typically spreads when droplets pass between people in sustained, close proximity. What’s more, experts have discovered that between 25% and 50% of people infected with COVID-19 show no symptoms when they’re infections.
So unless athletes who play football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and hockey – all contact sports, really – and their support staff test negative before competing in games, it’s impossible to eliminate the risk of the virus spreading during sporting events.
And right now, according to Fauci, the US doesn’t have the testing capability to make that a reality.
“I would love to be able to have all sports back,” Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said. “But as a health official and a physician and a scientist, I have to say, right now, when you look at the country, we’re not ready for that yet.”
At the beginning of the US’s outbreak, the lack of available testing ruffled feathers. Celebrities and athletes jumped the testing lines amid harsh criticism. On March 11, the state of Oklahoma used 60% of its testing capacity on NBA players and team staff after a member of the Utah Jazz tested positive, allowing them to bypass the long waits endured by ordinary citizens waiting for tests.
Now, more than 6.5 million Americans have been tested so far for the coronavirus; the US testing-per-capita rate is among the highest in the world. But given the country’s staggering case count and dearth of commensurate tests, still not every American who wants a test can get one.
This raises issues for professional leagues who may want to use widespread testing among their teams to clear athletes to play. Team commissioners and owners said they don’t want to secure tests for players in the current environment, AP reported Friday.
“We would have to ensure that testing is widely available and front-line health care workers have access before we begin talking about regular testing in the context of professional sports,” NBA spokesman Mike Bass told AP.
The number of tests needed to get professional contact sports going is staggering. About 3,000 kits would need to be available for Major League Baseball players, staff, and broadcasters for every round of testing, AP reported. Even if the National Hockey League and NBA returned with a smaller number of teams for their respective postseasons, those leagues would likely need 1,000 tests each time. And there’s no metric in place for how often these rounds of tests would need to happen (plus, some test results can take one to two days).
And even if teams were able to obtain the number of necessary tests without taking them away from Americans who needed them, players and staff would steal need to aggressively isolate themselves from society, Fauci said.
“You’ve got to be really creative. That’s going to be more difficult and more problematic,” he told the New York Times.
If teams are going to play contact sports without an audience, according to Fauci, it would be important “to test all the players and make sure they’re negative and keep them in a place where they don’t have contact with anybody on the outside who you don’t know whether they’re positive or negative.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Patriots Star Has Brutally Honest Comment On Bill Belichick</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A former New England Patriots star has weighed in on Tom Brady’s decision to leave the franchise in free agency.
Asante Samuel played for the Patriots from 2003-07. He was part of two Super Bowl champion teams during his time in New England.
The All-Pro cornerback went on to play for the Eagles and the Falcons before retiring in 2013. He had an honest admission about playing for Bill Belichick while discussing Brady’s decision.
“It worked out for me, man. It made me a better man, but it’s not something I enjoyed,” Samuel told TMZ Sports.
“(Tom) probably just got fed up with it at the end of the day.”
Samuel isn’t the first former Patriots player to say something like this. Former tight end Rob Gronkowski, who came out of retirement to play with Brady in Tampa Bay, admitted it can be tough to play for Belichick.
Both Samuel and Gronkowski have a great amount of respect for Belichick, but their comments are fair. At a certain point, players might get tired of the “Patriots way” and want to play elsewhere.
Brady and Gronkowski will look to have more fun in Tampa Bay in 2020.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former LSU running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire can thank Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes for his role in helping him land the No. 32 pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.
While speaking to reporters Friday, Mahomes revealed that General Manager Brett Veach unexpectedly texted him after the draft started to ask him what three players he would want on the team -- and Edwards-Helaire was the first name the Super Bowl Champ mentioned.
JAGUARS’ K’LAVON CHAISSON WANTS FORMER LSU TEAMMATE JOE BURROW TO BE FIRST SACK: I’LL ‘TAKE THAT FINE’
“I wanted to add to the offense, obviously to help me out and to help our team out. So, Clyde was the first name that came to mind and I know we have a great running back room already, so I think just bringing him in, I know he’ll fit right in and he’ll compete,” Mahomes said, according to Chiefs Wire.
“I think the first thing that stood out from Clyde is when the competition and the games got bigger, it seemed like he played better,” he continued. “I always like guys that can rise to the competition, and whenever you’re on the biggest stage, you play your best football, and you rise up and compete with your team.”
But for Mahomes, Edwards-Helaire offers more than just an advantage on the field.
“You can tell he’s a high-character guy,” Mahomes added. “He loves football.”

Edwards-Helaire led the SEC in rushing touchdowns with 16, he finished No. 2 in the conference in rushing yards, fourth in rushing yards per game (99.23), and he tied LSU’s single-season record for receptions by a running back with 50 catches. He rushed for 100 or more yards six times, all coming in the conference, and the Tigers were 6-0 in those games.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Andy Dalton blames messy Bengals exit for free-agency limbo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andy Dalton isn’t ripping the Bengals. It’s not his style. But the three-time Pro Bowl quarterback is clearly not thrilled with how his exit – or his final year in Cincinnati – played out.
Though it was obvious Dalton wasn’t going to be kept around after he was benched midway through the season and the team zeroed in on LSU star Joe Burrow with the first pick in the NFL Draft, he wasn’t officially let go until Thursday. And it may have hurt his chances to latch onto a new team that would’ve given him an opportunity to start.
“This year there were a good amount of quarterbacks that were available,” Dalton told the Bengals’ official website. “I think it would have worked out differently if I had been a free agent when the new league year started. I was still under contract and that hurt me.”
Dalton, 32, had been with the Bengals since 2011, when they took him with the 35th pick in the draft out of TCU. He led them to five straight playoff appearances from 2011-15, but his run came to an end last year as Cincinnati bottomed out and he threw 14 interceptions, compared to just 16 touchdowns, in 13 games. Dalton was benched just before the trade deadline and later led the Bengals to their only two wins of the year. He believed teams were in inclined to trade for him this offseason because they knew Cincinnati would eventually release him.
“I’m sure teams knew they [the Bengals] were going to take a quarterback No. 1 and they would release me and there was no reason to rush into anything,” Dalton said.
The situation was frustrating, since had he known earlier that the Bengals wanted to move on from him, he could’ve caught on somewhere else.
“I wish if [coach Zac Taylor] was thinking about it at least let me try to see if I could end up somewhere else or at least see if there’s interest in possibly getting traded,” Dalton told ESPN in October. “At that point, the way it was handled, there wasn’t enough time to even have that happen.”
The NFL Network reported Thursday that the Jaguars have “legitimate interest” in Dalton. The Patriots also appear to be a potential landing spot. Dalton was due to earn $17.7 million in 2020, the final season of a six-year contract extension he signed in August 2014.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Alex Smith is a supporter of Colin Kaepernick.
Smith held an interview on “The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz” on ESPN Radio on Friday and not only spoke about his injury that he is still rehabbing, but addressed his time playing with Colin Kaepernick in San Francisco.
The fact that Kaepernick still doesn’t have a job in the league, Smith said, is “absurd.”
During 10 starts in the 2012 regular season and playoffs, Kaepernick threw for 2,406 yards, 14 touchdowns and five interceptions while also racking up 502 rushing yards. The 49ers would go on to trade Smith to the Chiefs the following offseason.
After making it to another NFC Championship Game in Kaepernick’s first full season as the starter, the team would not qualify for the postseason in his final three years with the team.
Despite what people say, Kaepernick didn’t enter the 2016 season as the starter, not because he lost his job, but because he was working his way back from an injury to his left shoulder. The spotlight would soon be placed on him after he sat, then kneeled during the playing of the National Anthem that year.
He has remained unsigned since the end of the 2016 season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Bengals QB Andy Dalton Shares Advice For Joe Burrow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Cincinnati Bengals unofficially named Joe Burrow the starting quarterback for the 2020 season when they released Andy Dalton on Thursday. It marked the end of the TCU product’s long tenure with the franchise.
Dalton led the Bengals to a handful of playoff appearances, but the team just couldn’t get over the hump. Perhaps that will change now that Burrow is leading the charge.
Although he didn’t owe his former team anything, Dalton felt the need to share some advice to Burrow. It’s a classy move from the veteran quarterback, especially since he was just released by Cincinnati.
While there’s no doubt that Burrow will enter his rookie season with a ton of pressure on his shoulders, the message he received from Dalton could help his approach throughout this fall.
Here’s the advice that Dalton has for Burrow, via the team’s official website:
Dalton isn’t the only quarterback to give advice to Burrow. Earlier this week, former No. 1 pick David Carr had a few words of wisdom to share for the former Heisman Trophy winner.
Carr talked about the importance of speaking up and learn which plays he’s most comfortable running.
We’ll see if Burrow can handle sky-high expectations in Cincinnati as a rookie.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Alex Smith: It’s ‘so absurd’ that Colin Kaepernick doesn’t have a job in the NFL</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Washington Redskins quarterback Alex Smith is still recovering from the horrendous leg injury he suffered in 2018 — which was the subject of an ESPN documentary that premiered on Friday. 
Smith talked about that injury on “The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz” on ESPN Radio on Friday, but also addressed his time playing with Colin Kaepernick in San Francisco.
The fact that Kaepernick still doesn’t have a job in the league, Smith said, is “absurd.”
Kaepernick hasn’t played in the league since the 2016 season, when he started kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustices in the United States. He participated in a workout for teams in November, however it didn’t go according to plan. Commissioner Roger Goodell said shortly after that workout that “we’ve moved on.” Despite Kaepernick still trying to make a comeback, one doesn’t seem likely anytime soon. 
Smith was selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2005 draft by the 49ers, and spent his first eight seasons in the league there. He was replaced by Kaepernick during the 2012 season, his final with the team before joining the Kansas City Chiefs.
After taking over, Kaepernick threw for more than 2,600 yards and 14 touchdowns with just five interceptions in 10 starts that season, while completing 62.5 percent of his passes. While he took Smith’s job, which resulted in Smith being traded, Smith had nothing but good things to say about Kaepernick.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bill Belichick, Joe Burrow favorites for top coach, rookie awards</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As he enters a season full of unknowns, New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick is still considered a constant by oddsmakers. Caesars Sportsbook has posted Belichick as a 7-1 favorite to win the Coach of the Year award.
Tom Brady signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this offseason after a 20-year run with Belichick, leaving the Pats with inexperienced options or possibly a free agent at quarterback.
"If [Belichick] takes that roster and wins that division, and no other team goes 16-0, how do you give it to somebody else?" Caesars Sportsbook director of trading Jeff Davis told ESPN. "The only way he doesn't get it is if one of the teams that was terrible last year makes the playoffs."
The Dallas Cowboys were not terrible last season but did underachieve, finishing 8-8 and missing the playoffs, which led to the firing of coach Jason Garrett. Mike McCarthy now grabs the reins for the odds-on NFC East betting favorite (-105), and he is the second favorite to win the award at 9-1.
"I find it the most interesting betting market because it's not remotely related to how good of a coach you are. Mike McCarthy is second on the list and he's not in the top 20 in the NFL of pure coaching ability," Davis said. "If every guy gets the same roster, is Mike McCarthy going to be the second choice? No."
Davis stressed the critical roles that perception and expectations play. For example, Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur is tied for the longest odds at 100-1, after winning an NFC-high 13 games in his rookie season. "He can only win if they go 16-0 or 15-1 and that roster can't do that," Davis said.
This is the first year Nevada Gaming approved betting on Coach of the Year, as well as for Offensive Rookie of the Year. Joe Burrow, the No. 1 overall pick who is expected to open the season as the Cincinnati Bengals' starter, is the favorite for that award at 3-1.
"I'd rather take a bet at Burrow at 3-1 than be [liable] on one of these wide receivers or running backs at 15-1. Running backs have won it twice as much as quarterbacks and receivers combined," Davis said, explaining why he's offering such high odds for Burrow, whereas most other sportsbooks have him priced between 2-1 and 5-2. "Your learning curve from college to pro is the smallest at running back."
But recent rookie quarterbacks have seemingly made the transition more smoothly, once more college football programs started adopting the spread offense. In the past 17 seasons, eight quarterbacks have earned the offensive rookie honors.
However, while Burrow probably will have plenty of opportunity, the same cannot be said for the other three quarterbacks drafted in the first round. Tua Tagovailoa is 10-1, Justin Herbert is 30-1 and Jordan Love has 200-1 odds. None is projected to start his team's season opener.
Kansas City Chiefs running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire is the second favorite at 11-2.
"He's a first-round pick and has a lot of opportunity with a Super Bowl-winning team and the best offense in the league," Caesars Sportsbook oddsmaker Alan Berg told ESPN.
Long shots have won recent football awards. Reigning NFL MVP Lamar Jackson had 50-1 odds last summer and Patrick Mahomes had 100-1 odds for his award-winning 2018 season.
The Heisman Trophy has also cashed some impressive tickets. When Jackson won with Louisville, he was once offered at 100-1 odds. Burrow just capped off a 200-1 Heisman campaign with LSU.
Oddsmakers are on alert for both of these new additions to the betting menu, especially with scoring continuing to rise. Over the past decade, three rookies drafted outside the first round still managed to win Offensive Rookie of the Year.
"Usage in Week 1 is going to blow up the market big-time," Davis said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How should the Bucs treat the GOAT? Lessons from Tom Brady's ex-teammates</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TAMPA, Fla. -- For the first time in over two decades, six-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady is the new kid on the block -- playing for a new team in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in a new offense with new teammates. Well, mostly new teammates.
Brady will have longtime favorite target Rob Gronkowski to ease the transition. But to help Brady's new squad get better acquainted with him, ESPN spoke to a number of former teammates for tips on how best to work with Brady.
Former linebacker Tedy Bruschi, who was with the Patriots for four seasons before Brady's arrival and played with the quarterback from 2000 to '08, cautioned against falling into the trap of believing Brady can be the savior every Sunday, or what he calls "Brady-watching." You can see it when a receiver drops a pass or a safety gives up a touchdown early in the fourth quarter but doesn't feel a sense of urgency.
"They need to get over Brady-watching. Because they get to the sideline and all of a sudden it's like, 'It's OK, Tom will bail us out.' That's what I call Brady-watching," Bruschi said.
Brady's 45 game-winning drives from 2000 to '19 are the most of any quarterback in history.
"I'll be watching that early on with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, if they're Brady-watching or if they feel themselves as a team that everything is important, and not just when that guy right there is under center and everything is gonna magically happen," Bruschi said.
When Antoine Winfield Jr. was selected by the Bucs in the second round of the 2020 NFL draft, he gushed, "It's going to be crazy when I see [Brady] in person. He's one of my favorite players." (Winfield's father, Antoine Winfield Sr., played 14 NFL seasons and picked off Brady once back in 2001.)
But multiple former teammates emphasized that just because some Bucs players grew up with Brady posters on their walls and don't remember the NFL prior to Brady winning a Super Bowl, they can't be in awe of him.
"I'll say this right now," Bruschi said, "if those players see him as that four-letter word, they better get over it. The four-letter word is a word I will not use to describe him. It's that farm animal, it starts with G. I don't do that. Because that's almost like putting him on a pedestal. It's like, dude, you're still the same guy I intercepted in practice and took 20 bucks from. Come on, now.
"That's my one advice to his teammates right now. He is on a level plane as you, because he's gonna make mistakes, but he's also gonna make you better. And it can't be done without you. Don't look to him to do it. Our teams never did."
When Gronkowski came to the Patriots as a second-round draft pick in 2010, the notoriously intense Brady rode the fun-loving Gronk hard.
"He used to be mean to me," Gronkowski said in 2018, believing that he needed a "breaking-in" phase and to understand the expectations.
Their shared passion for winning ultimately made them one of the top quarterback-tight end tandems in the NFL for nine seasons. It's why Gronkowski expressed an interest in reuniting prior to his signing with Tampa Bay, despite retiring because of injuries after the 2018 season.
"He just brings that fire to the table," Gronkowski said after his trade to the Bucs was finalized. "There's no time when you're gonna be out at practice where he's not gonna be vocal, the intensity level's not gonna be high. You're always gonna be learning with Tom."
Brady might be a six-time Super Bowl winner, but tight end Christian Fauria, who played with Brady from 2002 to '05, said he needs unfiltered feedback from his teammates in order to learn their preferences and tendencies, especially from skill players such as wide receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, who are significantly younger and less experienced.
"I had a certain skill set. I couldn't run routes like certain guys," Fauria said. "I had to run 'em the way I had to run 'em and he needed to know that."
Brady also needs to know what players are seeing from the defense. If a safety is cheating on a high corner route, Brady needs to know the tight end won't be able to run that route but could instead run a bench route.
"Take ownership of your role just as much as he takes ownership of his role," Fauria said. "He's gonna hold you accountable, but you need to hold him accountable. ... It's not a dictatorship, it's a partnership. ... He's on a new team with new players and it's their offense -- it's not his offense. ... He's gonna have to learn just as much from them as they're gonna have to learn from him.
"There needs to be a lot of compromise and understanding and patience with how this relationship is developed. It's not a one-way street. ... There is a level of expectation and excellence that I think everybody strives for, but the fact is, he can't do it by himself. He's never done it by himself. ... The more you work at it and practice it and understand what he wants you to do when you both see it the same way -- that's how it develops into a championship mentality."
For former guard Rich Ohrnberger, who was a fourth-round pick by the Patriots in 2009, every practice felt like a game. You were expected to compete the way Brady did, and if you made a mistake, he would point it out.
"There was an expert at all things football just feet behind you," Ohrnberger said. "If you were having a lackadaisical day, he'd pick on you, he'd find you and make life tough for you."
One time Ohrnberger and a fellow offensive lineman were trying to pass off a defensive line stunt with the first-team offense, and two D-linemen shot into the backfield into Brady's face.
"We crashed into each other like cymbals," Ohrnberger said. "He was frustrated. [He] threw the ball at our feet. And he looked at me specifically and was like, 'What, they don't run E-Ts [end-tackle] at Penn State?'
"Even to this day, I can remember that feeling," Ohrnberger said, referring to Brady's tongue-lashing. "You go hot throughout your body. You feel like the entire world is staring at you for a moment, and then all of that passes. It's humiliating, but it makes an impact. It makes you want to do better. That was the goal every day, to do a better job."
Wide receiver Donté Stallworth, who had two stints with the Patriots, in 2007 and 2012, remembers one of his first practices with Brady during OTAs. On an in-route into the end zone, Brady threw what felt close to a perfect ball, but it was slightly behind Stallworth and it hit him in the chest. He dropped it.
"I should have easily caught the ball. He put it there, where if anyone was watching [it on] TV, they'd be like, 'Oh, he dropped that ball,'" Stallworth said. "I'm walking back to the huddle and I'm getting ready to like profusely apologize to Tommy. And I see him ... cussing, like, 'S---! F---!' And I'm like, 'Oh, I'm gonna get it now.'"
"I'm like, 'Tommy, my bad, man. Good throw, man. I've gotta have that,'" Stallworth said. Instead, it was Brady who apologized for not throwing him a better ball.
"He's like, 'No, man, that's on me. I've gotta put it in front of you,'" Stallworth said. "I'm looking at him like, for a minute I was like, 'Is he serious or is he screwing with me?' And he's serious. ... He's like, 'I've gotta put it on you more, I've gotta put it in front of you better.' ... I was sure that he was pissed off at me, but he was pissed off at himself."
It was the first time Stallworth ever experienced that with any quarterback, a QB who demanded the same level of perfection and accountability of himself as he did with others.
"At that moment, I realized that's why he's already a future Hall of Famer. Because of that right there," Stallworth said. "That's when I realized why this dude is who he is. He's a perfectionist. He wants perfection, but not just that -- he's a super competitor."
While Brady has been known for being tough on the field, he goes out of his way to convey how much he cares off of it. The night before away games, Brady finds a local restaurant to cater a meal for himself, his offensive linemen and tight ends. The conversations aren't about football; they talk about family and share funny stories from their pasts.
"There was an Italian meal ... he [knew] the best restaurant in every city we played in," Ohrnberger said. "There was this one place that served this huge family-style meal in one of the ballrooms at the hotel we were staying at. ... I gorged myself. I was so stuffed. The food was so delicious. I was like, 'I don't even know if this is necessarily a great thing a day before we play.' But I just couldn't help myself.
"Finding those opportunities to connect as people, as friends, as brothers -- those were important to Tom, and it certainly became important to all of us."
Running back Kevin Faulk tried to warn Stallworth prior to their first preseason game in 2007.
"He goes, 'Stay away from Brady before we walk out,'" Stallworth said, assuming it was to give Brady some quiet moments to himself. "And he goes, 'He's gonna head-butt the s--- out of you. He's too fired up. Stay away from him, man.'
"I had kinda forgotten about it until he walked up to me and I'm like, 'S---.' And he like head-butts the hell out of me," Stallworth said. "And I'm like, 'This dude is like serious.' I didn't know that he was as competitive as he was. When people talk about [Michael] Jordan being as competitive as he was, that's the same thing with Tom Brady."
At the end of warm-ups at games, Brady has a ritual of running down to the end of the field on the home side of the stadium. He yells to the fans, "Let's go! Let's go!" In the AFC Championship Game following the 2017 season, Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey, one of the biggest trash-talkers in the league and 17 years younger than Brady, began shouting at him.
"And Tom's giving it right back to him," said Stallworth, who watched the game on TV and recalled fond memories of him jawing with other players. "That's who Brady is. I love to trash-talk, so when a quarterback does it, I'm like in love. ... I've seen him get into it with Terrell Suggs and Ray Lewis -- yelling and cussing at them and they're yelling and cussing at him back. He loves that stuff."

    <h5 class="mb-1">EXCLUSIVE: A cannabis company is in talks to sponsor English Premier League side Everton FC, its CEO says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CORRECTION: This story previously said that Swissx is part-owned by Mike Tyson. A representative for Tyson denied the former boxer having any involvement in the company.
A cannabis company is in talks with English Premier League team Everton to sponsor its shirt, CEO Alki David told Insider this week.
Swissx, which was founded by and billionaire Alki David, is one of the world’s leading producers of cannabidiol (CBD) products.
Swissx had previously wanted to acquire the naming rights to FC Barcelona’s Camp Nou stadium, which are up for sale to raise money for coronavirus aide, however a deal was not reached.
Speaking with Insider, David, 51, said: “I’m not walking away from Barca, I’m keeping the door wide open. But we are now engaged with Everton to take over their shirt. The front of their shirt.
“They contacted me and have already offered designs with the whole Swissx logo in blue, which I’m not crazy about, but it will look nice.”
David added: “When I first came to England, everybody was supporting Man United and Liverpool, and everybody was red. Being contrary, I liked blue and I liked the logo so randomly I selected Everton to support. So it’s sort of a mystical come around.”
David has frequently discussed his links to former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, and SwissX has been referred to frequently in the media, including by the BBC, as being “Tyson’s company.” A representative for Tyson denied to Insider that the boxer is in any way affialited with Swissx.
Everton is currently sponsored by Sportpesa, however will have a new sponsor next season after agreeing to cut short its contract with the betting firm in February, according to The Telegraph.
Should Everton partner with Swissx, it would be the first club in Premier League history to have a cannabis-based product as its shirt sponsor.
Everton did not reply to Insider’s request for comment on the possible deal.
Earlier in the week, David told BBC Sport he was looking at acquiring the naming rights to the Camp Nou, because it is a “great stadium” and “seemed like an amazing idea.”
Barcelona denied that there had been any contact between itself and Swissx, however David insists otherwise, and says the Spanish club are being publicly cautious because of the nature of the company.
“They are just being d—-,” he said. “My door is open.
“The bottom line is they are being really precious about this being a cannabis brand. But they’ve got to realise that UFC embraces cannabis, and other major sporting leagues accept cannabis.
“My brand is not a f—ing marijuana brand, its a wellness CBD brand based on health, not based on recreation.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mike Tyson's cannabis company in talks to be sponsors for Premier League club</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mike Tyson’s business partner Alki David has claimed their cannabis company, Swissx, is in talks to sponsor Premier League team Everton.
Swissx CEO David and boxing legend Tyson have also been linked with buying the naming rights for Barcelona’s Camp Nou, but the producers of CBD products are also pushing to break into the Premier League market.
Everton are fielding offers for shirt sponsors and David revealed he received an approach from the Merseyside club.
‘I’m not walking away from Barca, I’m keeping the door wide open,’ David told Insider.
‘But we are now engaged with Everton to take over their shirt. The front of their shirt.
‘They contacted me and have already offered designs with the whole Swissx logo in blue, which I’m not crazy about, but it will look nice.’
‘When I first came to England, everybody was supporting Man United and Liverpool, and everybody was red,’ he continued.
‘Being contrary, I liked blue and I liked the logo so randomly I selected Everton to support. So it’s sort of a mystical come around.’
Barcelona recently denied they had received any offer from Swissx to acquire naming rights, while Everton is yet to respond to David’s comments.
Everton’s current sport sponsor are Kenyan bettingfirm SportPesa, but that partnership will end at the conclusion of this season.
With the coronavirus pandemic forcing football to go into shutdown, Everton will be grateful for the new sponsorship deal as clubs battle to deal with the financial effects of the lockdown.
Premier League chiefs are pushing ahead with plans to restart the 2019/20 season this summer and have selected eight ‘neutral’ venues where the remaining fixtures can be played.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lille receive £75m bid for Osimhen - The Nation Nigeria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An unnamed club has lodged a £75m bid for Lille striker and Liverpool and Man United target Victor Osimhen, according to reports.
Osimhen has attracted interest throughout Europe after scoring 18 goals in 38 appearances during his breakthrough season in France.
The 21-year-old sat joint-fourth in the Ligue Un goalscoring charts, level with Neymar, before the season was curtailed due to the global pandemic.
Osimhen had impressed enough to be named as a ‘priority’ target for Man United this summer, while Inter Milan are among the continental clubs keeping a watchful eye on developments.
Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham have all also been linked but are unlikely to have been behind the reported £75m bid Lille have received for the Nigerian.
French outlet Telefoot suggest an unnamed side has completely ignored the fact that literally no-one has any money by bidding for Osimhen’s services.
Liverpool are almost certain not to be the club in question after it emerged that they were planning for a second successive summer of no major signings due to the current financial situation.
The Reds had hoped to pursue Timo Werner and Houssem Aouar of Leipzig and Lyon respectively, but are now ‘budgeting for the loss of income’ and ‘now look virtually certain’ to spend nothing.
United can also perhaps be ruled out due to Ed Woodward’s recent comments concerning the transfer window.
Odion Ighalo believes his compatriot is “the future of Nigerian football” who “has that lion’s heart”.
“I talk to Osimhen, he’s a very nice boy, young, he’s a good guy,” Ighalo told Elegbete TV last month.
“We talk, not almost every day, but almost every time I advise him.
“He’s the future; he’s going to do so well in football. I always advise him to keep calm, keep working hard and the guy is going to be a celebrity, you know.
“I love him, I just want him to keep working hard the way he’s doing, he’s going to break so many records in Europe and Nigeria.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An unnamed club have reportedly tabled a bid to sign Lille striker Victor Osimhen, who has been linked with Liverpool and Manchester United.
Osimhen has attracted interest throughout Europe after scoring 18 goals in 38 appearances during his breakthrough season in France.
The 21-year-old sat joint-fourth in the Ligue Un goalscoring charts, level with Neymar, before the season was curtailed due to the global pandemic.
Osimhen had impressed enough to be named as a 'priority' target for Man Utd this summer, while Inter Milan are among the continental clubs keeping a watchful eye on developments.
Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham have all also been linked but are unlikely to have been behind the reported £75m bid Lille have received for the Nigerian.
French outlet Telefoot suggest an unnamed side has completely ignored the fact that literally no-one has any money by bidding for Osimhen's services.
Liverpool are almost certain not to be the club in question after it emerged that they were planning for a second successive summer of no major signings due to the current financial situation.
The Reds had hoped to pursue Timo Werner and Houssem Aouar of Leipzig and Lyon respectively, but are now 'budgeting for the loss of income' and 'now look virtually certain' to spend nothing.
United can also perhaps be ruled out due to Ed Woodward's recent comments concerning the transfer window.
Odion Ighalo believes his compatriot is "the future of Nigerian football" who "has that lion's heart".
"I talk to Osimhen, he's a very nice boy, young, he's a good guy," Ighalo told Elegbete TV last month.
"We talk, not almost every day, but almost every time I advise him.
"He's the future, he's going to do so well in football. I always advise him to keep calm, keep working hard and the guy is going to be a celebrity, you know.
"I love him, I just want him to keep working hard the way he's doing, he's going to break so many records in Europe and Nigeria."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Transfer News: Unnamed club lodge €85 million bid for Victor Osimhen amid interest from Manchester United, Chelsea</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to French outlet Telefoot, Lille have received a bid worth €85 million from an unnamed club for Victor Osimhen. The Nigerian striker is reportedly also being tailed by Manchester United and Chelsea over a move in the summer transfer window.
Osimhen joined Lille from RSC Charleroi last summer and made an instant impact at the Ligue 1 club. Now that the 2019-20 season has officially ended in France, and with Lille not in Europe, the 21-year-old’s final tally for the campaign reads a solid 18 goals and 6 assists in 38 appearances.
The player’s progress in his maiden season with Lille has not gone unnoticed. In fact, The Sun have reported that Manchester United and Chelsea are among the clubs that have been left impressed by Osimhen and have been plotting a summer move for him.
Manchester United have seen Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial take more responsibility this season and excelling in more influential roles. However, there is still a sense that Martial could do with some competition till Mason Greenwood is deemed ready to become a regular. If United don’t sign Odion Ighalo permanently, they will need to sign some other striker.
To that end, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is one of a number of strikers linked with a switch to Old Trafford. Osimhen is the latest to be added to that shortlist and is a viable target for United with his pacy style of play and the ability to play across the frontline. As for Chelsea, the Blues appear to be in the same boat as Manchester United.
Tammy Abraham has enjoyed a stellar 2019-20 campaign, but Chelsea have struggled when he has been unavailable. Michy Batshuayi continues to be unimpressive, while Olivier Giroud could leave in search of regular game time. Like Manchester United, Chelsea are also said to be in pursuit of Aubameyang, with Dries Mertens another fowards linked lately.
Apart from Manchester United and Chelsea, the likes of Tottenham and Inter Milan also have Osimhen in their sights, while Liverpool have even contacted Lille over the possibility of signing the 21-year-old, as per The Sun. Now, though, an unnamed club has put an €85 million bid on the table for Les Dogues, according to Telefoot.
Bear in mind, this unnamed club could be Manchester United, Chelsea or any of the suitors named already. If not, though, both United and Chelsea ought to pull their socks up in order to prise Osimhen away from Lille.
Chelsea would be hoping to make good on their strong relations with Lille in order to land Osimhen having also attempted to sign Gabriel Magalhaes from the Ligue 1 outfit. As for Manchester United, it remains to be seen if they are willing to take the required steps to sign the Nigerian striker.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United rival Premier League clubs for transfer of Paul Pogba replacement</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United have reportedly targeted Ajax star Donny van de Beek as a potential replacement for Paul Pogba.
According to the print edition of Sport, as translated by Sport Witness, there is a large amount of interest in the Netherlands international, with Man Utd looking to strengthen in midfield.
Pogba has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid by the Sun, so a summer move for midfielder Van de Beek makes sense as an ideal substitute in that position.
The 23-year-old reached the Champions League semi-final last season with Ajax. The team’s performances provoked an extensive amount of transfer rumours linking players away. A few players left the Johan Cruyff Arena at the end of last season – Matthijs de Ligt and Frenkie De Jong among others – but Van de Beek stayed.
This season, van de Beek racked up 14 goal contributions in 23 Eredivisie appearances. However, the coronavirus pandemic has prompted the Dutch FA to cancel the season, ultimately eliminating his team’s chances of winning the league.
Many transfer rumours from the 2018/19 season have remained. According to Sport, as translated by Sport Witness, Newcastle and Everton have reportedly shown interest in signing Ajax’s ace. However, this report claims that the Red Devils are transfer ‘favourites’ for the Netherlands international.
If this deal goes ahead, it will upgrade United’s team and provide healthy competition for the likes of Fred and Scott McTominay, and it would surely also be a boost to land this top talent ahead of other Premier League clubs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Victor Osimhen could be Newcastle United’s Didier Drogba if they are £75m mystery bidders</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lille forward Victor Osimhen is attracting plenty of interest with his form in France and, it seems, one club has, in fact, made a big-money move for the player. 
As reported by Telefoot, Lille have received an €85 million (£75m) bid for the player from an unnamed club. 
Several teams are reportedly interested in the player and Voetbal Belgie has suggested Newcastle United, along with others, as the apparent bidders. 
Indeed, as reported by Le10 Sport last month, Newcastle United are being credited with an interest in Osimhen. In fact, Newcastle’s interest dates farther back than that. 
In November, The Chronicle reported that Osimhen was on Newcastle United’s radar. His impressive form at Lille had the club scouting his progress but until now, it seemed his form had accelerated him above Newcastle’s paygrade. 
But with a Saudi-backed takeover around the corner, perhaps Newcastle could actually win the race for this long-term target. 
Osimhen has been compared to Didier Drogba in the past by his former Charleroi team-mate Nicolas Penneteau (La Voix Du Nord) and he could easily have a similar impact as the Ivorian did at Stamford Bridge if he headed to St James’ Park.
When becoming a mega-rich side, one thing needed quickly is a goalscorer to fire a team to glory. At Manchester City, they burned through the likes of Roque Santa Cruz, Craig Bellamy, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez, Edin Dzeko, and Mario Balotelli before Sergio Aguero fired them to glory.
At Chelsea, Hernan Crespo, Adrian Mutu, and Mateja Kezman were not the answer. But Drogba was. The recruit from Marseille soon became the club’s most dangerous frontman and fired Chelsea to glory. 
At Newcastle United, finding that goalscorer will likely prove as elusive a hunt. But if they are the team making early tracks to sign Osimhen, then the Nigerian nightmare might just be the striker they need to terrify Premier League defences.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 25-year-old ran down his contract at Paris Saint-Germain before joining Juve last summer, penning a four-year deal with the Italian champions.
Rabiot has made 24 appearances for Maurizio Sarri's side during the 2019-20 campaign but has only started 11 Serie A matches since arriving in Turin.
The Frenchman has been linked with a move away from the Italian champions ahead of this summer's transfer window, and according to Tuttomercatoweb, United are in the hunt for his signature.
The report claims that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have watched the midfielder on several occasions this season as they explore the possibility of a summer deal.
Rabiot could be viewed as a potential replacement for Paul Pogba, who could allegedly be allowed to leave the 20-time English champions for £60m ahead of the 2020-21 campaign.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United identify ideal Paul Pogba replacement and more transfer rumours</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United have identified Donny Van de Beek as the ideal signing to replace Paul Pogba if the Frenchman leaves Old Trafford, reports say.
Pogba is once again subject to speculation linking him with a move away from United this summer. He has spent most of the current campaign on the sidelines with injury.
Now, Spanish newspaper Sport suggest United are open to letting Pogba leave at the end of the season and have already identified Ajax midfielder Van de Beek as the ideal man to replace him.
Van de Beek impressed in Ajax's run to the 2018/19 Champions League semi-finals, before helping the Netherlands to the inaugural Nations League final last summer. With the Dutch season now cancelled and no title awarded, Van de Beek may be available with no more fixtures to play until next season. MEN Sport understands United like the player.
Meanwhile, Inter Milan forward Lautaro Martinez has decided he wants to move to Barcelona this summer, according to reports.
Mundo Deportivo suggest the Argentine has chosen to join Barcelona despite interest from United, City and Chelsea.
Finally, United will not force Jesse Lingard out of the club this year and could even trigger a one-year extension in his current deal, according to 90 min.
Lingard has had a frustrating time over the last 12 months, and has found himself on the fringes of the starting XI while other players have strengthened their places in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's thoughts.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Indian Olympic Association President Narinder Batra on Saturday said he will again request the government to allow national campers undergo outdoor training inside the country's major sports centres during the coronavirus-forced lockdown. Batra said the IOA had earlier requested the government in this regard but was not successful in eliciting a positive response. Some athletes at the NIS-Patiala had also written to the Sports Ministry to allow outdoor training by observing government's social distancing guidelines. "We have made some efforts trying to convince MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) to allow the athletes to train outdoors with all the social distancing guidelines.
The campers at the NIS, at Bengaluru SAI Centre and SAI Kolkata have not been able to have outdoor training," Batra said.
"I don't know whether they will be allowed in the next two weeks of lockdown. But I am once again trying on Sunday with the government," he said while addressing onine the Special General Body Meeting of Athletics Federation of India.
He also offered his good offices to intervene on any issue relating to the extension of tenure of the coaches and High Performance Directors of various National Sports Federations.
Batra even suggested the AFI to consider extending the contracts of the coaches till the 2022 Asian Games and Commonwealth Games.
"Please take a decision on the extension of contracts of High Performance Directors or coaches. Let me know if I can be of any help. I will intervene whenever required and try to sort out the issue (with sports ministry).
"I think in some sports the Asian Games or the Commonwealth Games are 2024 Olympics qualification events or will offer ranking points for qualification. So, federations can even think of that on the extension of contract of coaches," he added.
Batra lauded the AFI's efforts to raise the profile of the country's athletics. "Athletics always lead in India's impressive performances in the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games."

    <h5 class="mb-1">IOA chief Batra continues push for athletes' outdoor training during lockdown, to again request govt</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Indian Olympic Association President Narinder Batra on Saturday said he will again request the government to allow national campers undergo outdoor training inside the country's major sports centres during the coronavirus-forced lockdown.
Batra said the IOA had earlier requested the government in this regard but was not successful in eliciting a positive response. Some athletes at the NIS-Patiala had also written to the sports ministry to allow outdoor training by observing the government's social distancing guidelines.
"We have made some efforts trying to convince MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) to allow the athletes to train outdoors with all the social distancing guidelines. The campers at the NIS, at Bengaluru SAI Centre and SAI Kolkata have not been able to have outdoor training," Batra said.
"I don't know whether they will be allowed in the next two weeks of lockdown. But I am once again trying on Sunday with the government," he said while addressing online the Special General Body Meeting of the Athletics Federation of India.

He also offered his good offices to intervene on any issue relating to the extension of tenure of the coaches and High Performance Directors of various National Sports Federations.
Batra even suggested the AFI to consider extending the contracts of the coaches till the 2022 Asian Games and Commonwealth Games.
"Please take a decision on the extension of contracts of High Performance Directors or coaches. Let me know if I can be of any help. I will intervene whenever required and try to sort out the issue (with sports ministry).
"I think in some sports the Asian Games or the Commonwealth Games are 2024 Olympics qualification events or will offer ranking points for qualification. So, federations can even think of that on the extension of the contract of coaches," he added.
Batra lauded the AFI's efforts to raise the profile of the country's athletics.
"Athletics always lead in India's impressive performances in the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kevin de Bruyne might consider Man City future if club’s Uefa Champions League ban is upheld</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With his club handed a two-year ban from European football by Uefa heard by the Court of Arbitration before the start of next season’s Champions League, Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne admitted he would be forced to consider his future.
City’s has vowed to fight the sanction imposed by Uefa on February 14 for breaching financial fair play regulations.
“Once we know more, I will make a decision. Two years without playing in Europe would be long but in the case of one year I might see,” he said.
De Bruyne also said he was optimistic about City’s participation in next season’s Champions League. Uefa has banned the club from European competition for the next two years for “serious breaches” of financial fair-play rules.
“The club told us they’re going to appeal and that they’re almost certain to get their way. I’m waiting to see what happens, but I trust my club,” said de Bruyne.
The 28-year-old Belgium international believes the Premier League season will be finished despite the coronavirus pandemic “because the financial aspect is far too important”.
“My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks. The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give people something. I think this season will be finished,” de Bruyne told Belgian daily Het Laatste Nieuws.
“The financial aspect is far too important in the Premier League. If the season is not finished, it will cause serious problems,” he added.
Clubs were presented with the league’s “Project Restart” plans at a meeting on Friday and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-2020 season must be played at neutral venues.

    <h5 class="mb-1">De Bruyne warns he could leave Man City if ban is upheld</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin de Bruyne has admitted he may have to consider his future at Manchester City if the club's two-year Champions League ban is upheld.
City were suspended from European competition for the next two seasons by UEFA in February for "serious breaches" of Financial Fair Play rules, a ruling they are taking to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
The Belgium midfielder, 28, said he would have to consider leaving if the ban was upheld. The admission is likely to put a host of Europe's top clubs on alert, including Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus.
"I'm just waiting a little bit," de Bruyne told the Het Laatse Nieuws and VTM television in Belgium. "The club has told us that they will appeal. And they are 100 per cent convinced that they are in the right. I have confidence in my club. If they are saying it's true, then I believe them.
"We'll wait and see what happens. Once there's a final decision I will look at it. Two years [without Champions League football] would be long. One year is something I might be able to cope with."
Pep Guardiola, the City manager, has vowed to see out his contract with the club, which expires in June next year, even if they lose their appeal. But de Bruyne said his own future was not linked to what Guardiola might do.
"I think Pep has said that he'll stay until the end of next year whatever happens next," de Bruyne said. "I think his contract is running out then. We'll have to wait. But I'm not going to make a decision based on what he does, of course. I have already worked under other managers."
De Bruyne has three years left on his contract, which expires in June 2023 and is worth around £350,000(around $A680,000) a week including bonuses. He said there had been no formal discussions about an extension.
"I don't know what will happen. We are a bit in limbo with all what's happening now in the world," he said. "I still have three years left. When the season is finally finished, there might come an opportunity to look at the future. It's not the moment to think about it right now."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kevin De Bruyne admits European ban could force him to leave Manchester City</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin De Bruyne has admitted he will consider his future if Manchester City’s two-year ban from European competition stands, but suggested he could stay at the Etihad Stadium even if he faced a year out of the Champions League.
City were hit with the ban for “serious breaches” of Uefa’s Financial Fair Play regulations but have appealed against the punishment to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
There has been much speculation over the future of key players such as De Bruyne if the ban stands, but the Belgium international said he trusted the club as they insist they have done nothing wrong and can get the ban overturned.
“I’m just waiting,” De Bruyne said in an interview with Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws. “The club told us they are going to appeal and they are almost 100 hundred per cent sure they are right. That’s why I’m waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team.
“Once the decision is made, I will review everything. Two years would be long, but in the case of one year I might see.”
Remove a European ban from the equation, and De Bruyne said he had no reason to want to leave Manchester, even if the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona came knocking.
“I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England — for my competitive view the best competition — and I like that,” the 28-year-old said. “It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too.”
De Bruyne has three years remaining on his current City contract but manager Pep Guardiola will be entering the final year of his own deal next season. But De Bruyne said his future did not depend on the Catalan’s.
“I think Pep said he will take his year anyway no matter what. Then his contract ends,” he said. “But I’m not going to let my decision depend on what Pep is doing.
“Of course I have already worked with other trainers and when Pep leaves, I have to continue working with someone else. But I haven’t really paid much attention to that for the time being. There are more important things at the moment.”
The Premier League has been suspended for six weeks due to the coronavirus, but De Bruyne said he was sure the season would be finished.
“My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks,” he said. “The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give people something. Everything will be finished without fans I think. That is not really interesting for anyone, but this season will be finished.
“The financial aspect is far too important in the Premier League. If the season is not finished, it will cause serious problems.”
Asked about comments from his City team-mate Sergio Aguero, who said some players were scared to return due to the threat of the virus, De Bruyne said: “I don’t think people are really afraid for themselves, but for their family. That is mainly the problem for many people.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kevin De Bruyne would consider Man City future if two-year European ban upheld</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin De Bruyne has admitted he will consider his future if Manchester City’s two-year ban from European competition stands, but suggested he could stay at the Etihad Stadium even if he faced a year out of the Champions League.
City were hit with the ban for “serious breaches” of UEFA’s Financial Fair Play regulations but have appealed against the punishment to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
There has been much speculation over the future of key players such as De Bruyne if the ban stands, but the Belgium international said he trusted the club as they insist they have done nothing wrong and can get the ban overturned.
“I’m just waiting,” De Bruyne said in an interview with Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws. “The club told us they are going to appeal and they are almost 100 hundred per cent sure they are right. That’s why I’m waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team.
“Once the decision is made, I will review everything. Two years would be long, but in the case of one year I might see.”
Remove a European ban from the equation, and De Bruyne said he had no reason to want to leave Manchester, even if the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona came knocking.
“I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England – for my competitive view the best competition – and I like that,” the 28-year-old said.
“It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too.”
De Bruyne has three years remaining on his current City contract but manager Pep Guardiola will be entering the final year of his own deal next season.
But De Bruyne said his future did not depend on the Catalan’s.
“I think Pep said he will take his year anyway no matter what. Then his contract ends,” he said. “But I’m not going to let my decision depend on what Pep is doing.
“Of course I have already worked with other trainers and when Pep leaves, I have to continue working with someone else. But I haven’t really paid much attention to that for the time being. There are more important things at the moment.”
The Premier League has been suspended for six weeks due to the coronavirus, but De Bruyne said he was sure the season would be finished.
“My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks,” he said. “The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give people something. Everything will be finished without fans I think. That is not really interesting for anyone, but this season will be finished.
“The financial aspect is far too important in the Premier League. If the season is not finished, it will cause serious problems.”
Asked about comments from his City team-mate Sergio Aguero, who said some players were scared to return due to the threat of the virus, De Bruyne said: “I don’t think people are really afraid for themselves, but for their family. That is mainly the problem for many people.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kevin de Bruyne hints at Man City stay even if club are banned from Champions League</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin de Bruyne says he would consider staying at Manchester City for a season even if their ban from UEFA competition is upheld.
City were given a two-year ban by UEFA in February for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations, and immediately announced their intention to appeal the ruling. They have since submitted that appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and have always maintained confidence that the decision will be overturned on an independent investigation.
However, the possibility of having no Champions League football could see the club's best players look to leave in order to play in Europe's premier club competition.
De Bruyne has ambitions of winning the Champions League, and fans have been concerned that he could seek a move away from the club this summer if they are not eligible to play in the competition.
Speaking to HLN, De Bruyne said that a two-year absence from Europe could see him look to leave, but that a one year break could be manageable.
"I'm just waiting. The club has told us that they are going to appeal and that they is almost one hundred percent sure that they are right. That's why I'm waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team," he said.
"Once the statement is made, I will review everything. Two years would be long, in the case of one year I might see."
When pressed on whether De Bruyne would look to join a club like Real Madrid or Barcelona, he reaffirmed his happiness at City.
“In recent years, and before then too, there have been many teams who have polled and may have asked what I like. But to be honest, I'm very happy with City," he continued.
"I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England - for my competitive view the best competition - and I like that. It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too. What is coming is coming. But it's not that I've tried to leave City in those five years. I have also remained calm for my previous transfers. I have never had any problems and have always waited for my moment. With respect, because I think you get most of it back. Even outside of football. ”
The news will be welcome to City fans, and De Bruyne also confirmed that his future at the Etihad will not depend on whether manager Pep Guardiola stays at the club past his current deal that runs until 2021.
"I think Pep said he will take his year anyway no matter what. Then his contract ends. But I'm not going to let my decision depend on what Pep is doing. Of course I have already worked with other trainers and when Pep leaves, I have to continue working with someone else. But I haven't really paid much attention to that for the time being. There are more important things at the moment."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ultra-triathlete puts the pedal to the metal for good cause</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Confined to his tiny living room, ultra-triathlete Pascal Pich is still going a long way for a good cause.
The 56-year-old Frenchman is a five-time world champion of ultra-triathlon in which athletes may swim 3.8km, cycle 180km and finish by running a marathon.
While in confinement because of the coronavirus pandemic, he has covered 8,000km on a stationary bike on rollers.
His aim, as he pedals like a madman, is to raise money to make the lives of health workers easier.
His programme has included a return to an old favourite, the Tour de France. He once rode the Tour route in eight days and eight nights.
This time he started out by covering the equivalent of the 21 stages in 14 days without moving from his home in Savignargues, 30km from Nimes, in the south of France.
“The mileage is quite monstrous, but it’s nothing exceptional. What’s exceptional is doing it all alone and locked up,” Pich said.
“The idea is just to pedal.”
He goes “live” on social media every day and one of his sponsors has agreed to contribute money in return for “likes”.
They are using the funds to buy equipment, such as coffee machines, microwaves and table-tennis tables for health-care workers.
“One hundred machines have been delivered to the medical staff in 28 different hospitals,” said Pich.
At the start of the official lockdown in France, Pich looked for ways to help those on the front line in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Everyone does what they want to do and I want to pedal, so I pedal,” he said.
“I don’t care what other people think! It’s just as stupid to be sitting in your living room in front of the TV knocking back beers.”
After riding the 3,471km of the 21-stage Tour without leaving home, he allowed himself a short week of recovery. Then he climbed back on his stationary bike for 54 hours of racing over six days, the equivalent of a week’s work for the doctors.
Most recently, starting on April 24, he began working what he called 3x8 shifts to mirror the medical teams.
“That means eight hours of pedalling, eight hours of recovery,” Pich added.
He was aiming for 88 hours of cycling in seven days, covering between 250km and 320km in each eight-hour session.
In total, he will have travelled 8,000 km, alone in his small living room with his only view of the outside world the balcony where he hangs his sports clothes to dry.
“I’m all alone in the apartment. It’s really hard to deal with because I’m locked in a room that’s about 14 square metres. There is very little air,” said Pich, whose world records include distance covered in six days on a stationary bike (3,165 km), which he set in May 2018.
He is surrounded by electronic displays: a huge timer, like those used at major athletics events, a laptop and a TV screen on which he can watch movies.
“I hope for everyone that this will be the last challenge,” he said.
“Because I’m starting to get a bit burnt out, because it will mean we’ve made some progress with this virus. And that the medical staff are a little more relaxed.” – AFP

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">United States Women’s co-captain Megan Rapinoe has vowed she will never give up the fight for equality after a federal judge threw out their claim for equal pay with their male counterparts.
The 34-year-old, who won the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball at the 2019 Women’s World Cup, has been a leading voice in the fight against US Soccer, which suffered a big blow on Friday.
Judge Gary Klausner ruled the pay case did not warrant a trial, though the players’ case for unfair treatment in travel, housing and medical support will go to trial in June.
Rapinoe, a two-time World Cup winner, tweeted: “We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY.”
The United States National Women’s Team’s (USNWT) spokesperson Molly Levinson said the team were “shocked” and that they would appeal against the decision.
“We are shocked and disappointed with today’s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay,” she said on Twitter.
“We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.
“We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them.
“We will appeal and press on. Words cannot express our gratitude to all who support us.”

All games for the under-23 competitions and below have been terminated for the rest of the season, with a means of determining final standings still to be announced.
But the 22-year-old Rashford, who has come through the ranks at United, sent a message to academy players telling them to be “creative” as they try to keep improving despite the shutdown.
“The news you got yesterday was probably not what you wanted to hear,” Rashford wrote on Twitter. “I know all you want to do is play because I’m the same but the decision has been made to protect everyone involved. This is bigger than football.
“You might be feeling a bit low but the best thing you can do is pick up your ball and get out in the garden.
“When I was in the academy I used to find a spot in the garden and aim for targets just so I could practice my accuracy, get creative!
“Now is not the time to fall out of love with the game, it’s a time to remember why you fell in love with it in the first place. You’ve got this and we can’t wait to see you all back next season.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marcus Rashford sends message to Man Utd youngsters as season is cancelled</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rashford has told Manchester United's youngsters to keep their spirits up after the academy football season was cancelled.
The Premier League confirmed on Friday that all youth football seasons from under-23 level down to under-9 level had been curtailed, with United's under-23s sitting second in the second tier of Premier League 2.
"Premier League Shareholders today unanimously agreed to curtail the 2019/20 Academy Games Programme," said the league in a statement.
"This decision, which is independent of any discussions regarding the resumption of the 2019/20 campaign for first-team football, has been taken to give Academy staff and their players an element of clarity at this challenging time.
"The curtailment will include all Under-9 to Under-16 games as well as the Under-18 and Under-23 competitions.
Rashford responded to the news in a tweet on Saturday, when he urged the club's youngsters not to fall out of love with football.
"The news you got yesterday was probably not what you wanted to hear," he wrote.
"I know all you want to do is play because I'm the same but the decision has been made to protect everyone involved. This is bigger than football.
"You might be feeling a bit low but the best thing you can do is pick up your ball and get out in the garden.
"When I was in the academy I used to find a spot in the garden and aim for targets just so I could practice my accuracy, get creative!
"Now is not the time to fall out of love with the game, it's a time to remember why you fell in love with it in the first place. You've got this and we can't wait to see you all back next season."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marcus Rashford sends message to Man Utd youngsters as season is cancelled</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rashford has told Manchester United's youngsters to keep their spirits up after the academy football season was cancelled.
The Premier League confirmed on Friday that all youth football seasons from under-23 level down to under-9 level had been curtailed, with United's under-23s sitting second in the second tier of Premier League 2.
"Premier League Shareholders today unanimously agreed to curtail the 2019/20 Academy Games Programme," said the league in a statement.
"This decision, which is independent of any discussions regarding the resumption of the 2019/20 campaign for first-team football, has been taken to give Academy staff and their players an element of clarity at this challenging time.
"The curtailment will include all Under-9 to Under-16 games as well as the Under-18 and Under-23 competitions.
Rashford responded to the news in a tweet on Saturday, when he urged the club's youngsters not to fall out of love with football.
"The news you got yesterday was probably not what you wanted to hear," he wrote.
"I know all you want to do is play because I'm the same but the decision has been made to protect everyone involved. This is bigger than football.
"You might be feeling a bit low but the best thing you can do is pick up your ball and get out in the garden.
"When I was in the academy I used to find a spot in the garden and aim for targets just so I could practice my accuracy, get creative!
"Now is not the time to fall out of love with the game, it's a time to remember why you fell in love with it in the first place. You've got this and we can't wait to see you all back next season."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marcus Rashford sends classy message to Manchester United youngsters after academy season cancelled</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rashford has sent a message to Manchester United youngsters after the news that the academy season has been cancelled, urging them to remember why they fell in love with football.
The Premier League confirmed that all academy football up to under-23 level has been curtailed due to the coronavirus crisis to give clubs and players clarity at this uncertain time. United's under-23's were second in the Premier League 2 Division 2 before the season was cancelled, three points behind leaders West Ham with a game in hand.
The league will now decide how the final standings of the league will be decided, leaving United waiting to discover if they will be promoted to the top flight of youth football. The decision does not apply to the FA Youth Cup.
In response to the news, Rashford took to Twitter to share a message to young players at United affected by the news, saying the decision was made to protect them and offering advice on how to keep their spirits up.
He wrote: "The news you got yesterday was probably not what you wanted to hear. I know all you want to do is play because I'm the same, but the decision has been made to protect everyone involved. This is bigger than football.
"You might be feeling a bit low but the best thing you can do is pick up your ball and get out in the garden. When I was in the academy I used to find spot in the garden and aim for targets just so I could practice my accuracy, get creative!
"Now is not the time to fall out of love with the game, it's a time to remember why you fell in love with it in the first place.
"You've got this and we can't wait to see you all back next season!"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Back garden athletics: top vaulters set for 'ultimate clash'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paris: Three of the world's top male pole vaulters will meet in competition on Sunday in what has been dubbed the "Ultimate Garden Clash", with world sports decimated by the coronavirus pandemic.
World record-holder Mondo Duplantis of Sweden, two-time world champion Sam Kendricks of the United States and 2012 Olympic champion Renaud Lavillenie of France will be connected via a live video link as they compete from their own back gardens.
The event, which will be streamed by World Athletics, is scheduled to start at 1500 GMT and will span three locations: Lavillenie will vault from his home in Clermont-Ferrand, Kendricks will compete from his back garden in Oxford, Mississippi, and Duplantis will take part from his base in Lafayette, Louisiana.
The three vaulters will attempt to vault 5.00m as many times as possible in 30 minutes, a format the trio drew up in the face of a lack of officials.
"I'm ecstatic to be able to compete again, especially against Sam and Renaud," said Duplantis.
"Since it's unknown what other competitions we will all have together, we definitely are going to enjoy this and have a good time with it. Also, winning this is crucial because I don't like losing to them very much."
Lavillenie added: "This is a superb opportunity to see the best jumpers in a new competition format showing their love for their sport with a competition when most other sports are off."
Kendricks said it would be a question of "learning as we go".
"No matter how precise and accurate we are, I think the challenge is we don't know what it will take to win, so it will be hard to gauge our effort."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Athletics resumes with one-off international pole vault clash in stars' gardens</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Athletics will get around lockdown restrictions tomorrow by staging an international competition - in back gardens almost 5,000 miles apart.
Dubbed the Ultimate Garden Challenge, pole vault world record holder Mondo Duplantis will take on two-time world champion Sam Kendricks and 2012 Olympic champion Renaud Lavillenie live across social media.
Each has facilities at home, with Sweden's Duplantis and American Kendricks based 250 miles apart in the USA and Frenchman Lavillenie in Clermont-Ferrand.
The event will see each man attempt to clear five metres as many times as possible in 30 minutes - as it is not possible to have officials on hand to regulate a standard competition.
"We definitely are going to enjoy this," said Duplantis, who cleared a world record 6.18m in Glasgow in February. "Also, winning is crucial because I don't like losing to them very much.”
Athletics has lost its summer to the pandemic with at least the first half of the Diamond League season postponed along with all championships.
British pole vault queen Holly Bradshaw expressed delight that her discipline had come up with an innovative solution.
“It’s a really cool idea,” she said. “I only wish I could fit a pole vault pit in my 4m v 5m back garden!
“I’ll definitely be watching and I’ll be interested to see if it works and gets a good reception as something new and exciting could really put the spotlight on athletics.”
Meanwhile Katarina Johnson-Thompson has indicated she will not defend her world indoor pentathlon title in China next March as the rescheduled event clashes with the Europeans in Poland.
“When all of this got announced, the hope was the Olympics would be switched to the spring,” she said. “Then you could do the world indoors and just stay out there.
“Then they moved it to exactly a year after. With the Europeans now two weeks before the world indoors, I’m not sure it would make sense for me to do that as I cannot do the pentathlon in both.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus lockdown has been a mental battle, says Liverpool’s Dejan Lovren</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Staying focused on the Premier League title race during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown has been a mental battle despite all individual efforts to maintain physical fitness, Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren has said.
“It hasn't been easy as we have been locked up in our homes for 46 days now,” the Croatia international told Saturday's online edition of Sportske Novisti, the Balkan nation's leading sports daily.
“The psychological aspect is the most difficult to overome. I work out on my own as much as I can, I kick the ball around a bit with my son on our lawn, but training with the team is totally different,” he said.
The league, which has been suspended since March 9, remains in limbo and unable to take any steps until any government decision next week on possible changes to lockdown restrictions.
All 20 clubs held a conference call on Friday in which they looked at plans for a resumption of training later in May followed by a possible return to competitive action in June.
During the meeting, the clubs were informed that an eventual resumption of matches would only see them play only at neutral venues approved from a health and safety point of view.
Liverpool, who are on the verge of sealing their first league title since 1990, are top of the table on 82 points from 29 games, 25 ahead of second-placed champions Manchester City who have a game in hand.
Lovren acknowledged it was difficult to get excited by the daily routine under the circumstances.
“I try to stay motivated any way I can. I get up in the morning and tell myself 'I am going to get knackered in training today' and at least I've managed to lose some weight,” he said. “But I've also lost some mass on my legs because there is no substitute for a 90-minute team training session. You can't do an indoor exercise on your legs for 90 minutes.”
The 30-year old Bosnian-born centre back also expressed hope the season would resume in a timely manner so as to not disrupt the calendar more than the coronavirus pandemic already has.
“I hope (UEFA President) Aleksander Ceferin and all the other people from UEFA and FIFA will come up with a solution so that we don't get into a situation of having to play 15 games in 30 days,” he said.
“We need time off. This hasn't really been time off because the players will need to recover mentally from the pandemic and the resultant quarantine,” he added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sports minister Kiren Rijuju on Sunday said that boxing will play a huge role in helping India break into the Top-10 nation in medal tally at the Tokyo Olympics, which has been postponed to 2021 during the coronavirus pandemic that has brought the world to a halt.

Rijuju said this during an online video interactive session with India’s elite boxers of the country, likely to represent the nation at the Olympics, next year at Tokyo. Also Read - Tokyo Olympics Will Be Cancelled if Coronavirus Isn't Contained by 2021: Games Chief
Rijiju also informed that the government is planning to allow elite athletes to resume their training at the earliest in order to keep them ready for future competitions. Also Read - Ultimate Goal is to Have Kabaddi Included in Olympics: Kiren Rijiju
“I have discussions with my officers. We are planning out a way to start functioning as soon as possible. I thought, first of all, we should allow practice for the players who have qualified for the Olympics and who will be participating in the qualifiers or important championships. We can’t open all the coaching centres, so we will allow only for elite athletes. Junior camps have to wait for some time as safety will be priority,” he concluded.
Indian boxers have already secured a record nine qualification quotas at Tokyo Olympics and will be fighting for four more places in the upcoming qualification tournaments.
He further interacted with the boxers to know their situation during the lockdown and training schedules said Asian Games gold medallist Vikas Krishnan.
“Whatever we have achieved today, credit goes to the coaches, federation and the government. It”s really impressive and motivating to interact with you sir (Rijiju). If we keep getting support from the government, we will definitely win Olympic medals, World Championship medals,” Krishnan said.
A couple of days back, Rijuju interacted with elite kabaddi players and coaches via video conference and said that he would look to push the sport in the Olympics in the future.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India to step up battle for 2032 Olympics after pandemic: sports chief</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India will step up its battle to win the 2032 Olympic Games and other international events when the global coronavirus pandemic eases, its top sports leader Narinder Batra told AFP.
Ten years after hosting the Commonwealth Games, the Indian Olympic Association president said his country had lessons to learn but would not be deterred.
“We are serious and definitely pitching for the 2026 Youth Olympic Games and the 2032 Olympics,” he said on Friday.
India has already written expressions of interest to the International Olympic Committee but faces reported competition from Thailand, Russia and Colombia for the 2026 event.
Queensland in Australia, Shanghai and a potential joint bid between Seoul and Pyongyang are also being touted for the 2032 Olympics.
However, the pandemic has halted all debate. Batra, also head of the International Hockey Federation, said “documentation” has started for 2032 but work is now frozen. A final decision may take until 2025.
“Now there is a team that visits the various venues and you keep talking to them and then they submit a report. It is a continuous process which I believe will see no activity until December,” India's most influential sports leader said.
“This is not the time to talk with business houses or government about pitching for the Olympics. The first thing should be how we sort out this problem which has come into the world,” Batra added, referring to the virus.
Delhi's hosting of the Commonwealth Games was marked by construction delays, failing infrastructure and accusations of financial mismanagement.
More recently, Delhi was stripped of the 2021 world boxing championships, with the global body accusing organisers of failing to pay a hosting fee on time.
Batra said he knew nothing of the boxing dispute but insisted that the 2010 multi-sport event had made India think big and its growing economic clout means it has resources.
“I can say the biggest takeaway was that India is capable of hosting all big-ticket events whether it is Olympics or any other Games,” said Batra.
But he added that New Delhi did not capitalise enough on the 2010 Games by encouraging more young athletes.
“The Delhi event fell short on legacy values. The legacy that you produce more athletes and you develop them never happened here and that is why tournaments shifted out of Delhi,” he said.
“The fact that such a big event happened here was not properly exploited.”
India has a population of 1.3 billion people but while it excels at cricket, its team returned from the 2016 Rio Olympics with just two medals.
The coronavirus pandemic has only made it harder for athletes to train for the postponed Tokyo Olympics, put back until at least 2021.
But Batra is sticking to his prediction that India will get more than 10 medals whenever the next Games are held.
“About 80 Indian athletes have already qualified for the Olympics and are being monitored by directors and chief coaches,” he said.
“So I maintain my earlier prediction of a double-figure medal tally and I don't think this situation will change anything.”
Batra said he was counting on the men's hockey team — which has won eight Olympic golds but not finished in the first four since 1980 — to return to success.
“In this Olympics I am certainly looking to the men's team for a medal,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India to Bid For 2032 Olympics Hosting Rights: IOA President Narinder Batra</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">President of the Indian Olympic Association Narinder Batra has confirmed that India will bid for acquiring the hosting rights of the 2032 Olympics. Having hosted the Commonwealth Games which was a commercial success, it was one marred with controversy, and although India is yet to host a major world event since, Batra said India will try and bag the biggest sporting event in the world, having taken the 2010 CWG learnings into consideration.

“We are serious and definitely pitching for the 2026 Youth Olympic Games and the 2032 Olympics,” Batra told AFP Friday. Also Read - No Foreign Training For Indian Athletes Till End Of This Year
However, before India throw their name in the hat, Batra said the COVID-19 pandemic needs to come under control. Batra informed the documentation process for 2032 Olympics has begun but is currently frozen due to the global pandemic. India have written to the Indian Olympics Association expressing their interest in hosting the events, but are reportedly facing competition from Thailand, Russia and Colombia for the Youth Games.

“Now there is a team that visits the various venues and you keep talking to them and then they submit a report. It is a continuous process which I believe will see no activity until December,” Batra said. “This is not the time to talk with business houses or government about pitching for the Olympics. The first thing should be how we sort out this problem which has come into the world.”
India recently lost the hosting rights for the 2021 World Boxing Championships for not providing visa to shooters from Pakistan for the 2020 World Cup due to political tensions between two countries. And while India ran the risk of losing out future events because of this, Batra feels quite the opposite.
“I can say the biggest takeaway was that India is capable of hosting all big-ticket events whether it is Olympics or any other Games,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India to step up battle for 2032 Olympics after pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DEHLI
India will step up its battle to win the 2032 Olympic Games and other international events when the global coronavirus pandemic eases, its top sports leader Narinder Batra told AFP.
Ten years after hosting the Commonwealth Games, the Indian Olympic Association president said his country had lessons to learn but would not be deterred.
"We are serious and definitely pitching for the 2026 Youth Olympic Games and the 2032 Olympics," he said Friday.
India has already written expressions of interest to the International Olympic Committee but faces reported competition from Thailand, Russia and Colombia for the 2026 event.
Queensland in Australia, Shanghai and a potential joint bid between Seoul and Pyongyang are also being touted for the 2032 Olympics.
However, the pandemic has halted all debate. Batra, also head of the International Hockey Federation, said "documentation" has started for 2032 but work is now frozen. A final decision may take until 2025.
"Now there is a team that visits the various venues and you keep talking to them and then they submit a report. It is a continuous process which I believe will see no activity until December," India's most influential sports leader said.
"This is not the time to talk with business houses or government about pitching for the Olympics. The first thing should be how we sort out this problem which has come into the world," Batra added, referring to the virus.
Delhi's hosting of the Commonwealth Games was marked by construction delays, failing infrastructure and accusations of financial mismanagement.
More recently, Delhi was stripped of the 2021 world boxing championships, with the global body accusing organisers of failing to pay a hosting fee on time.
Batra said he knew nothing of the boxing dispute but insisted that the 2010 multi-sport event had made India think big and its growing economic clout means it has resources.
"I can say the biggest takeaway was that India is capable of hosting all big-ticket events whether it is Olympics or any other Games," said Batra.
But he added that New Delhi did not capitalise enough on the 2010 Games by encouraging more young athletes.
"The Delhi event fell short on legacy values. The legacy that you produce more athletes and you develop them never happened here and that is why tournaments shifted out of Delhi," he said.
"The fact that such a big event happened here was not properly exploited."
India has a population of 1.3 billion people but while it excels at cricket, its team returned from the 2016 Rio Olympics with just two medals.
The coronavirus pandemic has only made it harder for athletes to train for the postponed Tokyo Olympics, put back until at least 2021.
But Batra is sticking to his prediction that India will get more than 10 medals whenever the next Games are held.
"About 80 Indian athletes have already qualified for the Olympics and are being monitored by directors and chief coaches," he said.
"So I maintain my earlier prediction of a double-figure medal tally and I don't think this situation will change anything."
Batra said he was counting on the men's hockey team - which has won eight Olympic golds but not finished in the first four since 1980 - to return to success.
"In this Olympics I am certainly looking to the men's team for a medal," he said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">other sports
Written By Press Trust Of India | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 07:45 IST
IOC member and IOA president Narinder Batra on Saturday said that the postponed 2020 Tokyo Olympics will "definitely" be held next year, amid concerns over staging the mega event before a COVID-19 vaccine is found. Some eminent scientists and doctors have expressed doubts on the holding of the Tokyo Olympics if a vaccine is not found by then. Even the Japan Medical Association president said it would only be possible for the Olympics to go ahead in July 2021 if the infections were under control, not only in Japan, but globally. International Olympic Committee's (IOC) coordination commission for the Tokyo Olympics, John Coates of Australia had, however, disagreed with suggestions that a vaccine for COVID-19 is needed to hold the Games.
Batra was elected as president of International Hockey Federation (FIH) in November 2016 and became an IOC member in June last year. He has been at the helm of IOA since December 2017. He said his tenure as FIH chief has been extended till June next year as the elections scheduled to be held in October this year has been postponed to June next year in view of the unprecedented situation arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Batra also said some 140-odd National Olympic Committees were to hold their elections within two-three months of the original (2020) date of Tokyo Olympics and they have been allowed by the IOC to hold the polls next year.

Even the Japan Medical Association president said it would only be possible for the Olympics to go ahead in July 2021 if the infections were under control, not only in Japan, but globally.
International Olympic Committee's (IOC) coordination commission for the Tokyo Olympics, John Coates of Australia had, however, disagreed with suggestions that a vaccine for COVID-19 is needed to hold the Games.

While addressing the Special General Body Meeting of the Athletics Federation of India, which was held online, Indian Olympic Association (IOA) chief Batra said, "Don't go by what is being said that Olympics may not be held next year. Tokyo Olympics will definitely be held next year.
"I am keeping in touch with reliable sources, interacting with important fora in the world of sport. So, Olympics are happening next year.
"I believe there will be some treatment (of coronavirus) by September or October this year. We (India) have to plan ourselves thinking that Olympics will be held."
Batra was elected as president of International Hockey Federation (FIH) in November 2016 and became an IOC member in June last year. He has been at the helm of IOA since December 2017.
He said his tenure as FIH chief has been extended till June next year as the elections scheduled to be held in October this year has been postponed to June next year in view of the unprecedented situation arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Batra also said some 140-odd National Olympic Committees were to hold their elections within two-three months of the original (2020) date of Tokyo Olympics and they have been allowed by the IOC to hold the polls next year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus US sport shutdown will cost $12 billion: report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York: The $100 billion US sports landscape will lose $12 billion in revenue due to the coronavirus shutdown, ESPN reported Friday, with deeper cuts if NFL and college gridiron games are wiped out.
Analysis of the magnitude of business losses includes superstar salaries to pay for stadium workers but it might be a conservative estimate because it does not include outdoor recreational sport, gambling or such individual sports as golf, tennis and NASCAR, the most popular form of US auto racing.
Patrick Rishe, sports business program director at Washington University in St. Louis, estimated the impact of the shutdown on major US pro and college sports leagues as well as youth sport for ESPN, which also had labor market analysis firm Emsi make sport-related job estimates.
Rishe estimated US pro sports would lose $5.5 billion from the shutdown while college sports would lose $3.9 billion and youth sport tourism would fall by $2.4 billion.
And those figures assume Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer can finish half of their scheduled seasons with spectators while the NBA and the National Hockey League cancel the unfinished part of their regular seasons and stage playoff games without spectators with youth sports resuming in July.
None of that is assured given the stay-at-home orders remaining in place over most of the nation as a result of the deadly virus that has killed more than 63,000 people in the United States and infected more than one million.
"As an economist, you stand back, you look at the carnage that's taking place - dumbfounded, awestruck, mind-numbing. All of those phrases, they're all relevant becaus we just have never seen anything on this scale," Rishe told ESPN.
Figures include $3.25 billion that would have been spent by spectators on pro sports plus $371 million of income for stadium and arena workers and $2.2 billion in US television rights fees.
An NFL wipe out would cost more than $11.5 billion in television revenue while 65 major collegiate American football programs receive about $4 billion in TV money, about half the income that finances all athletic department budgets.
There are three million jobs nationwide that depend upon sports, from ushers and guards to scouts and trainers, according to the report.
Rishe said that should MLB play without spectators for half a season for its 162-games-a-team schedule, over $2 billion more in game-day fan spending would be lost.

Welcome to what the world of tennis could look like once government restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic have been lifted. 
On Friday, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), issued a set of guidelines for local and national-level competitions.
"They emphasize that decisions made by governments take precedence and that tennis (either competitive or recreational) should not be played until governments have sufficiently relaxed any restrictions that are currently in place," said an ITF statement.
The guidelines include arriving at a venue already dressed and leaving immediately after the conclusion of a match.
"Do not use the locker rooms or showers," say the ITF.
Masks are to be worn while off-court, players and officials should maintain at least two meters between each other while handshakes are also off-limits.
Each player is asked to use their own set of balls - separately numbered. 
Ball boys and girls to wear rubber gloves while at changeovers, players must go around opposite sides of the net.
Players are also discouraged from signing autographs and from taking selfies while being warned not share equipment, water bottles or food.
Tournaments should also only be singles and played without spectators.
"While following measures such as these will ensure that the risk from COVID-19 is minimized, the guidelines are clear that the risk cannot be eliminated altogether," added the ITF.
The professional ATP and WTA tours have been suspended since mid-March and are not expected to resume until July 13 at the earliest.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS: No shaking, no showering, no sharing, no signing.
Welcome to what the world of tennis could look like once government restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic have been lifted.
On Friday, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), issued a set of guidelines for local and national-level competitions.
“They emphasise that decisions made by governments take precedence and that tennis (either competitive or recreational) should not be played until governments have sufficiently relaxed any restrictions that are currently in place,” said an ITF statement.
The guidelines include arriving at a venue already dressed and leaving immediately after the conclusion of a match.
“Do not use the locker rooms or showers,” say the ITF.
Masks are to be worn while off-court, players and officials should maintain at least two metres between each other while hand shakes are also off limits.
Each player is asked to use their own set of balls – separately numbered.
Ball boys and girls to wear rubber gloves while at changeovers, players must go around opposite sides of the net.
Players are also discouraged from signing autographs and from taking selfies while being warned not share equipment, water bottles or food.
Tournaments should also only be singles and played without spectators.
“While following measures such as these will ensure that the risk from COVID-19 is minimised, the guidelines are clear that the risk cannot be eliminated altogether,” added the ITF.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sir Bill Beaumont re-elected as World Rugby chairman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir Bill Beaumont has fought off competition from Agustin Pichot to be re-elected as the World Rugby chairman for a second term.
Beaumont won a slim 28-23 majority in the vote ahead of his vice-chairman Pichot, who will be replaced by Frenchman Bernard Laporte.
The 68-year-old will stay at the head of the governing body for the next four years, having started the role in 2016, and his primary task will be to lead the sport’s response to the Covid-19 crisis.
He said: “Over the last four years we have achieved a lot, but we are at half-time and need to press on in the second half. I now have a clear mandate to work with Bernard to implement progressive, sustainable change.
“As an organisation, we must lead, be transparent, accountable and continue to serve for all. We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible.
“We must listen to players, fans, competitions, our unions and regions, and take decisions that are in the best interests of all with our strong values to the fore.
“Now is not the time for celebration. We have work to do. We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
Pichot, who had worked alongside Beaumont for the last four years, had promised a radical new approach had he won the election, but fell just short in his quest to usurp Beaumont.
Beaumont added: “I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we aligned in many ways, and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant.”
President of the French Rugby Federation Laporte was voted into his position unopposed.
He said: “Congratulations to my friend Sir Bill Beaumont on his re-election.
“I would also like to express my best wishes to Agustin Pichot, a legend of Argentinian rugby and a great rugby leader.
“I also want to thank all unions who have expressed their opinion in this important ballot, giving a clear mandate for the governance which Bill and I will undertake on their behalf.”
Beaumont’s new four-year term will officially begin on May 12 when the results of the vote will be confirmed at World Rugby’s annual meeting of council.

Beaumont, 68, beat off the challenge of his his vice-chairman Agustin Pichot.
"I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation's chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support," Beaumont said.

Beaumont won with a slim majority of 28 to 23 votes.
Bernard Laporte was voted in as the new vice-chairman.
The majority of southern hemisphere countries voted against Beaumont while he was supported by Six Nations countries.
Beaumont won 34 caps for England between 1975 and 1982 and captained them to the Grand Slam in 1980.
He's served in the position of World Rugby chairman since 2016.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bill Beaumont reelected as World Rugby chairman in close vote</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York – Former England captain Bill Beaumont will lead World Rugby for another four years after being reelected on Saturday, beating Agustin Pichot with a first-round majority.
The sport’s governing body said the 68-year-old Beaumont won by 28 votes to 23 against Pichot, the former Argentina scrumhalf who served as Beaumont's vice chairman since 2016.
Beaumont says he plans a progressive reform of governance, with an integrated approach to the global calendar; the prioritization of player welfare; an accelerated promotion of the women’s game; and giving smaller nations more matches against big nations.
"I am honored to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation’s chairman once again," Beaumont said. "I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we were aligned in many ways and I have the utmost respect for him.”
French rugby federation president Bernard Laporte — the former France coach — becomes Beaumont’s new vice chairman after running unopposed.
Laporte considers it important to unite the northern and southern hemispheres and all professional leagues "around a common objective to define a strong and lasting future.”
Beaumont begins his second term after a council meeting on May 12 and pledged to "serve for all” in the wider interests of rugby.
"We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible," he said. "We must listen to players, fans, competitions, our unions and regions, and take decisions that are in the best interests of all with our strong values to the fore.”
Beaumont was a formidable lock as a player and captained England to the then-Five Nations Grand Slam title in 1980. He has proved a popular chairman with the game’s established powers.
"Bill is ideally placed to lead and unite rugby unions in strengthening the game so we can address the immediate and longer term challenges," Bill Sweeney, chief executive of England's Rugby Football Union, said of Beaumont's victory.
The 45-year-old Pichot was looking to become the first chairman from outside the Six Nations unions or leading southern hemisphere nations. He wanted to give the less-established rugby nations a bigger say at boardroom level, take the game to a younger audience and revive the Nations League proposal abandoned less than a year ago.
He was favored by the sport’s less-wealthy nations, his appeal perhaps heightened by weighty financial concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic. Beaumont's thoughts turned immediately to helping rugby through a huge financial crisis following the pandemic outbreak.
In recent weeks he has overseen a $100 million relief package for the game. USA Rugby filed for bankruptcy in March and Rugby Australia said it was to lose around €69 million ($76.5 million) in revenue if the rest of its season was lost due to the outbreak.
"(We) must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritizes player welfare, while optimizing any opportunity to return to international rugby this year," Beaumont said. "I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterized our work so far in response to an unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach.”
Once the round of congratulations had ended, New Zealand Rugby, who had backed Pichot, weighed in to remind Beaumont of his global responsibilities.
"Gus ran a strong campaign and gave his best effort in a highly principled manner and that is all that can be asked, so we are proud of him," said New Zealand Rugby chief Brent Impey.
"There is still a level of governance reform that is overdue, and it would be good to see the courage taken to make the decisions needed to ensure the continued sustainability and success of rugby globally — not just for a limited number of Unions and regions."
Beaumont had a solid first term as chairman, with last year’s World Cup in Japan a huge success financially and in terms of attracting new fans. Japan embraced the tournament fully, making it one of the most festive and popular rugby has enjoyed.
"During this unprecedented and global COVID-19 crisis, we must act and unite unions from the north and south and the professional leagues around a common objective to define a strong and sustainable future for all," Beaumont said.
"We will pursue these reforms together and act in solidarity with the rugby family, to drive the game forward on and off the field, further the welfare of our players and make the sport more attractive and accessible."
Beaumont's nomination had been seconded by the Fiji Rugby Union, whose chairman Francis Kean was forced out of the World Rugby council following allegations of discriminatory conduct.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Northern alliance: Beaumont re-elected as World Rugby chief</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir Bill Beaumont has fought off competition from Agustin Pichot to be re- elected as the World Rugby chairman for a second term.
Beaumont won a slim 28-23 majority in the vote ahead of his vice-chairman Pichot, who will be replaced by Frenchman Bernard Laporte.
The 68-year-old former England captain will stay at the head of the governing body for the next four years, having started the role in 2016, and his primary task will be to lead the sport's response to the COVID-19 crisis.
Beaumont won the vote on the strength of the backing from northern hemisphere allies, given the southern hemisphere nations had thrown their support behind Pichot.
He said: "Over the last four years we have achieved a lot, but we are at half- time and need to press on in the second half. I now have a clear mandate to work with Bernard to implement progressive, sustainable change.
"As an organisation, we must lead, be transparent, accountable and continue to serve for all. We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible.
"We must listen to players, fans, competitions, our unions and regions, and take decisions that are in the best interests of all with our strong values to the fore.
"Now is not the time for celebration. We have work to do. We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
"I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work in response to an unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future."
Pichot, who had worked alongside Beaumont for the last four years, had promised a radical new approach had he won the election, but fell just short in his quest to usurp Beaumont.
Beaumont added: "I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we aligned in many ways, and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant."
President of the French Rugby Federation Laporte was voted into his position unopposed.
Beaumont's new four-year term will officially begin on May 12 when the results of the vote will be confirmed at World Rugby's annual meeting of council.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Beaumont re-elected as World Rugby chairman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON — Former England captain Bill Beaumont will lead World Rugby for another four years after being re-elected on Saturday, beating Agustín Pichot with a first-round majority.
The sport’s governing body said the 68-year-old Beaumont won by 28 votes to 23 against Pichot, the former Argentina scrumhalf who served as Beaumont's vice chairman since 2016.
Beaumont says he plans a progressive reform of governance, with an integrated approach to the global calendar; the prioritization of player welfare; an accelerated promotion of the women’s game; and giving smaller nations more matches against big nations.
“I am honored to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation’s chairman once again," Beaumont said. "I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we were aligned in many ways and I have the utmost respect for him.”
French rugby federation president Bernard Laporte — the former France coach — becomes Beaumont’s new vice chairman after running unopposed.
Beaumont begins his second term after a council meeting on May 12 and pledged to “serve for all” in the wider interests of rugby.
“We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible," he said. “We must listen to players, fans, competitions, our unions and regions, and take decisions that are in the best interests of all with our strong values to the fore.”
Beaumont was a formidable lock as a player and captained England to the then-Five Nations Grand Slam title in 1980. He has proved a popular chairman with the game’s established powers.
The 45-year-old Pichot was looking to become the first chairman from outside the Six Nations unions or leading southern hemisphere nations. He wanted to give the less-established rugby nations a bigger say at boardroom level, take the game to a younger audience and revive the Nations League proposal abandoned less than a year ago.
He was favored by the sport’s less wealthy nations, his appeal perhaps heightened by weighty financial concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic. Beaumont's thoughts turned immediately to helping rugby through a huge financial crisis following the pandemic outbreak.
“(We) must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritizes player welfare, while optimizing any opportunity to return to international rugby this year," Beaumont said. “I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterized our work so far in response to an unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach.”
Laporte considers it important to unite the northern and southern hemispheres and all professional leagues “around a common objective to define a strong and lasting future.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bill Beaumont fights off Agustin Pichot to win re-election as World Rugby chairman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bill Beaumont has secured a second term as chairman of World Rugby, the game's governing body.
The 68-year-old former England captain fought off competition from his former right-hand man Agustin Pichot, who was promising a more radical approach to governing the game.
However, the over-arching view is that now is not the time for sweeping changes throughout the game as it faces up to a myriad of serious challenges arising from the coronavirus pandemic.
Beaumont, who will now serve four more years, won the race vote 28-23. Frenchman Bernard Laporte will be his vice-chairman.
"I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation’s Chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support and trust," said Beaumont."I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we were aligned in many ways and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant."
Earlier this week, the Welsh Rugby Union confirmed that they had backed Beaumont for another term, despite being one of the only Six Nations Unions to bother responding to Pichot's proposals.
On Wednesday, WRU chairman Gareth Davies, who will once again sit on World Rugby's executive committee, said: "As always, it is vitally important to us that due and proper process is followed in the governance of our game in Wales and I would like to formally confirm to our members clubs the Board’s conclusion to support Bill Beaumont in his bid to be re-elected for a further term.
"We have spoken to both candidates and assessed their manifesto commitments in turn. We have digested the dynamic drive for change presented by Agustin and understood the commitment to progress but also stability and the steady hand provided by Bill.
"Some members of our Board expressed direct support for Bill and others acceded to take their steer from those of us who are closest to the issues at play.
"There were members of both our exec board and the PRB who expressed a preference for Agustin, and this was by no means a ‘one horse race’ in the Board’s eyes, but our final collective decision was reached based on evidence provided, due diligence and research of each candidate."
Beaumont's attention must now turn to the sport's fight to survive the coronavirus pandemic.
Unions all over the world and their domestic professional teams are facing an unprecedented financial crisis brought on by Covid-19.
Many have had to take drastic measures including furloughing of staff and significant pay cuts in a bid to still be in existence when the virus abates.

"Now is not the time for celebration," added Beaumont. "We have work to do. We are tackling COVID-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
"I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work so far in response to an unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bill Beaumont re-elected as World Rugby chairman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bill Beaumont has secured another four years as the chairman of rugby's governing body World Rugby. 
The former England international has been re-elected after defeating outgoing vice-chairman and ex Argentina captian Agustin Pichot by 28 votes to 23.
Beaumont had the support of the Six Nations countries and Rugby Europe ahead of Thursday's vote while Pichot's pledges had come from southern hemisphere nations.
Ex France coach Bernard Laporte has been appointed the new vice-chairman. The results of the vote had been due to be announced on May the 12th but both candidates agreed to it being brought forward.
"I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation's chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support," Beaumont said on being returned to the role.
"Now is not the time for celebration. We have work to do. We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 68-year-old won a slim majority to beat Agustin Pichot to the role.
Sir Bill Beaumont has fought off competition from Agustin Pichot to be re-elected as the World Rugby chairman for a second term.
Beaumont won a slim 28-23 majority in the vote ahead of his vice-chairman Pichot, who will be replaced by Frenchman Bernard Laporte.
The 68-year-old will stay at the head of the governing body for the next four years, having started the role in 2016, and his primary task will be to lead the sport’s response to the Covid-19 crisis.
He said: “Over the last four years we have achieved a lot, but we are at half-time and need to press on in the second half. I now have a clear mandate to work with Bernard to implement progressive, sustainable change.
“As an organisation, we must lead, be transparent, accountable and continue to serve for all. We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible.
“We must listen to players, fans, competitions, our unions and regions, and take decisions that are in the best interests of all with our strong values to the fore.
“Now is not the time for celebration. We have work to do. We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
“I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work in response to an unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future.”
Pichot, who had worked alongside Beaumont for the last four years, had promised a radical new approach had he won the election, but fell just short in his quest to usurp Beaumont.
Beaumont added: “I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we aligned in many ways, and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant.”
President of the French Rugby Federation Laporte was voted into his position unopposed.
He said: “Congratulations to my friend Sir Bill Beaumont on his re-election.
“I would also like to express my best wishes to Agustin Pichot, a legend of Argentinian rugby and a great rugby leader.
“I also want to thank all unions who have expressed their opinion in this important ballot, giving a clear mandate for the governance which Bill and I will undertake on their behalf.”
Beaumont’s new four-year term will officially begin on May 12 when the results of the vote will be confirmed at World Rugby’s annual meeting of council.

    <h5 class="mb-1">World Rugby election: Sir Bill Beaumont beats Agustin Pichot and is re-elected chairman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former England captain Sir Bill Beaumont has been re-elected as the chairman of World Rugby for another four years.
The 68-year-old defeated his former deputy, ex-Argentina skipper Agustin Pichot, by 28 votes to 23.
French Rugby president Bernard Laporte has been elected vice-chairman.
"I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation's chairman once again," said Beaumont.
"I would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support.
"I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we aligned in many ways, and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant."
Beaumont was first elected president in July 2016, succeeding Bernard Lapasset.
His re-election will be confirmed at World Rugby's annual Council meeting on 12 May, after which his new term in charge will begin.
He added: "Over the last four years we have achieved a lot, but we are at half-time and need to press on in the second half. I now have a clear mandate to work with Bernard [Laporte] to implement progressive, sustainable change.
"As an organisation, we must lead, be transparent, accountable and continue to serve for all. We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible.
"Now is not the time for celebration. We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
"I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work in response to an unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game."
Bill Sweeney, chief executive of the RFU, congratulated Beaumont on his re-election.
"Bill is ideally placed to lead and unite rugby unions in strengthening the game so we can address the immediate and longer term challenges," he said.
Chris Jones, BBC Sport rugby union correspondent
Beaumont was always the favourite for re-election, and although Pichot ran a dynamic and passionate campaign, the former England captain won in the end with a little bit to spare.
But the hard work starts now for Beaumont, who has a lot on his plate in the short, medium, and long term. Guiding the sport through the turbulence of the current situation is the immediate priority, but throughout that process he has to convince stakeholders worldwide - unions and clubs on both sides of the equator - to support his vision for the game; without that backing and collaboration, he will achieve little.
His manifesto pledges a global sport open to all. He now has the mandate to try and lead rugby union into a new era between now and 2024.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Analysing Watford's Premier League run-in - Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City to come</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Hornets have spent 25 of the 29 gameweeks in the bottom three of the Premier League, 16 of those as the side occupying bottom place.
However, Nigel Pearson's surprise appointment gave Watford enough of a lift to temporarily propel them out of the relegation zone at the time of the coronavirus-enforced shutdown.
Last season's beaten FA Cup finalists are by no means safe from the drop just yet, though, and have plenty of work to do should the campaign be given the green light to resume.
With that in mind, Sports Mole takes an in-depth look at Watford's remaining nine fixtures.
Watford were due to host Pearson's former club Leicester City in their next match - a fixture that the Hornets tend to do well in.
Indeed, they have won their last three home top-flight meetings against Leicester and have lost just two of the last 10.
That is the start of a run of winnable home games - the visit of Manchester City aside - with Southampton, Norwich City and Newcastle United next up at Vicarage Road.
The average position of Watford's remaining home opponents is 10th, but they have a pretty underwhelming record in Hertfordshire this term, winning only four out of 14 matches.
They have performed even worse on their travels, though, collecting just 10 points from a possible 45.
The average position of Watford's remaining away opponents - Burnley, Chelsea, West Ham United and Arsenal - is eighth, suggesting that points may be hard to come by.
Taking the results from the nine reverse fixtures into account, Watford are on course to add just five more points to their tally, giving them a total of 32.
That would almost certainly not be enough to keep them in the division, so Pearson will be hoping for a second bounce if he is to achieve his target of survival.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Everton evening headlines as Richarlison delivers put-down</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Here are the Everton evening headlines on Saturday, May 2.
Blues set to complete campaign on ‘neutral’ territory
Everton could play all of their remaining nine Premier League fixtures away from Goodison Park if the season resumes.
The Toffees were due to play four fixtures on the road and five fixtures at home - including the derby against Liverpool - but this now seems highly unlikely.
Proposals submitted by the league to all 20 clubs lay out plans for the remaining matches to take place at ‘eight to ten’ approved neutral venues, with no club playing at their home ground.
At present, it is unclear if and when the season will return but the Premier League have reaffirmed their commitment to completing the current campaign when it is safe to do so.
Reports in The Mirror suggest that some clubs are open to the idea of fixtures at neutral venues, with others opposed.
Richarlison happy to prove pundit wrong
Blues star Richarlison has sent a tongue-in-cheek response to a pundit who questioned his move to Goodison Park.
Rafael Honigstein, speaking to ESPN at the time of the £50 million transfer in 2018, questioned the price tag that brought the Brazilian to Merseyside from Watford.
However, the Brazilian has gone on to score 26 times in 68 appearances - including 12 so far this season - becoming one of the key players in Carlo Ancelotti’s team. 
After sharing a GIF on Twitter of himself celebrating with a “shhh” gesture, Honigstein would reply: “Fair enough, I was wrong”.
Former favourite reveals ‘surreal’ moment on Goodison return
Ex-Blue Steven Naismith has opened up on his time at Everton and the moment he scored AGAINST the club while playing for Norwich.
Midfielder Naismith would feature over 100 times for the Toffees between 2012 and 2016 before moving to Norwich.
Returning to Goodison with his new club for a League Cup tie, Naismith would find himself on the scoresheet and to his surprise, received an ovation from the home fans.
“It [the goal] was really surreal, actually, really surreal,” he told the Echo. “But when I left Everton I knew I had a good relationship with everyone at the club: the squad, the fans and the staff.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League clubs in 'bitter split' over plan involving Aston Villa</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Premier League clubs are split over the idea of finishing the season by playing the remaining fixtures at neutral grounds, according to reports.
Aston Villa have been out of action since early March, when the Premier League moved to suspend matches due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Villa's most recent clash was a 4-0 defeat to Leicester City and Dean Smith's side still have 10 matches left to play in their bid for survival.
Discussions continue to take place about the possibility of resuming the season and the Mirror reports that plans under consideration include playing fixtures at neutral stadiums.

There are 92 games still to be played but these could happen at between eight and ten venues across the country, with no side playing at their home ground. But it would appear that not all clubs agree with the proposal.
The Mirror's report says: "Some clubs are open to the idea, others bitterly opposed and it is probably easy to understand why as the top six have big money to lose along with trophies and Champions League places."
A separate report by the newspaper adds: "Big clubs made a passionate presentation at Friday’s summit about why they must finish the campaign - and stressed if they do not complete the games then it will also leave next season surrounded by uncertainty.
"But they also stressed they must avoid a 'doomsday scenario' of ending the season because of the huge impact it would have on clubs their community staff and could put thousands of jobs at risk as with any other business.
"Relegation-threatened clubs fighting for survival are against the Premier League’s plan to use between 'eight and ten approved' top flight grounds but all games would be staged in a neutral venue meaning every club loses home advantage."
It is claimed Villa Park is likely to be among the stadiums used to stage matches if the idea is given the go-ahead.

    <h5 class="mb-1">F1 hopes to start season with double-header in Austria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS — Formula One hopes to finally start the season with a double-header in the naturally isolated environment around the venue for the Austrian Grand Prix.
Despite the first 10 races having been canceled or postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, the targeted start date is July 5 in Austria. F1 still envisages holding 15 to 18 of the 22 scheduled Grands Prix.
One way to make up for lost time is having consecutive weekends on one circuit, like the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg. F1 manager director of motorsports Ross Brawn says this is a “real consideration” so long as iron-tight safety regulations are met.
“One of the logistical challenges is getting everyone tested and cleared to enter the racing environment," he told an official F1 podcast. "We can contain everyone within that environment, and therefore once we are there it is appealing to have another race the following week."
The Red Bull Ring's location in the Styrian mountains makes it naturally isolated.
“It’s pretty challenging to find the right sort of races early on where we can control the environment well enough to ensure the safety of everyone," Brawn added. “Austria fits that bill very well. It has a local airport right next to the circuit, where people can charter planes into. It’s not too close to a metropolis.”
It is unclear where F1 would race after Austria, if it even goes ahead.
The British GP is set to follow on July 19 and organizers are talking to the government about the viability of holding that race without fans. Silverstone would also reportedly be able to hold consecutive races.
The season could then continue later in the summer in Hungary, where the Hungaroring circuit is nestled in the countryside outside Budapest; and Belgium, whose Spa-Francorchamps track is within the Ardennes forest. The idea is then to move into Eurasia, Asia, and the Americas before concluding with Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in the Gulf.
“It’s important for us to try and get the season going. One reason is to excite the fans," Brawn said. "But it is (also) a very important livelihood for thousands of people.”
Guenther Steiner, the team principal of the Haas F1 team, cautiously argued in favor of giving Austria the green light.
“I think Austria is a very good place to start," Steiner said Friday in a video interview. "They have got the disease well under control at the moment and we just need to make sure that we don’t bring it back.”
Steiner also thinks consecutive races could be held there.
“I think it’s realistic. I don’t know so much about what is coming after,” he said. "Let’s hope we can get official (clearance) and we get also a good follow-up plan.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Formula One plans for 'isolated environment' to launch season in Austria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Formula One managing director Ross Brawn said the Austrian Grand Prix’s remote location makes it a logical choice as the opening race of a season heavily interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.
Organisers are aiming to start the championship, which was put on hold in March hours before the scheduled season-opener in Australia, with consecutive races at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg on July 5 and 12.
“One of the logistical challenges is getting everyone tested and cleared to enter the racing environment,” Brawn told the F1 Nation podcast. “Once we do that, it’s very attractive to keep everyone in that environment, within that biosphere that we want to create, for another race.
“It’s also pretty challenging to find the right sort of races early on where we can control the environment well enough to ensure the safety of everyone. Austria fits that bill very well. It has a local airport right next to the circuit, where people can charter planes into. It’s not too close to a metropolis.
“It has a great infrastructure around it. For instance, there will be no motorhomes, but there will be full catering facility laid on that the circuit has. We can contain everyone within that environment and therefore once we are there it is appealing to have another race the following week,” he added.
Earlier this week, Formula One boss Chase Carey targeted the season starting in Austria after the French Grand Prix, scheduled for June 28 was cancelled, becoming the 10th race of the season to be scrapped or postponed.
The Austrian Grand Prix will only be given the green light on the condition it is raced behind closed doors, the country’s health minister told organisers on Wednesday.
“Unfortunately it will be without fans, which is a great shame, but we still feel we can take the race out to all the fans and watchers on TV and other means,” said Brawn.
“It’s important for us to try and get the season going, many reasons for wanting to start the season. One is to excite the fans, who have all been frustrated with the delays. We have a very exciting season in front of us, but it is a very important livelihood for thousands of people - and that is another reason for trying to kickstart the season.”
Organisers also announced Friday the Hungarian Grand Prix on August 2 will be staged without fans in response to the health crisis. The race at the Hungaroring is following the example set by the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, scheduled for July 19.
“It has now become clear that we cannot hold the Hungarian Grand Prix in front of spectators despite all our efforts,” a statement from race organisers said.
The statement added that this decision was necessary to protect the health of fans and circuit staff alike. Their hand was forced after the Hungarian government banned any event involving more than 500 spectators until August 15.
“It became clear yesterday (Thursday) that all this is only possible behind closed gates. We will continue to work with the international promoter to find the best possible solution,” the statement added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">F1 hopes to start season with double-header in Austria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS — Formula One hopes to finally start the season with a double-header in the naturally isolated environment around the venue for the Austrian Grand Prix.
Despite the first 10 races having been cancelled or postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, the targeted start date is July 5 in Austria. F1 still envisages holding 15 to 18 of the 22 scheduled Grands Prix.
One way to make up for lost time is having consecutive weekends on one circuit, like the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg. F1 manager director of motorsports Ross Brawn says this is a "real consideration" so long as iron-tight safety regulations are met.
"One of the logistical challenges is getting everyone tested and cleared to enter the racing environment," he told an official F1 podcast. "We can contain everyone within that environment, and therefore once we are there it is appealing to have another race the following week."
The Red Bull Ring's location in the Styrian mountains makes it naturally isolated.
"It’s pretty challenging to find the right sort of races early on where we can control the environment well enough to ensure the safety of everyone," Brawn added. "Austria fits that bill very well. It has a local airport right next to the circuit, where people can charter planes into. It’s not too close to a metropolis."
It is unclear where F1 would race after Austria, if it even goes ahead.
The British GP is set to follow on July 19 and organizers are talking to the government about the viability of holding that race without fans. Silverstone would also reportedly be able to hold consecutive races.
The season could then continue later in the summer in Hungary, where the Hungaroring circuit is nestled in the countryside outside Budapest; and Belgium, whose Spa-Francorchamps track is within the Ardennes forest. The idea is then to move into Eurasia, Asia, and the Americas before concluding with Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in the Gulf.
"It’s important for us to try and get the season going. One reason is to excite the fans," Brawn said. "But it is (also) a very important livelihood for thousands of people."
Guenther Steiner, the team principal of the Haas F1 team, cautiously argued in favour of giving Austria the green light.
"I think Austria is a very good place to start," Steiner said Friday in a video interview. "They have got the disease well under control at the moment and we just need to make sure that we don’t bring it back."
Steiner also thinks consecutive races could be held there.
"I think it’s realistic. I don’t know so much about what is coming after," he said. "Let’s hope we can get official (clearance) and we get also a good follow-up plan."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus wrap: Beaumont re-elected but European Road Championships cancelled</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir Bill Beaumont insisted he had no time to celebrate his re-election as World Rugby chairman as he looks to guide to the sport through the coronavirus crisis.
Beaumont, who won a slim 28-23 majority in the vote ahead of his vice-chairman Agustin Pichot, said he wanted to see international rugby return as soon as possible.
“We have work to do,” the 68-year-old said. “We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
“I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work in response to an unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future.”
Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster says he is in the dark over Rangers’ claims they have “alarming” evidence regarding the vote which saw the Scottish league season terminated, with the Glasgow giants so far refusing to hand over any proof.
Rangers want to see Doncaster suspended after accusing the SPFL of “bullying” clubs into voting for the plan to end the three lower divisions and possibly the Premiership.
“It has been several weeks and we’ve had absolutely no idea what it was that we were supposed to have done wrong,” Doncaster told BBC Sportsound.
“We’ve had all sorts of rumour and innuendo, vague allegations but nothing specific. It’s not even a question of evidence. We don’t even know what the charges are.
“I’m hearing that this alleged dossier of evidence is due to be circulated this week. We look forward to seeing what’s in it because the sooner we can get this dealt with and move on the better.”
Cycling’s European Road Championships will not take place this year due to the pandemic, the European Cycling Union has said.
The event was due to take place from September 9-13 this year, dates that clash with the rescheduled Tour de France. Trentino, which had the hosting rights, will instead stage the event in 2021.
Cycling’s world governing body the UCI intends to issue a revised schedule for the 2020 road season on Tuesday.
The UEC said it would work with the UCI and national federations “to look at the various alternatives for the 2020 European Road Championships and UEC calendar events this season so that all titles in each category can be awarded in all disciplines”.
In cricket, World Cup winner Jason Roy believes all players should be free to make their own decisions when the action resumes.
The start of the season has been pushed back until July 1 at the earliest and the England and Wales Cricket Board is plotting how matches could be staged as and when it gets a governmental green light to proceed, including the possibility of action behind closed doors in ‘bio-secure’ environments.
“If an individual wants to go on to the front line and put himself at risk,then good on him. But if somebody doesn’t want to, then I don’t think theyshould be criticised.”
Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph has reported that England could begin their three-Test series against the West Indies on July 8 with an ECB spokesman confirming “discussions with Cricket West Indies continued on Friday”.
Olympic rower Polly Swann has joined the fight against coronavirus as a junior doctor as she continues to train for the postponed Games in Tokyo.
“A lot of junior doctors have been moved to the most critical parts of the NHS, so interim foundation year doctors are backfilling their roles,” Dr Swann said.
“I’m definitely not a frontline ICU worker, but I’m glad I can still help to ease the burden in some way.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Beaumont pips Pichot to World Rugby chairman post</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS - Former England captain Bill Beaumont has been re-elected as World Rugby chairman beating ex-Argentina skipper Agustin Pichot, the governing body announced on Saturday.
Beaumont, 68, who campaigned on the promise of opening up the sport, claimed 28 of the 51 votes to overcome the 45-year-old Pichot who planned to modernise the body and used the hashtag #GlobalGame on social media.
"I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation's Chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support," said Beaumont in a statement released by World Rugby.
The announcement of the results was brought forward from the original date of May 12 due to the smoothness of the voting process.
"Not this time, thanks to all for the support, from the bottom of my heart. #globalgame," Pichot posted on Twitter on Saturday.
Beaumont, who will have another four-year tenure, will be joined by the French Rugby Federation's chief Bernard Laporte as his vice-chairman.
The election process had been overshadowed by the resignation of Fiji Rugby Union (FRU) chairman Francis Kean from the world body's council after accusations of "rampant homophobia".
Beaumont's bid was seconded by the Pacific Island union but World Rugby stressed the former lock's nomination came from the FRU, rather than from Kean.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sir Bill Beaumont re-elected as the chairman of World Rugby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former England captain Sir Bill Beaumont has been re-elected as the chairman of World Rugby.
The 68-year-old fought off a challenge from his vice-chairman Agustin Pichot and will stay at the head of the governing body for the next four years.
Beaumont won with a slim 28-23 majority of the votes, World Rugby announced, while Bernard Laporte - the French Rugby Federation President - was voted in as the new vice-chairman.
Beaumont said: "I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation's chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support."
Rugby, like most sports, has been on hold as the coronavirus pandemic spread across the world, and it has cast doubt on whether the 2020 international calendar will be completed.
"Now is not the time for celebration," said Beaumont. "We have work to do.
"We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
"I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work in response to an unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future."
Former England and British & Irish Lions lock Beaumont, 68, succeeded France's Bernard Lapasset in 2016.
Pichot, who had worked alongside Beaumont for the last four years, had promised a radical new approach had he won the election, but fell just short.
Beaumont added: "I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years.
"While we stood against each other in this campaign, we aligned in many ways, and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant."
RFU CEO Bill Sweeney said: "On behalf of everyone at the RFU, I would like to congratulate Bill on his re-election.
"Bill is ideally placed to lead and unite rugby unions in strengthening the game, so we can address the immediate and longer term challenges."
President of the French Rugby Federation Laporte was voted into his position unopposed.
He said: "Congratulations to my friend Sir Bill Beaumont on his re-election.
"I would also like to express my best wishes to Agustin Pichot, a legend of Argentinian rugby and a great rugby leader.
"I also want to thank all unions who have expressed their opinion in this important ballot, giving a clear mandate for the governance which Bill and I will undertake on their behalf."
Beaumont's new four-year term will officially begin on May 12 when the results of the vote will be confirmed at World Rugby's annual meeting of council.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus wrap: Beaumont re-elected but European Road Championships cancelled</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir Bill Beaumont won a slim 28-23 majority in the vote ahead of his vice-chairman Agustin Pichot.
Sir Bill Beaumont insisted he had no time to celebrate his re-election as World Rugby chairman as he looks to guide to the sport through the coronavirus crisis.
Beaumont, who won a slim 28-23 majority in the vote ahead of his vice-chairman Agustin Pichot, said he wanted to see international rugby return as soon as possible.
“We have work to do,” the 68-year-old said. “We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
“I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work in response to an unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future.”
Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster says he is in the dark over Rangers’ claims they have “alarming” evidence regarding the vote which saw the Scottish league season terminated, with the Glasgow giants so far refusing to hand over any proof.
Rangers want to see Doncaster suspended after accusing the SPFL of “bullying” clubs into voting for the plan to end the three lower divisions and possibly the Premiership.
“It has been several weeks and we’ve had absolutely no idea what it was that we were supposed to have done wrong,” Doncaster told BBC Sportsound.
“We’ve had all sorts of rumour and innuendo, vague allegations but nothing specific. It’s not even a question of evidence. We don’t even know what the charges are.
“I’m hearing that this alleged dossier of evidence is due to be circulated this week. We look forward to seeing what’s in it because the sooner we can get this dealt with and move on the better.”
Cycling’s European Road Championships will not take place this year due to the pandemic, the European Cycling Union has said.
The event was due to take place from September 9-13 this year, dates that clash with the rescheduled Tour de France. Trentino, which had the hosting rights, will instead stage the event in 2021.
Cycling’s world governing body the UCI intends to issue a revised schedule for the 2020 road season on Tuesday.
The UEC said it would work with the UCI and national federations “to look at the various alternatives for the 2020 European Road Championships and UEC calendar events this season so that all titles in each category can be awarded in all disciplines”.
In cricket, World Cup winner Jason Roy believes all players should be free to make their own decisions when the action resumes.
The start of the season has been pushed back until July 1 at the earliest and the England and Wales Cricket Board is plotting how matches could be staged as and when it gets a governmental green light to proceed, including the possibility of action behind closed doors in ‘bio-secure’ environments.
Roy said: “`I don’t think I’ll have too many questions, especially when it got to the stage of ‘right, we’re going to play’ because there’ll be a lot of people inthose meetings discussing whether it’s the right thing to do or not.
“If an individual wants to go on to the front line and put himself at risk,then good on him. But if somebody doesn’t want to, then I don’t think theyshould be criticised.”
Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph has reported that England could begin their three-Test series against the West Indies on July 8 with an ECB spokesman confirming “discussions with Cricket West Indies continued on Friday”.
Olympic rower Polly Swann has joined the fight against coronavirus as a junior doctor as she continues to train for the postponed Games in Tokyo.
Swann, who took silver in the women’s eight in Rio four years ago, previously completed her medical degree and the 31-year-old has now joined the NHS to help the fight.
“A lot of junior doctors have been moved to the most critical parts of the NHS, so interim foundation year doctors are backfilling their roles,” Dr Swann said.
“I’m definitely not a frontline ICU worker, but I’m glad I can still help to ease the burden in some way.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Beaumont pips Pichot to World Rugby chairperson post</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former England captain Bill Beaumont has been re-elected as World Rugby chairperson beating ex-Argentina skipper Agustin Pichot, the governing body announced on Saturday.

Beaumont, 68, who campaigned on the promise of opening up the sport, claimed 28 of the 51 votes to overcome the 45-year-old Pichot who planned to modernise the body and used the hashtag #GlobalGame on social media.
"I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation's chairperson once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support," said Beaumont in a statement released by World Rugby.
The announcement of the results was brought forward from the original date of May 12 due to the smoothness of the voting process.
Beaumont, who will have another four-year tenure, will be joined by the French Rugby Federation's chief Bernard Laporte as his vice-chairperson.
"Congratulations to my friend Sir Bill Beaumont on his re-election. I would also like to express my best wishes to Agustin Pichot, a legend of Argentinian rugby and a great rugby leader," said Laporte, who is set to oversee France hosting the 2023 Rugby World Cup.
"I also want to thank all unions who have expressed their opinion in this important ballot, giving a clear mandate for the governance which Bill and I will undertake on their behalf," he added.
The election process had been overshadowed by the resignation of Fiji Rugby Union (FRU) chairperson Francis Kean from the world body's council after accusations of "rampant homophobia".
Beaumont's bid was seconded by the Pacific Island union but World Rugby stressed the former lock's nomination came from the FRU, rather than from Kean.
Beaumont, who made 41 Test appearances for England as well as the British and Irish Lions before retiring in 1982, has overseen a $100 million relief package for the game during the coronavirus pandemic.
USA Rugby filed for bankruptcy in March and Rugby Australia said it was to lose Au$120 million in revenue if the rest of their season was lost due to the outbreak.
"During this unprecedented and global Covid-19 crisis, we must act and unite unions from the north and south and the professional leagues around a common objective to define a strong and sustainable future for all," he said. 
"We will pursue these reforms together and act in solidarity with the rugby family, to drive the game forward on and off the field, further the welfare of our players and make the sport more attractive and accessible."
Pichot, who retired from the sport 11 years ago and had been World Rugby vice-chairperson since 2016, hinted at trying for the main position again in the future.
"Not this time, thanks to all for the support, from the bottom of my heart. #globalgame," Pichot posted on Twitter on Saturday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">De Bruyne to consider City future if European ban is upheld</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin De Bruyne has admitted he will consider his future if Manchester City's two-year ban from European competition stands, but suggested he could stay at the Etihad Stadium even if he faced a year out of the Champions League.
City were hit with the ban for "serious breaches" of UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations but have appealed against the punishment to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
There has been much speculation over the future of key players such as De Bruyne if the ban stands, but the Belgium international said he trusted the club as they insist they have done nothing wrong and can get the ban overturned.
"I'm just waiting," De Bruyne said in an interview with Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws. "The club told us they are going to appeal and they are almost 100 hundred per cent sure they are right. That's why I'm waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team.
"Once the decision is made, I will review everything. Two years would be long, but in the case of one year I might see."
Remove a European ban from the equation, and De Bruyne said he had no reason to want to leave Manchester, even if the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona came knocking.
"I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England - for my competitive view the best competition - and I like that," the 28-year-old said.
"It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too."
De Bruyne has three years remaining on his current City contract but manager Pep Guardiola will be entering the final year of his own deal next season.
But De Bruyne said his future did not depend on the Catalan's.
"I think Pep said he will take his year anyway no matter what. Then his contract ends," he said. "But I'm not going to let my decision depend on what Pep is doing.
"Of course I have already worked with other trainers and when Pep leaves, I have to continue working with someone else. But I haven't really paid much attention to that for the time being. There are more important things at the moment."
The Premier League has been suspended for six weeks due to the coronavirus, but De Bruyne said he was sure the season would be finished.
"My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks," he said. "The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give people something. Everything will be finished without fans I think. That is not really interesting for anyone, but this season will be finished.
"The financial aspect is far too important in the Premier League. If the season is not finished, it will cause serious problems."
Asked about comments from his City team-mate Sergio Aguero, who said some players were scared to return due to the threat of the virus, De Bruyne said: "I don't think people are really afraid for themselves, but for their family. That is mainly the problem for many people."

The Premier League champions received a two-year ban from Europe's premier clu competition after being found guilty of breaking Financial Fair Play regulations.
De Bruyne has now admitted the decision on City's appeal could have bearings on his future with the club.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man City morning headlines as Kevin De Bruyne drops hint over future</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">De Bruyne hints at City stay
Playmaker Kevin De Bruyne has hinted his long-term future lies at Manchester City despite the club’s European ban, which is pending an appeal.
The Belgian did admit that two years out of European competition ‘would be long’ and claimed that if the ban would be reduced to just one season, it would be much more palatable for the players.
Speaking to HLN, he explained: "I'm just waiting. The club has told us that they are going to appeal and that they are almost one hundred percent sure that they are right. That's why I'm waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team.
"Once the statement is made, I will review everything. Two years would be long, in the case of one year I might see.
“In recent years, and before then too, there have been many teams who have polled and may have asked what I like. But to be honest, I'm very happy with City.
"I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England - for my view the best competition - and I like that. It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too. What is coming is coming. But it's not that I've tried to leave City in those five years. I have also remained calm for my previous transfers. I have never had any problems and have always waited for my moment. With respect, because I think you get most of it back. Even outside of football.”
Matondo reveals Sane’s Schalke advise
Teenage winger Rabbi Matondo left City in January 2019 to join Schalke and he has revealed Leroy Sane, formerly of the Bundesliga club, advised him on the move.
The Wales international moved to Germany in an £8million deal and has scored once in 20 appearances for the club, whom he joined in search of first-team football.
"At Manchester City, I was doing well and getting a lot of attention from other clubs, telling me they wanted me in the first team. I wasn't really in and around the first team at City so much. I wasn't getting a sniff of being on the bench," Matondo told the Daily Mail.
"Manchester City is a top club and I've lots of respect for them. At the time I was thinking about my own development and thought a move abroad might be the one for me.
"There was a lot of talk at the time about how not many young players were breaking through in the Premier League and I was thinking it might be right to move abroad and get some good experience. Maybe some life lessons as well.
"Not a lot of people can say they moved abroad to work at 18 and lived alone. I thought it would be good for me. I thought I was mature and it's been the right thing for me.
"He (Sane) told me the fans were top fans and would love me forever if I worked hard and did the right things. He gave me advice on the Schalke way."
Aguero reveals key dietary change
City record goalscorer Sergio Aguero has revealed how he used to suffer dizzy spells on the pitch before altering his diet.
Aguero ditched the prime Argentine beef which was a big part of his previous diet and upon receiving advice, opted to consume more chicken and rice.
The 31-year-old now only uses the asado – a traditional South American grill – once a week or less, and he feels all the better for it.
Aguero told TYC Sports: “I think it was from 2013 to 2016 that I could not adapt to food well.
“From there I met an Italian doctor online - and he changed my mind a little.
“I told him what I usually ate, which was to eat a lot of meat, and when he told me to try it just once a week I was like 'uhhh'.
“Then I adapted. He told me that when I am very hungry I should put rice and chicken together – and today I am a big fan of rice.
“In football, even if it's only half-a-kilo, you feel the difference. It is incredible."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man City superstar could stay even if Champions League ban is upheld</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In what is potentially some good news among the enveloping gloom at Man City, one of their superstar players has hinted that he could still stay at the club, even if their Champions League ban is upheld.
According to an interview with HLN and cited by the Manchester Evening News, Kevin De Bruyne will consider staying at the Etihad Stadium if the ban is reduced to one year rather than the current two that Pep Guardiola’s side have hanging over them.
“I’m just waiting. The club has told us that they are going to appeal and that they is (sic) almost one hundred percent sure that they are right. That’s why I’m waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team,” he said.
“Once the statement is made, I will review everything. Two years would be long, in the case of one year I might see.
“[…] I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England – for my competitive view the best competition – and I like that. It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too. What is coming is coming. But it’s not that I’ve tried to leave City in those five years. I have also remained calm for my previous transfers.”
The outlet go on to suggest that the Belgian does want to win European club football’s glamour trophy, and to that end, a two-year hiatus for a 28-year-old may prove unworkable, but City’s supporters will surely be delighted with the attacking midfielder’s current stance.
At this point the messages remain mixed, and that is perhaps understandable with the business of football completely up in the air at the moment because of the coronavirus crisis.
One things is almost certain, however, and that is that City seem to be a much better proposition with De Bruyne in their team than without him, and it’s not too much of a stretch to believe that City will do all they can to try and keep hold of him.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kevin De Bruyne says he could quit Man City if Champions League ban is upheld</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin De Bruyne has hinted that he could quit Manchester City if the club's Champions League ban is upheld.
The Belgian international insists that his future at the Etihad will NOT be shaped by whether Pep Guardiola decides to sign a new contract to stay at the club.
But he has revealed his concern over UEFA's decision to ban the Blues from Europe for two seasons for breaking FFP regulations.
And De Bruyne has admitted for the first time that it might have a bearing on where he will spend the peak years of his career.
De Bruyne said: “I'm just waiting. The club has told us that they are going to appeal - and that they are almost 100 percent sure that they are right.
“That's why I'm waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team.
“Once the statement is made, I will review everything.
“Two years would be long. In the case of one year I might see.”
De Bruyne, talking on a video call with Belgian publication HLN, was asked about whether Guardiola's plans would affect his future.
The Catalan is out of contract in the summer of 2021, but the midfielder replied: “Not particularly.
“I think Pep said he will be here next year anyway, no matter what.
“Then his contract ends. But I'm not going to let my decision depend on what Pep is doing.
“Of course I have already worked with other trainers and when Pep leaves, I have to continue working with someone else.
“But I haven't really paid much attention to that for the time being.
“There are more important things at the moment.”
There will be no shortage of takers should De Bruyne decide to leave Manchester if City's ban is confirmed when the Court of Arbitration for Sport hears their appeal.
Real Madrid and Barcelona are big admirers, while Bayern Munich tried to land the 28-year-old before he joined City in a £55million deal from Wolfsburg in the summer of 2015.
He was outstanding when City beat Madrid 2-1 in the Bernabeu in the Champions League in March, captaining the side and scoring the winner from the penalty spot.
De Bruyne said: “To be honest, I'm very happy with City. 
“I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England - for my competitive view the best competition - and I like that.
“It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too.
“What is coming is coming. But it's not that I've tried to leave City in those five years.
“I have also remained calm for my previous transfers.
“I have never had any problems and have always waited for my moment.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Maradona was pure art, Messi is a Speedy Gonzales - Ayala</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Diego Maradona was "pure art" and Lionel Messi is "a Speedy Gonzales", according to Argentina assistant coach Roberto Ayala.
Ayala played alongside Maradona at the start of his career and in his twilight years lined up with Messi.
The former Napoli, Milan and Valencia centre-back believes there are significant differences between the two players widely regarded as the best to have come out of Argentina.
"I played with both of them, with Diego I was taking my first steps. They are two footballing giants, and when he retires, Messi will be remembered," Ayala told FOX Sports.
"I don't know if it'll be like Diego, it doesn't matter. They are different. Diego was pure art in all his mannerisms, Messi a Speedy Gonzales who carries the ball two centimetres from his foot."
Messi's failure to win a senior international title with Argentina often counts against him when he is compared to Maradona, who spearheaded the country's success at the 1986 World Cup.
Barcelona star Messi has suffered defeat in four finals – three at the Copa America and the 2014 World Cup – but Ayala is confident he can be successful with Argentina.
Ayala has been impressed by the six-time Ballon d'Or winner's humility in the national team set-up.
"I hope that he gives us his footballing level, that he makes us grow as a team. Having a team with him, not of him," said Ayala.
"He wants to be treated like this, like just one more. We told the players, 'He will not be treated differently by us. You all have to step up, do what you do for your clubs, and he will help you. You have to take advantage of that.'"

Martinez, 46, reached an agreement in principle with the Belgian football federation three weeks ago, according to La Derniere Heure newspaper. 
The Spaniard’s contract was due to run out after this year’s European Championship, which was pushed back until 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Reports indicate Martinez, who took Belgium to third place at the 2018 World Cup, would double his current annual salary of 1.2 million euros ($1.33 million).
The former Everton, Wigan and Swansea manager replaced Marc Wilmots as Belgium boss in August 2016.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Martinez extends Belgium contract till 2022</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Share on FacebookShare on Twitter
Belgium coach Roberto Martinez has extended his contract through to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, ending weeks of speculation about a new deal, Belgian media reported on Saturday.
There was no official confirmation from the Belgian football association but newspapers said Martinez would stay in charge through to the next World Cup after negotiating a new two-year deal.
His contract was up after this year’s European Championship, which has been shifted back a year because of the coronavirus crisis.
Martinez, 46, had already said in interviews over the last weeks he wanted to stay in charge in order to take Belgium to Euro 2021, where they are drawn in Group B and will play Denmark, Finland and Russia.
The team, who are top of the FIFA world rankings, had qualified in imposing fashion, by winning all 10 qualifiers, scoring 40 goals and conceding just three.
Spanish-born Martinez, the former Wigan Athletic and Everton manager, took Belgium to third place at the World Cup and is popular among the players, reports added.
With much of Belgium’s 2018 World Cup squad set to be in their early 30’s or approaching retirement by the end of the 2022 tournament in Qatar.
The next two tournaments will be seen as crunch moments for a golden generation.
Eden Hazard will be 31-years-old and Kevin de Bruyne 30 after Qatar, and will be primed to lead Belgium to rival France’s reigning champions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Football: Martinez to stay in charge of Belgium until next World Cup</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRUSSELS: Belgium coach Roberto Martinez has extended his contract through to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, ending weeks of speculation about a new deal, Belgian media reported on Saturday (May 2).
There was no official confirmation from the Belgian football association but newspapers said Martinez would stay in charge through to the next World Cup after negotiating a new two-year deal.
His contract was up after this year’s European Championship, which has been shifted back a year because of the coronavirus crisis.
Martinez, 46, had already said in interviews over the last weeks he wanted to stay in charge in order to take Belgium to Euro 2021, where they are drawn in Group B and will play Denmark, Finland and Russia.
The team, who are top of the FIFA world rankings, had qualified in imposing fashion, by winning all 10 qualifiers, scoring 40 goals and conceding just three.
Spanish-born Martinez, the former Wigan Athletic and Everton manager, took Belgium to third place at the World Cup and is popular among the players, reports added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AP report: MLB draft still likely to begin on June 10</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK — Major League Baseball owners will discuss a length for the amateur draft next week and are likely to start the selections on the original date of June 10, a person familiar with the deliberations told The Associated Press.
Teams and the players’ association agreed March 26 to a deal that allowed MLB to cut the draft from 40 rounds to as few as five this year and 20 next year, part of a plan to deal with the new coronavirus pandemic that delayed the start of the season and slashed revenue. As part of the agreement, the sides agreed to leave the assigned slot values of draft signing bonuses at the same level in 2020 and 2021 as they were last year.
That left the total of slot values for a 10-round draft this year at $265.5 million, including $29.6 million for rounds six through 10.
MLB proposed to the union that it would guarantee a 10-round draft in exchange for the slot values for rounds 6-10 being cut by 50%. The union rejected that plan, a person familiar with the decision said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the move was not announced.
The union’s decision to reject the plan was first reported by The Athletic and the move to keep the draft on June 10 by the New York Post.
Rather than resume negotiations, teams intend to debate the size of the draft and make a decision, the person said.
Signing bonus pools started in 2012 and limit the amount of money teams can spend. Each slot in the first 10 rounds is a signed a value — the range last year was $8,415,300 down to $142,200 — and each team’s values are added to a form a pool. Signing bonuses in the first 10 rounds count against the pool along with the amounts above $125,000 of players selected after the 10th round or who were bypassed in the draft and then signed.
A team that exceeds it pool is taxed, and a club more than 5% above loses a first-round draft pick the next year — a threshold never reached.
As part of the March agreement, players and teams agreed that any draft-eligible player not selected this year or next would be limited to a signing bonus of no more than $20,000.
MLB’s offer that the union rejected included an additional limit of only five bypassed players at up to $20,000, with the rest held to a maximum of $5,000.
The union agreed in March that signing bonuses can be deferred: up to $100,000 will be due within 30 days of approval, and 50% of the rest payable on July 1 in each of the following two years.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ANKARA: With the future of pro basketball uncertain in the shadow of coronavirus, the NBA has postponed its annual draft lottery and draft combine.
The draft lottery was to be held this month in Chicago, while the draft combine was set for May 19-24.
"More information on each event will be shared at a later date as the NBA continues to closely monitor the coronavirus pandemic and consult with infectious disease specialists, public health experts and government officials,” said a NBA statement.
The 2019-20 NBA season has been suspended since March 11 and there has been no decision yet on its resumption.
On Monday, the NBA announced it will not allow teams to reopen training facilities until at least May 8 to give them more time to implement new safety guidelines.
The US is the world’s hardest-hit country in the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 1.10 million cases and more than 65,000 deaths.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NBA pushes back draft combine, draft lottery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NBA is delaying the draft lottery and draft combine, events scheduled for Chicago later this month.
The league made the decision Friday, though it has been expected for some time. The lottery cannot occur until the regular season is completed or is declared over, because team records determine the odds that the 14 non-playoff teams will have of securing the right to pick No. 1 overall in the draft.
MAVERICKS OWNER MARK CUBAN 'CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC' NBA CAN FINISH SEASON
For now, the draft remains scheduled for June 25 — though that, too, will likely have to change in the coming weeks as the league continues reacting to the coronavirus pandemic.
The lottery was to have taken place May 19. The draft combine was to have run from May 21-24.
The league typically invites about 70 players to the combine, where some of the candidates work out and play in scrimmages and others skip the on-court events entirely and just interview with teams instead. The combine has also been a chance for teams to conduct physicals with players, a key component of the evaluation process.
The NBA has been looking at several options for weeks about the draft schedule and pre-draft events, just as the league has when it comes to possibilities for resuming the season when public health officials say that would be appropriate.
“There are no target dates. There are more target responsibilities,” San Antonio CEO R.C. Buford said earlier this week. “And there’s still questions. We just got the early entry candidates list in the last couple days. That at least gives some kind of clarity on who the draft pool will be. But from there, we don’t have clarity on the Chicago pre-draft or medicals or all the things that go on with draft preparation.”

The NBA has not played since March 11, when it became the first of the major U.S. pro sports leagues to suspend games because of the pandemic. The league has missed 259 regular-season games because of the shutdown, and the playoffs would have started about two weeks ago.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NBA pushes back draft lottery, combine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES, USA – The NBA postponed the draft lottery and draft combine on Friday, May 1, but gave no indication whether it plans to do the same for the 2020 entry draft.
The lottery was scheduled for May 19 and the three-day combine was set to start on May 21.
There was also no word on the fate of the June 25 draft but ESPN reported that the board of governors was seriously considering moving it to a later date as well.
The US broadcaster also said the start of next season could be postponed until December.
The NBA said in a news release that information on a new date for the lottery and combine would come later.
"The NBA continues to closely monitor the coronavirus pandemic and consult with infectious disease specialists, public health experts and government officials," the statement said.
The NBA shut down on March 11 after Utah Jazz centre Rudy Gobert tested positive for the virus. – Rappler.com

    <h5 class="mb-1">England skipper Root involved in talks to reschedule Windies Test series</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England captain Joe Root and his West Indies counterpart Jason Holder have been involved in talks over rescheduling a three-Test series between the two sides later this summer in the UK.
The Daily Telegraph has reported that England could begin their three-Test series against the West Indies on July 8, with an ECB spokesman confirming discussions with Cricket West Indies continued this week.
"Positive ongoing discussions with the ECB and CWI continued on Friday," a spokesperson said.
"Both boards were represented including captains, coaches, administrators and the chief medical officers from the respective boards.
"Discussions were wide-ranging including dialogue around revised schedules and COVID-19 medical and biosecurity planning.
"Meetings will be ongoing over the next few months to reach an outcome of when international cricket could potentially return.
"This is a long and detailed process and is very much in the early stages of planning. The guidance from the Government will emphasise what we can do."
The ECB has suspended all professional cricket until July 1 due to the coronavirus pandemic, with growing doubts over the domestic season after the launch of new flagship tournament The Hundred was postponed until next summer.
England completed a tour of South Africa in mid-February before heading to Sri Lanka the following month, but that trip was curtailed midway through the match against the Sri Lanka Board President's XI as England headed home due to growing concerns over the pandemic.
The three-Test series against the West Indies was originally due to begin on June 4 at the Oval before Australia arrived for white-ball cricket in July.
Pakistan were then due to play three Tests against England in August.
The reported plan to start the series against the West Indies on July 8 would allow players to take part in a handful of warm-up matches assuming the current suspension is lifted at the start of July.
The series against Pakistan could then begin a few days later than planned on August 5, with the three ODIs and three T20 matches with Australia moved to September.

    <h5 class="mb-1">SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster in the dark over “vague allegations”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster says he is in the dark over Rangers’ insistence he is suspended from his role following the vote to end the Scottish league season.
Rangers claimed to have “alarming” evidence that raised serious concerns over the process of the recent ballot on the termination of the season and called for Doncaster and SPFL legal advisor Rod McKenzie to be suspended, but refused to hand over any proof.
The Gers also accused the SPFL of “bullying” clubs into voting for the plan to end the three lower divisions and possibly the Premiership, which was backed by four out of five clubs.
“It has been several weeks and we’ve had absolutely no idea what it was that we were supposed to have done wrong,” Doncaster told BBC Sportsound.
“We’ve had all sorts of rumour and innuendo, vague allegations but nothing specific. It’s not even a question of evidence. We don’t even know what the charges are.
“I’m hearing that this alleged dossier of evidence is due to be circulated this week. We look forward to seeing what’s in it because the sooner we can get this dealt with and move on the better.”
“It’s extremely disappointing that these vague allegations are out there with no one actually coming forward and saying, ‘I was bullied by someone within the SPFL staff’.
“I do not believe for a moment that anyone has been bullied by a member of the SPFL staff. Least of all myself.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster in the dark over “vague allegations”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scottish Professional Football League chief says ‘we have no idea what it was we’re supposed to have done wrong’.
Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster says he is in the dark over Rangers’ insistence he is suspended from his role following the vote to end the Scottish league season.
Rangers claimed to have “alarming” evidence that raised serious concerns over the process of the recent ballot on the termination of the season and called for Doncaster and SPFL legal advisor Rod McKenzie to be suspended, but refused to hand over any proof.
The Gers also accused the SPFL of “bullying” clubs into voting for the plan to end the three lower divisions and possibly the Premiership, which was backed by four out of five clubs.
“It has been several weeks and we’ve had absolutely no idea what it was that we were supposed to have done wrong,” Doncaster told BBC Sportsound.
“We’ve had all sorts of rumour and innuendo, vague allegations but nothing specific. It’s not even a question of evidence. We don’t even know what the charges are.
“I’m hearing that this alleged dossier of evidence is due to be circulated this week. We look forward to seeing what’s in it because the sooner we can get this dealt with and move on the better.”
“It’s extremely disappointing that these vague allegations are out there with no one actually coming forward and saying, ‘I was bullied by someone within the SPFL staff’.
“I do not believe for a moment that anyone has been bullied by a member of the SPFL staff. Least of all myself.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Neil Doncaster: SPFL chief 'entirely mystified' by Rangers' claims</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chief executive Neil Doncaster is "entirely mystified" by what evidence Rangers have against him and the SPFL, and denies any allegations of bullying.
Rangers have said they can prove a "lack of fair play" in April's SPFL ballot to end the lower leagues and have forced an EGM on 12 May. They also called for Doncaster and SPFL legal adviser Rod McKenzie to be suspended.
"It has been several weeks and we've had absolutely no idea what it was that we were supposed to have done wrong," Doncaster told Sportsound.
"We've had all sorts of rumour and innuendo, vague allegations but nothing specific. It's not even a question of evidence. We don't even know what the charges are.
"I'm hearing that this alleged dossier of evidence is due to be circulated this week. We look forward to seeing what's in it because the sooner we can get this dealt with and move on the better."
Doncaster said he assumed Rangers had something "pretty powerful" given their actions. However, he insisted that nobody had come to the SPFL with any claims of bullying.
"It's extremely disappointing that these vague allegations are out there with no one actually coming forward and saying 'I was bullied by someone within the SPFL staff'," he said.
"I do not believe for a moment that anyone has been bullied by a member of the SPFL staff. Least of all myself."
In a wide-ranging interview on BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound, Doncaster also said:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19 infections at Cologne raise questions over safety of Bundesliga's return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Covid-19 infection of three people at German top-flight football team FC Cologne has raised questions about the safety of a possible Bundesliga restart amid the coronavirus pandemic.
With the Bundesliga battling to convince the government that the season should restart in May, and with daily infection figures dropping, Cologne announced the positive tests on Friday (May 1).
“Likely two players, one staffer infected,” wrote Karl Lauterbach, senior lawmaker with the Social Democrats, junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition, on Twitter on Saturday.
“The rest (of the squad) continues to train. Whoever trains with Covid-19 risks damages to lung, heart and kidneys,” added Lauterbach, who is a professor of health economics and epidemiology.
“I am surprised that players are allowing this,” he said in reference to Cologne’s training continuing with the rest of the squad instead of them all being quarantined as a precaution.
“Football should be a model example and not ‘bread and games’,” he said.
Cologne had said all three cases were symptom-free and the individuals were placed in a 14-day quarantine, but the club did not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those concerned, nor did it say whether players were involved.
While Bundesliga clubs have returned to training in small groups in the past weeks after the league was suspended in mid-March, they must wait another week to find out about a possible restart to the season.
The German government on Thursday delayed any decision over a league resumption amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The cash-strapped clubs and league had been hoping for the green light to end the two-month suspension so the league can contractually finish by June 30.
The German Football League has also submitted a health safety plan for games without spectators that foresees regular testing of players but no quarantine for entire squads in cases of positive tests.
Chancellor Merkel has said any decision on if and when sports could resume would be taken on May 6.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FC Koln COVID-19 cases raise question on safety of football restart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berlin: The news of three FC Koln players testing positive for novel coronavirus has raised questions in Germany of the safety behind restarting the football season in May.
A senior lawmaker with the Social Lawmakers, junior partner to Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition, has said that the rest of the squad, who will continue to train, risk damage to lung, heart and kidneys if they are carrying the virus.
"Likely two players, one staffer infected," wrote Karl Lauterbach, who is also a professor of health, economics and epidemiology, on Twitter. "The rest (of the squad) continues to train. Whoever trains with COVID-19 risks damages to lung, heart and kidneys."
Lauterbach expressed surprise that the players are not opposing the continuation of training instead of being quarantined. "Football should be a model example and not 'bread and games'," he said.
The German side recently returned to training in groups and had the entire playing squad, as well as the coaching and background staff tested for the coronavirus this week.
"Three people tested positive, all are symptom-free. After an assessment of the cases by the responsible health authorities, the three people who tested positive will go into a 14-day quarantine at home," FC Koln said in an official statement on their official website.
"FC Koln will not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those affected. FC Koln's training can continue as planned, according to the hygiene and infection control measures that have been in place since April 6th in group training," it added.
German Football League (DFL) Chief Executive Christian Seifert had last week said that it is hoping to restart league football in the country on May 9 provided they get the green light from the country's government. The German football season was halted on March 13 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rafael backs Trent Alexander-Arnold to surpass Man Utd legend as a footballer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Manchester United star Rafael has backed Trent Alexander-Arnold to ‘pass Gary Neville as a footballer’ if he continues to thrive and win trophies in a Liverpool shirt.
Alexander-Arnold broke into Jurgen Klopp’s first-team back in 2016 and the 21-year-old right-back has since established himself as one of the most exciting youngsters in European football.
The England international won the Champions League, the Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup with the Reds last season and was also named in the PFA Team of the Year after an outstanding individual campaign.

Asked to choose between Alexander-Arnold and former team-mate Neville, Rafael told ESPN: ‘Today I would pick Gary Neville but if Alexander-Arnold keeps doing what he’s doing he will pass Gary Neville by far.
‘At the moment he’s just destroying the Premier League with assists, with everything. I have to be honest. So if he keeps going like that he’s going to pass Gary Neville as a footballer.
‘When Gary Neville was young he maybe didn’t have the same qualities, wasn’t doing the same things that Alexander-Arnold was doing but he kept doing what he did for 12-13 years in Manchester and England.
‘I hope Alexander-Arnold keeps playing well, not against Manchester United for sure, but if he keeps doing that he will for sure pass Gary Neville.’
Earlier this month, Rafael admitted it would be ‘great’ if Liverpool are denied their first Premier League title in 30 years due to the coronavirus crisis.
Asked to reveal the highlight of his United career, the Brazilian told the club’s official website: ‘I always say that when you get to 18 titles, and when you pass Liverpool!
‘Everybody’s talking about “stop the competition”, no? They don’t get to 20!
‘It will be hard for them (if the Premier League is voided), great for us!
‘But that (winning the 19th title in 2011) was my best moment.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dutch legend says Arsenal-linked £24m man is ‘one of the best’ players in Holland</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reported Arsenal target Orkun Kokcu has been described as “one of the best midfield players” in the Netherlands by Dutch legend Jaap Stam, in conversation with Goal.com.
Spanish outlet La Razon has claimed that the Gunners are willing to make a €26.5million (around £24million) bid for the Feyenoord gem.
The 19-year-old has already made 47 senior appearances for the Rotterdam club, scoring seven goals and registering 10 assists in all competition.
Kokcu has played 35 times this season, scoring three goals and claiming six assists, and is turning plenty of heads in the Eredivisie and beyond.
Stam, who coached Feyenoord at the start of the season, thinks Kokcu has the ability to eventually make the step up at Arsenal, but also believes he should remain in Rotterdam for now.
He told Goal.com: “He would need to adjust because the step to Arsenal and the Premier League is totally different when you compare it to Holland. The pace of the game, the quality, the intensity is a lot higher. But he has the ability.
“He’s certainly got the ability to make that step to the Premier League. He has creativity, scoring ability, stamina and running ability. He keeps on going. I saw him as a very promising player… now he’s proving himself in Holland and is one of the best midfield players in the country.
“The only thing he needs to work a little more on is the defensive part of his game. Ideally it would be good for him to stay in Holland, to adjust even more to playing three games a week and to get used to the intensity. But also to become more steady as a player because he is very young.”
Stam knows Kokcu well, having given him the opportunity at the start of the season, which he has taken with both hands, and is now attracting interest from outside the Netherlands.
A skilful, technically gifted midfielder, the Turkey Under-21 international has been deployed as a number 10, as a box-to-box midfielder and even as a defensive midfielder.
In addition, Kokcu also has an eye for goal, finishing as Feyenoord Under-19s top goalscorer in 2017-18 (Football Oranje).
All in all, he seems just the kind of addition Arsenal could work with and help progress further.

    <h5 class="mb-1">James Milner compares 'Rolls-Royce' Virgil van Dijk with Vincent Kompany</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">James Milner has described Liverpool defensive stalwart Virgil van Dijk as "more of a Rolls-Royce" than former Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany.
The former England international has played with both centre-backs and was given the testing job of picking between them.
Under Kompany's captaincy, Milner won two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the League Cup before joining Liverpool in 2015.
With the Reds, Milner has won the Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup thanks in part to the remarkable defensive performances of van Dijk.
And the 34-year-old believes Kompany and van Dijk possess different attributes while refusing to be drawn into saying that one player is superior.
Questioned about the duo by Sky Sports, Milner said: "They are massive players. You always look at the spine of a successful team and it starts right through the middle with the leaders at the back and how important defending is.
"Vinny - unbelievable player. How he went about his business, he struggled with injuries but the amount of injuries you saw him play through as well which nobody would have ever known, was incredible.

"Vinny - unbelievable player. How he went about his business, he struggled with injuries but the amount of injuries you saw him play through as well which nobody would have ever known, was incredible.
"He would put his head on the line. An unbelievable leader, a great captain with so many great qualities on that side, and rightly so, one of the greatest defenders to play in the Premier League.
"Virgil is probably a bit different to that. Maybe a bit more of a Rolls-Royce, if you like, and he doesn't seem to make too many tackles. He gets in the right spot and moves the ball away."
Milner also assessed the pair's ball-playing and shooting ability, recalling Kompany's thunderous strike to earn Manchester City a valuable three points over Leicester City last season.
"Maybe he's [van Dijk's] got a few more diagonals in his locker than Vinny had, although Vinny did have that as well," Milner added. "And Vinny had the greatest ball strike, I suppose, when he lashed one into the top corner! So, he could strike a ball alright as well."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Germany international has starred for his current club this season, contributing 25 goals and nine assists in the Bundesliga and Champions League.
However, with a release clause in his contract, the 24-year-old has been frequently linked with a switch to Liverpool during the next transfer window.
According to journalist Nicola Schira, the Merseyside giants and the player's representatives have made significant progress in talks over recent weeks.
Schira claims that Liverpool are prepared to hand Werner a five-year contract worth €10m (£8.87m) per year.
The attacker, who has also been linked with Chelsea, has revealed that he is keen to move abroad in the near future.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Director drops big hint Arsenal-linked £53m ‘huge player’ could move in the summer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reported Arsenal target Dayot Upamecano could potentially be on the move this summer, with RB Leipzig managing director Oliver Mintzlaff saying his side’s top players will not be leaving for free.
Upamecano is one of the most sought-after defenders in world football at the moment and the fact his contract expires at the end of the 2020-21 season makes him even more appealing to potential suitors.
According to Bild, the 21-year-old is available for around £53million in the summer transfer window and so far he has refused to extend his current deal with RB Leipzig, with Arsenal said to be keen on the centre-back after previously failing to sign him.
In October last year, the Gunners were deemed to be frontrunners for the Frenchman’s signature along with AC Milan (Calciomercato), but since then, numerous other clubs, including Liverpool and Tottenham, have been linked with his services (The Mirror).
Upamecano is also said to be on the wishlists of both Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola and Manchester United counterpart Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, both clubs reportedly interested in bolstering their defensive ranks this summer (Sky Sports).
“We know the terms of our players’ contracts and I know them very well – especially that of our top performers,” Mintzlaff told Sport1, as quoted by the Evening Standard.
“For us, it is a no go that the top performers will be allowed to leave our club free of charge. That’s the case with Timo Werner and that will be the case with Dayot Upamecano. I have the economic stability of the club in mind.”
Aside from the plaudits sent Upamecano’s way – Lothar Matthaus has called him a “huge player” – the France Under-21 defender’s displays have often spoken for themselves, in particular his shutout of Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski in the goalless draw between the two sides earlier this year.
A big, strong centre-back with explosive pace and superb reading of the game, it’s unsurprising to see the Premier League’s top sides all linked with him, and given how much interest there seems to be in him, not to mention the fact he isn’t expected to let his contract run down, there could well be a bidding war this summer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Arsenal transfer news: Boost in race for centre-back, striker target could be available for £20m</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Arsenal are gearing up for what is Mikel Arteta’s first full summer transfer window as Gunners boss and the London club have been linked with a host of potential targets as the window approaches.
According to the Express, the Gunners have been handed a boost in their pursuit of RB Leipzig defender Dayot Upamecano.
Upamecano is out of contract at Leipzig in 2021 and hasn’t signed a new contract as yet which leaves his future wide open with Arsenal reportedly interested in signing the defender.
The 21-year-old centre-back has established himself as one of the brightest young defensive prospects in Europe this season and has a release clause of £53m.
However, Arsenal are yet to submit a bid for the defender but remain interested in signing him with Gunners boss Mikel Arteta keen on bolstering his defence this summer transfer window.
Elsewhere, Celtic’s 22-year-old star forward Odsonne Edouard could be on the move to the Premier League with Arsenal in pole position to sign the striker, according to a report in the Mirror. 
The report states that Arsenal are keen on bringing Edouard to the Emirates with Gunners star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s future under constant doubt.
Edouard has been in superb form for Celtic this season and has scored 24 goals for the Scottish club before the Scottish Premier League was suspended due to the coronavirus.
According to the report, Edouard could be available for as little as £20m this summer, with several Premier League clubs interested in signing him from Celtic and Arsenal are one of the clubs vying to sign the striker.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FIFA vice-president ponders calendar year season in Europe</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ROME - FIFA vice-president Victor Montagliani has said that moving the European soccer season to the calendar year is a “possibility to be discussed” in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic which has brought football to a standstill around the world.
In an interview with Italy’s Radio Sportiva, Montagliani, who is seen as a close ally of FIFA president Gianni Infantino, said the move would fit in with the 2022 World Cup being played in Qatar in November and December.
The head of world soccer’s governing body himself has said that football will be totally different when it restarts and that the current stoppage could be a good chance to overhaul the overloaded calendar which is due to run until 2024.
“We have the opportunity because the World Cup in Qatar in 2022 will be played in November/December and that could be the idea,” said Montagliani, who is president of the CONCACAF confederation.
“Here in the Americas, the season is already played according to the calendar year, perhaps it is a solution that could also be used in Europe and Africa, it is a possibility to be discussed at national and continental level,” he said.
“It is not an idea to be discarded, it can be a solution in view of the next two years and this winter World Cup”.
A number of European leagues, including Italy, Germany and England, still hope to finish their seasons but doing so could force the start of the 2020-21 campaign to be pushed back. UEFA also wants to finish the Champions League and Europa League.
“We had already started thinking about how to set a new calendar from 2024, now with this crisis, we need immediate answers,” added Montagliani.
The idea of a calendar-year season has been put forward before including by Karl-Heinz Rummenigge when he was chairman of the European Club Association (ECA).
“Everywhere, be it Germany, France or England, summer is the best period of the year. And that is the season we don’t play,” he told France Football magazine in a 2013 interview.
“In deepest winter, when it is very cold and snowing, we play nearly all the time in conditions that are disagreeable for both players and spectators. It is not logical.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">British Grand Prix 'not a given' in Formula 1, says Silverstone boss Stuart Pringle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">London: This year's British Grand Prix "is not a given" even without spectators and the decision depends on others, Silverstone managing director Stuart Pringle said on Saturday.
Formula One plans to start the season, put on hold by the COVID-19 pandemic, with two races behind closed doors in Austria in early July before potentially two more at Silverstone.
Any races will need government approval, with countries in various stages of lockdown with restrictions on movement and mass events.
Silverstone is keen to help the sport back on track but announced this week any race could only go ahead without spectators.
"The end of April (decision deadline) for us was if we had to start putting up temporary infrastructure for hospitality and dealing with the public and stuff," Pringle told Reuters.
"We are only working on fixed infrastructure (now) so it's an awful lot less.
"I'm confident we could operate well within F1's decision-making cycle," he said of any new deadline. "I think they are the ones who have got to make the decision." Formula One's managing director Ross Brawn said the sport wanted to create a "kind of biosphere" at circuits.
That would involve getting everyone who entered the circuit tested and cleared for the coronavirus and then keeping them in a controlled environment.
"Austria fits that bill very well. It's got a local airport right next to the circuit, where people can charter planes into. It's not too close to a metropolis, it has a great infrastructure around it," Brawn told an F1 podcast.
"There will be no motorhomes, but there will be a full catering facility laid on that the circuit has."
Formula One insiders have spoken of teams staying at secure hotels with no interaction with local residents and no media access.
Pringle said Silverstone, a home race for seven of the 10 teams, could offer security.
"In the discussions within sport, about restarting in the UK, there's been talk about the need for sites to be a bit like an island. To be controlled. We can achieve that," he said.
"We have all the facilities we need inside the circuit with the exception of a complete hotel. We have a half-built hotel, if that helps anyone.
Silverstone, a former World War Two airfield in central England, has a 222 hectare site with a nearly 8km perimeter fence.
The Wing building is some 400m long and can deliver 4,500 sit down lunches simultaneously with its own kitchens and five separate halls.
"We'd comfortably cater for everybody associated with putting it on," said Pringle. "We could separate people and shifts... we're ideally placed." Silverstone is already used to teams using the circuit for private testing, away from prying eyes.
Pringle also made clear that everything had to be done so as not to put stress on policing or divert medical resources away from the fight against the coronavirus.
"I'm very clear we cannot be any sort of burden or the slightest impact on that. And if we are this isn't going to happen," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Silverstone boss Stuart Pringle warns British Grand Prix 'is not a given' even if it takes place behind closed doors as he urges F1 to make decision on race</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Silverstone managing director Stuart Pringle has warned that this year's British Grand Prix 'is not a given' even if it takes place without spectators.
The coronavirus pandemic has put Formula One's plans to start the season on hold but they are now lining up two races behind closed doors in Austria in early July before potentially two more at Silverstone to kickstart the campaign.
All potential races will need government approval which is further complicated by countries being at different stages of lockdown with restrictions on movement and mass events.
Pringle however maintained that Silverstone is keen to help the sport back on track but announced this week any race could only go ahead without spectators.
'The end of April (decision deadline) for us was if we had to start putting up temporary infrastructure for hospitality and dealing with the public and stuff,' Pringle said.
'We are only working on fixed infrastructure (now) so it's an awful lot less.
'I'm confident we could operate well within F1's decision-making cycle. I think they are the ones who have got to make the decision.'
The comments come after Formula One's managing director Ross Brawn outlined plans for the sport to resume in an isolated environment and create a 'kind of biosphere' at circuits.
'It's a real consideration because one of the logistical challenges is getting everyone tested and cleared to enter the paddock and enter the racing environment,' he said on the official F1 Nation podcast.
'And I think once we do that, it's very attractive to keep everyone in that environment, within that kind of biosphere that we want to create for another race.
'It's also pretty challenging to find the right sort of races early on where we can control the environment well enough.
'Austria fits that bill very well. It's got a local airport right next to the circuit, where people can charter planes into. It's not too close to a metropolis, it has a great infrastructure around it.
'There will be no motorhomes, but there will be a full catering facility laid on that the circuit has.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">British F1 race 'not a given', says Silverstone boss</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This year's British Grand Prix "is not a given" even without spectators and the decision depends on others, Silverstone managing director Stuart Pringle said on Saturday.
Formula One plans to start the season, put on hold by the COVID-19 pandemic, with two races behind closed doors in Austria in early July before potentially two more at Silverstone.
Any races will need government approval, with countries in various stages of lockdown with restrictions on movement and mass events.
Silverstone is keen to help the sport back on track but announced this week any race could only go ahead without spectators.
"The end of April (decision deadline) for us was if we had to start putting up temporary infrastructure for hospitality and dealing with the public and stuff," Pringle told Reuters.
"We are only working on fixed infrastructure (now) so it's an awful lot less.
"I'm confident we could operate well within F1's decision-making cycle," he said of any new deadline. "I think they are the ones who have got to make the decision."
Formula One's managing director Ross Brawn said the sport wanted to create a "kind of biosphere" at circuits.
That would involve getting everyone who entered the circuit tested and cleared for the coronavirus and then keeping them in a controlled environment.
"Austria fits that bill very well. It's got a local airport right next to the circuit, where people can charter planes into. It's not too close to a metropolis, it has a great infrastructure around it," Brawn told an F1 podcast.
"There will be no motorhomes, but there will be a full catering facility laid on that the circuit has."
HOME SECURITY
Formula One insiders have spoken of teams staying at secure hotels with no interaction with local residents and no media access.
Pringle said Silverstone, a home race for seven of the 10 teams, could offer security.
"In the discussions within sport, about restarting in the UK, there's been talk about the need for sites to be a bit like an island. To be controlled. We can achieve that," he said.
"We have all the facilities we need inside the circuit with the exception of a complete hotel. We have a half-built hotel, if that helps anyone.
Silverstone, a former World War Two airfield in central England, has a 222 hectare site with a nearly 8 km perimeter fence.
The Wing building is some 400 m long and can deliver 4,500 sit down lunches simultaneously with its own kitchens and five separate halls.
"We'd comfortably cater for everybody associated with putting it on," said Pringle. "We could separate people and shifts... we're ideally placed."
Silverstone is already used to teams using the circuit for private testing, away from prying eyes.
Pringle also made clear that everything had to be done so as not to put stress on policing or divert medical resources away from the fight against the coronavirus.
"I'm very clear we cannot be any sort of burden or the slightest impact on that. And if we are this isn't going to happen," he said.Moneycontrol Ready ReckonerNow that payment deadlines have been relaxed due to COVID-19, the Moneycontrol Ready Reckoner will help keep your date with insurance premiums, tax-saving investments and EMIs, among others.Download a copy

    <h5 class="mb-1">Spanish MotoGP rider Joan Mir adds two years to his contract at Suzuki</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS: Spanish MotoGP rider Joan Mir extended his contract with Suzuki until 2022, two weeks after team-mate and compatriot Alex Rins, the team announced on Saturday.
"The pairing provide a solid and competitive unit for Suzuki as they look towards the future and aim high in terms of results," said a team statement.
Rins, the Moto3 champion in 2017, made his debut in the premier class in 2019. His contract was due to end after this season.
The team statement said that in "pre-season tests he was showing fantastic form and pace."

The MotoGP season should have started in March but is on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Carmelo Ezpeleta, the CEO of promoter Dorna, said he is hoping for a resumption in late July "late July in Europe", presumably without spectators and with a limited number of people in the paddock.
"The current situation surrounding the Covid-19 crisis makes for a strange environment for both the team and the rider at the moment, with so much uncertainty in the air," said Suzuki, adding that the contract extension "proves the confidence" of the team "in their young rider".
Prior to Mir and Rins, six-time Spanish World Champion Marc Marquez extended his contract with Honda for another four years until the end of 2024.
Yamaha re-signed Spaniard Maverick Vinales for the 2021-2022 seasons, and announced the replacement of veteran Italian Valentino Rossi with Frenchman Fabio Quartararo from 2021.
For Rossi, who celebrated his 41st birthday on February 16, this announcement does not necessarily mean the end of his career.
"I'll have to decide without having competed in a single race. Anyway, I want to continue," said Rossi in an online interview last week.
"Imagine not racing this year. It would be fairer to race another season and stop after this one. So I'm hoping to continue in 2021," he said.
On Friday, Spaniard Tito Raba, the 2014 Moto2 cchampion prolonged his contract at Avintia until the end of 2021.

    <h5 class="mb-1">MotoGP news: Joan Mir completes Suzuki 2021 line-up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Suzuki has completed its rider line-up for the 2021 MotoGP season after re-signing Joan Mir on a new two-year deal.
The 2017 Moto3 world champion followed in the footsteps of Maverick Vinales in making his MotoGP debut with Suzuki last year following a single season in the Moto2 class.
Mir ended last year as the second-best rookie, finishing 12th in the standings with a best result of fifth at the Australian Grand Prix, although he battled with the after-effects of a violent crash during the post-race Brno test, which forced him out of the Austrian and British GPs.
Though he was one of the main targets for Ducati's 2021 line-up, Suzuki team boss Davide Brivio admitted to Autosport last month that everything had been agreed to retain Mir.
Taking to Instagram on Saturday morning, Mir confirmed he had penned a new agreement with Suzuki.
"I'm extremely happy to sign with Suzuki for another two years - renewing is the best thing that could happen and it's a dream come true again," Mir said.
"It's really important for me to continue because now I have more time to learn and more time to show my potential.
"Two years can go by quickly, but I am ready to arrive at a higher level, and we are working every day to make that happen.
"I am also so pleased on a personal level because I have a really good team and crew around me.
"I really want to thank everyone at Suzuki for their confidence in me, and let's see if I can get the results that we're capable of."
In a similar move, Alex Rins announced last month that he'd re-signed with Suzuki for two more years, and later admitted that discussions first began with the Japanese manufacturer last April.
Suzuki is the second manufacturer to firm up its 2021 line-up, after Yamaha confirmed Maverick Vinales and 2019's top rookie Fabio Quartararo on two-year deals.
Honda stunned the paddock in February when it announced it had secured reigning MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez for four more years on a deal rumoured to be worth €100 million.
The coronavirus-forced delay to the 2020 season has complicated the rider market situation, with many deals looking likely to be agreed before any racing has taken place.
Last month, Marquez suggested MotoGP introduce a freeze to rider contracts for 2021, while Petronas SRT boss Razlan Razali said his team would seek to retain Quartararo should 2020 be cancelled altogether.
After the Dutch, German and Finnish Grands Prix were cancelled, the season won't start until the end of July at the earliest, with MotoGP promoters Dorna Sports "optimistic" of getting the campaign underway by then.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Despite costing the Hammers a club-record £45m fee last summer, Haller has contributed just seven goals and one assist from 27 outings in the Premier League.
Although the Frenchman could be provided with more time to settle in London, The Express claims that West Ham are open to selling the 25-year-old.
Providing that the club remains in the Premier League, manager David Moyes is interested in reshaping his squad, as well as securing a deal for out-of-favour Chelsea frontman Michy Batshuayi.
The current financial climate may result in West Ham having to make a loss on Haller, although that may be deemed necessary for Moyes to bring in his preferred targets.
Haller still has just over four years left on his contract at the London Stadium.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chelsea transfer news: Shock bid for £75m Chelsea target, latest on £52m ace and Willian</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chelsea look to be busy in the summer transfer window with Frank Lampard keen to strengthen his squad in key areas in what is his first full summer transfer window as Blues boss. 
According to the Sun via Telefoot, Chelsea and Manchester United target Victor Osimhen of Lille is subject to a £75m bid from an unnamed club.
Chelsea were rumoured to be interested in the Lille striker who has been in fine form for the Ligue 1 side scoring 18 goals in all competitions this season, while Liverpool are also rumoured to be interested in signing him.
However, the Nigerian forward has over four years remaining on his contract with Lille so any move for the striker will command a substantial transfer fee as speculation about the identity of the unnamed club that sent in the bid continues.
Meanwhile, Chelsea winger Willian has been linked with a move to London rivals Arsenal or Tottenham, according to a report in the Metro.
The Brazilian winger’s contract with Chelsea expires in June and he is subject to interest from Spurs and Arsenal.
Speaking about his future, as cited in the Metro, Willian said:
“I don’t know. I like London and so does my family.”
“However, this is a question that I still don’t know the answer, if I will stay at Chelsea, move to another team from London, or leave England.”
Elsewhere, Chelsea and Liverpool target Timo Werner has said that he prefers a new challenge in a foreign league, according to a report in the Metro. 
This comes shortly after news of Chelsea being handed a boost in their pursuit of Werner, with Liverpool reportedly cooling their interest in the Leipzig striker because of the financial impact of the coronavirus on the Anfield club.
According to the Metro report speaking to Bild, the striker said: 
“A challenge in a foreign league would appeal to me rather than a move to Bayern.”
Chelsea are reportedly in for Werner who has a £52m release clause, according to the Metro report and this could pave the way for a transfer to Stamford Bridge with Liverpool poised to back out of any deal for the Leipzig forward.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 25-year-old has yet to make a single competitive appearance for the Blues in six years with the club.
Pasalic has instead spent the past six seasons out on loan with five different clubs in five different countries, including the past two seasons with Atalanta BC.
However, the Croatia international's spell in Italy is close to coming to an end and it is uncertain whether Atalanta will take up the option to sign him permanently.
According to football.london, Chelsea now face a decision as to whether to finally give Pasalic a chance to prove himself.
Pasalic is under contract at Stamford Bridge for another two years, having signed his latest contract extension last summer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tommy Wright leaves St Johnstone after seven years as manager</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tommy Wright has stepped down as manager of St Johnstone after spending nine years with the Scottish Premiership club.
Wright arrived in Perth in 2011 as assistant manager to Steve Lomas and then took over in the hot seat when his fellow Northern Irishman left for Millwall in June 2013.
He led Saints to their first-ever Scottish Cup success in 2014 and guided the club into the top six of Scotland's top division in his first four seasons in charge.
St Johnstone reached the Europa League qualifying rounds on four occasions under Wright but could not make the group stages.
A club statement read: "Although Tommy still has a further two years of his contract to run, planning has been ongoing for some time between the board and Tommy in respect of the footballing side of the club.
"We all feel that we have been successful in creating a young and exciting squad and the club is well positioned for the future. Having been at the club for almost nine years, Tommy feels this would also be the most suitable time to allow him to take a well-earned break.
"The board will now have the unenviable task of finding a replacement for Tommy once the COVID-19 situation in respect of football is clarified."
Wright added: "I want to take the opportunity to say that the support I have had from the fans has been incredible and contributed immensely to my experience with the club.
"So, to the club, its staff, players and fans - I'll always hold a very special place for you all and I look forward to coming back to McDiarmid Park - I am so proud of what we have achieved together. We have an exciting group of young players and I look forward to seeing their progression with you all."
Wright says the decision to part company had been discussed privately as far back as two seasons ago and that he is ultimately proud of his achievements at the club.
He is also confident he is leaving behind a squad capable of consolidating and improving in future seasons under a new manager.
Speaking to Saints TV, Wright added: "It was extremely difficult, obviously being at the club so long I've got a lot of feelings for the club, lots and lots of happy memories and worked with a lot of good people both on the pitch and off the pitch.
"It was something that was being considered for a while, even as far back as at the end of the season when we finished eighth (in 2017-18).
"We sort of made a decision to see if over the next couple of years we could bring the age of the squad down and it might be time for me to move on. Fortunately, we have done that. There have been two good seasons.
"It's been something that I felt that when you are at a club for a long period of time, sometimes there comes a point where you need a break and I do need a break.
"It's a tough job. People don't give you sympathy being in football management, but it's 365 days and 24 hours a day and I just felt that this season, if we did well, it would have been the perfect time for me to leave the club in a really strong position.
"Hopefully, I think it can be a top-six side and in a really good position. It hasn't been an easy decision but I think it is the right time."

Wright said in a statement on St Johnstone's official website: "I've had a fantastic journey with the club and I would like to personally thank Steve, Stan and Charlie for their continued support during my time as manager.
"I would also like to thank all the staff and players that have been on this journey during my time at the club.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Newcastle player could be set for Northern Ireland job</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ST JOHNSTONE announced on Saturday that manager Tommy Wright has parted company with the club after a highly successful seven-year stay.
Wright joined the Scottish Premiership side in November 2011 as assistant manager before taking the hot seat in June 2013.
The Northern Irishman led the Saints to their first-ever Scottish Cup success in 2014 and guided the Perth side to several top-six finishes.
St Johnstone reached the Europa League qualifying rounds on four occasions under Wright but could not make the group stages.
The 56-year-old had two years left on his contract, but has been strongly linked with the vacant position of Northern Ireland boss.
Michael O’Neill stepped down as Northern Ireland manager last month to focus on his role in charge of Stoke after the coronavirus outbreak ruined his plan to remain in charge for the European Championship playoffs.
“To the club, its staff, players and fans, I’ll always hold a very special place for you all and I look forward to coming back to McDiarmid Park. I am so proud of what we have achieved together,” said Wright in a statement.
“We have an exciting group of young players and I look forward to seeing their progression with you all.”
St Johnstone said they had planned for the change of manager at the end of the season and the timing of the move is a further indication that Scottish clubs are not expecting to restart the campaign.
A controversial resolution to end the lower leagues has already been passed by the 42 members clubs and the same proposal allows the Scottish Professional Leagues Board (SPFL) to end the Premiership season if it deems that the games cannot be played due to the coronavirus pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">St Johnstone announce shock departure of long-serving boss Tommy Wright</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ST JOHNSTONE have announced the shock departure of long-serving boss Tommy Wright.
The Northern Irishman joined the Perth side in November 2011 as an assistant boss before making the step up to manager in June 2013.
During his spell in charge he achieved an unforgettable Scottish Cup win in May 2014, multiple top six finishes and guided the club into Europe.
The 56-year-old, who had two years of his contract left to run, says the decision to leave his role was not taken lightly and that discussions over his position started long before the coronavirus pandemic.
On his departure from McDiarmid Park, he told the Saints' official website: "I’ve had a fantastic journey with the club and I would like to personally thank Steve, Stan and Charlie for their continued support during my time as manager.
"I would also like to thank all the staff and players that have been on this journey during my time at the club.
"Finally, I want to take the opportunity to say that the support I have had from the fans has been incredible and contributed immensely to my experience with the club.
"So, to the club, its staff, players and fans – I’ll always hold a very special place for you all and I look forward to coming back to McDiarmid Park – I am so proud of what we have achieved together.
"We have an exciting group of young players and I look forward to seeing their progression with you all."
The Saints board will now face a tough task of replacing Wright.
St Johnstone were sitting in seventh spot in the Premiership table before football was halted due to Covid-19.
A club statement on Wright's departure read: "The board of St Johnstone FC and their longstanding and much valued manager, Tommy Wright, wish to make an important announcement in respect of their future plans for the management and coaching of the playing side of the club from now until the end of the season and beyond.
"Although Tommy still has a further two years of his contract to run, planning has been ongoing for some time between the board and Tommy in respect of the footballing side of the Club.
"We all feel that we have been successful in creating a young and exciting squad and the club is well positioned for the future.
"Having been at the club for almost nine years, Tommy feels this would also be the most suitable time to allow him to take a well-earned break.
"Tommy joined the club in November 2011 as assistant manager and made the step up to manager in June 2013.
"Tommy has enjoyed unprecedented success at the club, attaining multiple top six finishes, European forays and an unforgettable Scottish Cup win in May 2014.
"The board will now have the unenviable task of finding a replacement for Tommy once the COVID-19 situation in respect of football is clarified.
"Having considered the possibility of Tommy leaving his position as manager at the end of the season, it was felt by both the board and Tommy that during the current lockdown, now would be an appropriate time.
"The chairman, the board and Tommy will continue to remain in contact and on the best of terms, and Tommy will be most welcome at any time at the club where he enjoyed so many joyous and successful times.
"It goes without saying that the board would like to thank Tommy for his hard-work, dedication and commitment to the club and wish him and Anne every success in the future."
Fans paid tribute to their former boss on social media following the breaking news.
One wrote: "Best of luck Tommy, what a great hob you have done at Saints all the best."
Another said: "Gutted. What a guy!! Certainly is the end of an era."
A further Saints fan added: "Absolutely gutted to see King Tommy leave but the legacy and memories he leaves behind can never be taken away from us. What an amazing job he's done - best of luck to him whatever comes next."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Here, the PA news agency looks at the challenges which will be facing him.
An action plan needs to be drawn up – quickly. Leading unions are going to see massive drops in revenue of tens of millions of pounds. Tier two countries will also be seeking support. International rugby this summer is looking unlikely and a workable plan needs to be in place ahead of the November internationals. World Rugby is already looking at the finances of all tier one nations and has promised to help those in trouble. But the Test calendar, which generates the bulk of the sport's revenue, needs sorting. It seems a long time ago now, but the Six Nations has still to be completed.
A topic that is not going to go away, and one that is not just a burning issue for rugby union. The first issue to sort regarding safety is not even rugby-related – players and staff will need to be reassured that the necessary precautions are in place regarding Covid-19. Once that battle is won, attention will again turn to the long-term effects of playing rugby especially around concussion. World Rugby has launched a scheme called Activate – describing it as a "game-changer" –  following research co-led by England Rugby and the University of Bath. It is claimed the exercise programme can reduce the risk of soft-tissue injuries by 26 and 40 per cent and concussion risk by 29 and 60 per cent in youth and adult rugby players, respectively. But more still needs to be done in this field.
Allegations of unethical governance in the sport's unions have led to reports that rugby union could be blocked from the Olympics. There is also frustration by southern hemisphere countries and many tier two unions that the Six Nations unions are too dominant – currently tier one nations have three votes each in elections.  
Beaumont has been vociferous in his support for the women's game, speaking of the importance in his manifesto – as did Agustin Pichot. Although World Rugby has increased female representation on its Council, there are no women standing for a position on the executive committee. With drops in revenue expected for all sports due to the coronavirus pandemic, fears have been expressed that women's sport could suffer as a consequence and Beaumont will want to ensure that does not happen in rugby union.

Beaumont has been vociferous in his support for the women’s game, speaking of the importance in his manifesto – as did Agustin Pichot. Although World Rugby has increased female representation on its Council, there are no women standing for a position on the executive committee. With drops in revenue expected for all sports due to the coronavirus pandemic, fears have been expressed that women’s sport could suffer as a consequence and Beaumont will want to ensure that does not happen in rugby union.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Expect Kohli, Rohit to groom youngsters like Dhoni did: Gambhir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir expects current captain Virat Kohli and his deputy in limited-overs Rohit Sharma to groom talented youngsters coming into the squad in the manner former skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni used to do during his time at the helm.
Citing an example of Rohit, Gambhir stated that Dhoni believed in his abilities despite him being in and out of the team and that MSD's backing ultimately led to him becoming one of the best white-ball cricketers in the world.
"The young cricketers in the current generation today, be it Shubman Gill or Sanju Samson, should also get similar kind of support," Gambhir told Sports Tak.
"And now when Rohit is a senior, I expect him to give backing to youngsters. Rohit is a prime example of how a player can become a phenomenal cricketer, if he has good backing.

"One good thing about MS (Dhoni) was that he always kept Rohit in the talks, even if he was not part of the team. He never let him get sidelined," he added.
"I expect Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to groom the youngsters in the same way in which MS Dhoni groomed them."
After making this debut in 2007, Rohit was languishing in the middle-order with consistency being his Achilles heel. Dhoni seemingly took note of Rohit's hidden talent and gave him a long rope. He then promoted Rohit as opener in 2013 and the right-hander hasn't looked back since.

Pant was heir apparent to Dhoni until K L Rahul emerged as a wicket-keeper batsman in the limited-overs format, making the southpaw no more a certainty in the playing eleven.
"He (Dhoni) has been like a mentor to me, on and off the field. I can approach him freely with any problem I may be facing, and he will never give me the entire solution for it," Pant said in an Instagram live session with his IPL team Delhi Capitals.
"This is so that I don't become entirely dependent on him, he gives me hints only that helps me solve the issue myself. He's also one of my favourite batting partners, though it's not something that happens too often.
"If Mahi bhai is at the crease, you know things are sorted. He's got a plan in his head, and all you need to do is follow it!"
Dhoni, who has not played competitive cricket since July, was supposed to make a much-awaited comeback with the IPL, which has now been postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh thinks Dhoni has already played his last game for the country.

Ponting gives me full freedom at Delhi Capitals: PantRishabh Pant's propensity to go for the jugular at the outset has often led to his downfall, but his IPL franchise Delhi Capitals' coach Ricky Ponting still allows him freedom to do "whatever" he wants to.
"He gives me a free hand. He says do whatever you want to do," Pant said during an Instagram chat with his franchise.
He also called the IPL 2018 season a "life-changing" one for him.
Pant had scored over 650 runs in 14 matches in that IPL at 52.61 and a strike rate of 158.41 with six half centuries.
"That was a life-changing season for me. I needed that breakthrough which everyone needs," he said.
"The core group always thinks of winning IPL for Delhi. We qualified for the knockouts last time and came third."He also spoke about the challenges of playing Test cricket.
"I love playing Tests. You can give yourself time. Mostly you can test yourself in Test cricket. When I was playing four-day first-class games, I had heard it is the real test but when I played five-day cricket... it was like you need to put in that extra effort."The 22-year-old was picked ahead of veteran stumper Wriddhiman Saha in the two Tests which India lost 0-2 in New Zealand.
Recalling his early days of struggle, the Roorkee-born Pant said he used to take a bus at 2 o'clock in the night to travel to Delhi for practice.
"They (Uttarakhand) did not have a cricket team at that point. So I used to take bus at 2 am in the night. That time it used to take six hours by road. It was difficult during winters as it was too cold. There was fog also. It's been a good journey (as I look back).
"At the end of the day, you have to work hard to achieve your goal," said Pant who has played 13 Tests, 16 ODIs and 28 T20Is so far.
Pant said that seniors such as MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan help him a lot along with former stars Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina.
Speaking about his idol Adam Gilchrist, Pant said: "Over a period of time I have realised that you have to learn from your idol but you don't have to copy him. You learn things which you like and can implement in life and cricket. You need to have your own identity.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ishant Sharma shares a great deal of respect for MS Dhoni, especially for the backing the former Indian skipper had for him for the first six years of his career. Ishant reciprocated that belief with some best years under Virat Kohli in Test cricket. However, funnily enough, as the pacer revealed a tale from last year’s IPL, there was a moment of chirpiness.
“In last year’s IPL match against Chennai Super Kings, Mahi Bhai used to tell me a lot that you can’t hit sixes. So when I hit Jaddu for a six and a four in two balls, the first thing that I did was look back at Mahi Bhai. After that, Mahi Bhai was so angry at Jaddu and scolded him a lot. (Laughs). Batting was feeling like a king. It is a labour-like feeling in bowling. You know batting is fun,” Ishant told Gaurav Kapur in an episode of Isolation Premier League.
Ishant was picked by Delhi Capitals and instantly became a force to be reckoned with and a guide to many talented pacers in the set-up. That resulted in the team breaking their slump to qualify for the play-offs for the first time in eight years under the leadership of Shreyas Iyer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Was comparing him to McGrath, Akram: Razzaq on calling Bumrah ‘baby bowler’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq has made a name for himself for making controversial statements. He courted controversy last year when he called Jasprit Bumrah a “baby bowler” in comparison to the fast bowlers of his times.
Bumrah today is the world’s premier fast bowler across all formats and Razzaq believes the Indian is on his way to becoming a world class bowler. Razzaq said his statement was misconstrued but maintained that the quality of bowlers when he played was far superior.

“I do not have anything personal against Bumrah. I was simply comparing him with the likes of Glenn McGrath, Wasim Akram, Curtly Ambrose, Shoaib Akhtar. It would have been much tougher to face them. My comments were misconstrued.
“He is heading towards becoming a world-class bowler. But in our times, the bowlers were of much higher calibre. Not many can dispute that,” Razzaq told Press Trust of India.
He also believes that the standard of cricket has fallen now and blamed too much of T20 cricket for this impact.
“You don’t feel the same pressure facing the current crop of pacers. Overall, there is a bad patch in world cricket. We are not producing world class players the way we used to 10-15 years ago.
“You had Tendulkar, Zaheer, Sehwag, Ganguly in the same team. They would have walked into any team. May be too much T20 cricket is responsible for this decline,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">When MS Dhoni is on field, everything feels sorted: Rishabh Pant</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rishabh Pant has said that former India skipper and his predecessor MS Dhoni is like a mentor to him and he seeks his guidance, both on and off the field.
MS Dhoni has not played any cricket since India's semi-final exit from the World Cup 2019, following which Pant took over the keeping duties in limited-overs format until KL Rahul emerged as India's new multi-tasker.
In an Instagram live session for Delhi Capitals, Pant revealed that he tries to pick Dhoni's brain.
"He is like a mentor to me. He helps me on and off the field. He gives me hints and tries that I figure things out myself so that I do not become dependent on him but he also does not just back off from it," Pant said during the session.
In recent months, Pant has come under immense scrutiny-both in front of and behind the stumps. The 22-year-old has faced a lot of criticism for his injudicious shots during critical situations during a match. There have also been situations when spectators have chanted Dhoni's name when Pant missed chances on the field.
"Although my favourite batting partner is Mahi Bhai, we get very few chances to bat together. When Mahi Bhai is there, everything feels sorted out as you just have to follow his plan," he said.
"There is Virat, Rohit, whenever you bat alongside seniors, it is a different experience," Pant added.
Though Pant has been under the spotlight since long, the team management and senior players have also backed the wicketkeeper-batsman.
Recently, India opener Rohit Sharma looked unimpressed with how Rishabh Pant's performances in the past have been analyzed by the media.
"I talk to Rishabh Pant more, he is just 20-21, he was under so much of scrutiny that he got tensed."
"Media thinks its part of their job to write but they should be sensible and think before writing something as it plays a huge part," Rohit Sharma said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India batter Smriti Mandhana recalled an instance when her thigh was left swollen by a quick delivery from fast bowler Mohammed Shami. Mandhana, while speaking to India vice-captain Rohit Sharma and teammate Jemimah Rodrigues during a live chat, revealed how Shami’s pace was too much for her and it left the batter black and blue.

“I remember playing Shami bhaiya (Mohammed Shami) when his doing his rehab. He was bowling at a 120 waala pace (mph) to me and promised that he wouldn’t bowl on my body,” Mandhana said in the video shared by Baseline Ventures on YouTube. “I was beaten for the first two balls as I was not used to the pace. On the third ball, his in-dipper hit me on my inner thigh and it turned black, blue, and green and was swollen for 10 days.” Also Read - Gautam Gambhir Hails Rohit Sharma as 'Best White Ball Cricketer' on His 33rd Birthday
Rohit weighed in on the topic, mentioning Shami and Jasprit Bumrah are perhaps the toughest to face in the nets and how both pacers always licks their chops whenever he spots a spicy wicket to bowl on. Also Read - Happy Birthday Rohit Sharma: Wishes Pour in as 'Hitman' Turns 33
“The pitches we have for net sessions are almost always green with moisture. And whenever Shami sees a green pitch, he eats extra biryani! Bumrah is also difficult but he has been around only for two-three years,” he pointed out.
“Shami, I have been playing since 2013. But yeah, right now there must be a competition going on between Bumrah and Shami, on who beats the bat most, who can hit the most on the helmets.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Juventus chief warns Paul Pogba over Man Utd exit and makes Ronaldo comparison</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Juventus Chief Football Officer Fabio Paratici has discussed the Italian champions’ interest in Manchester United star Paul Pogba but admits the club will not be able to spend big this summer and has warned him not to expect a massive pay day.
The French midfielder is out of contract in the summer of 2021 – though United have the option to trigger a one-year extension – and has been stalling over renewal talks, with his agent, Mino Raiola, clashing with the club’s hierarchy and manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
Fearful of losing Pogba on the cheap and wary of their increasingly strained relationship, United are believed to be open to selling the World Cup winner if they receive a sum close to the £89m they paid four years ago.
Both Real Madrid and old club Juve have been heavily linked with Pogba, though the changing financial landscape due to the coronavirus crisis has considerably altered the European giants’ spending power.
It has instead been suggested that Juve will look to trade players this summer – with Miralem Pjanic and Douglas Costa among the first-team stars who could be swapped – and Paratici confirmed that approach on Sunday, while he also warned Pogba to forget about earning an astronomical salary.
Speaking to Sky Sport Italia, he said: ‘Paul Pogba is a fantastic player, we know him as a champion.
‘But something will change after the coronavirus crisis, because logically the salary demands someone at his level would have had before is now more difficult to get hold of. Or, at least, he’ll have fewer clubs prepared to pay that money.’
On why Pogba cannot hope to be handed a similar salary to Cristiano Ronaldo, he added: ‘Cristiano is a different player to all the others. He brings incredible and exponential growth in revenue, representing a brand that is almost as big as a club.’
Speaking about how clubs’ transfer strategies will need to change, he continued: ‘Clubs will certainly have some more difficulties to deal with, so with less income, we’ll need to be more creative and elastic, finding a different formula for transfer deals. I expect many exchanges of players, although obviously we can’t use the NBA draft because that is a closed system.
‘We should take more from the NBA and American sports in general. After all, the Premier League has this big advantage over the other leagues because they control the brand and represent the whole league rather than individual clubs.
‘What we will see is more extended loans, so a two-year loan, even three. Some say we could start the 2020-21 season with the same players as 2019-20, which is also a possibility.
‘There will certainly be less cash circulating and that’s obvious to everyone. We are going through a difficult moment globally, not just in football, and the consequences will be felt everywhere. Therefore, I think we’ll see longer loans because rather than purchase homes, people are more likely in a time of uncertainty to rent.
‘I believe that if we exchange players between the top 12-15 clubs in the world, the value of the transfers won’t drop. When purchasing a new player, that’s a different matter and we can see a fall in the fees.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Liverpool linked with move for Napoli star Kalidou Koulibaly; tipped to beat Manchester United</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Liverpool have strangely been linked with a move for Napoli superstar defender Kalidou Koulibaly, even though uncertainty surrounds the financial positions of football clubs because of the ongoing pandemic.
Manchester United are said to be interested in the Senegalese stalwart, but the Reds have reportedly moved ahead of the Red Devils in the queue for the centre-half.
That’s according to Tuttomercatoweb, who – without any legitimate basis – say Jurgen Klopp could look to offload Joel Matip and replace him with Koulibaly.
While this deal would make sense on Football Manager, it’s not realistic. The coronavirus pandemic has thrown question marks over the financial positions of every football club in the world.

Koulibaly would cost potential suitors around £60million, and there is very little chance anyone would be willing to sanction that fee in the current climate.
Whether the Reds are interested in the centre-back is another thing, but we’d urge supporters to be extra cautious of rumours – at least until the financial impact of COVID-19 is realised.
Besides, Joe Gomez and Joel Matip are more than good enough to start alongside Virgil van Dijk!

According to Spanish news media outlet Mundo Deportivo, the 27-year-old would join the Magpies if the Argentine boss is hired.
Man United legend urges club to sign Super Eagles star and it is not Osimhen
Coutinho is currently one of the hottest players in the transfer market after failing to justify his £142million move from Liverpool to Barcelona in 2018.
The Brazilian is presently on a season-long loan move to Bayern Munich despite his nine goals and nine assists, the Bavarians are unwilling to make his deal permanent.
Barcelona are looking to offload Coutinho off their books in the summer and Chelsea are the club leading the race for the Inter Milan star.
But Newcastle are the latest club to have penned their interest in the Brazilian and the only hurdle of landing Coutinho at the club is hiring Pochettino.
Reports claim that Barca have reportedly placed around £80m price tag on Coutinho which Chelsea are not prepared to meet.
Coutinho managed 21 goals and 11 assists in 76 matches for Barca, against his 54 goals in 201 appearances for Liverpool.

Meanwhile, Legit.ng had earlier reported that Philippe Coutinho would have to be bought by £87million this summer, according to reports from Spain.
Chelsea are at the forefront of the deal as Barcelona look set to offload the Brazilian international.
Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham have also been linked to him, but Liverpool have rejected the chance to take him back.
According to Spanish news outlet Mundo Deportivo, the 27-year-old will only be priced away from Camp Nou for £87m.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Talks held: Liverpool begin discussions over transfer for star whose €100million price tag has fallen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Liverpool have reportedly made first contact over a potential transfer move for Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly.
The Senegal international has long been linked with a move to a top club after shining in Serie A, and it looks like Liverpool are the latest to show a strong interest.
According to Tuttomercatoweb, the Reds have begin discussions over a possible deal, with Napoli seemingly willing to sell and with the player’s previous asking price of €100million falling amid the coronavirus crisis.
Liverpool fans will hope this means their club can pounce and team Koulibaly up with Virgil van Dijk in central defence.
This would surely give Jurgen Klopp’s side the best central defensive pairing on the planet, as the duo are already arguably the top two players in the world in that position.
Liverpool already have a world class squad, and the addition of Koulibaly would surely cement their status as a dominant force in the Premier League and Europe.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jack Grealish transfer latest: Aston Villa star's hint, Man Utd final decision, £70m warning</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish continues to be linked with a move away from Villa Park.
Grealish has been in stunning form this season with nine goals and eight assists in all competitions.
The 24-year-old, who is under contract until 2023, has most heavily been linked with Manchester United while the likes of Everton and Chelsea are also said to be interested.
Here's the latest and what's been said:
Grealish is now reportedly Manchester United's top midfield transfer target heading into the summer window.
The 24-year-old is being heavily linked with a £70m switch to Old Trafford having excelled on the Premier League stage.
And, according to the MEN, United's preference is to sign Grealish over Leicester City star James Maddison.

Greal has revealed he used to wear the number seven shirt growing up after being inspired by United hero Cristiano Ronaldo.
During a Q&A session on Instagram, Grealish was asked which shirt number he'd wear if he wasn't number 10. He said: "I used to love seven growing up because of Cristiano."
No one has been able to adequately fill United's most iconic shirt number since the Portuguese superstar left for Real Madrid in 2009.

United could be forced to put their pursuit of Grealish on hold, Ed Woodward has warned.
The executive vice-chairman admits any lavish spending plans might need to be shelved as clubs count the cost of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Speaking at a fan forum event on Friday, Woodward said: “Nobody should be under any illusions about the scale of challenge facing everyone in football and it may not be ‘business as usual’ for any clubs, including ourselves, in the transfer market this summer.
“As ever our priority is the success of the team, but we need visibility of the impact across the whole industry, including timings of the transfer window, and the wider financial picture, before we can talk about a return to normality."

The transfer speculation surrounding Grealish continues to grow, despite the suspension of English football.
Fellow Premier League outfit Everton have been credited with an interest in Grealish’s services, and now a fresh report has emerged.
According to a report by Football Insider, quoted by the Daily Star, the Toffees are “secretly confident” of signing Grealish this summer.
More HERE.
Chelsea have also been linked with Grealish.
Frank Lampard's side are on course to finish in the top four of the Premier League, when it does eventually restart and would be in a position to offer Grealish Champions League football next season.
Italian website Calciomercato say Chelsea are ready to rival United in the summer.
More HERE.
Manchester City will not pursue a move for Grealish this summer, according to reports.
Pep Guardiola has heaped public praise on the Villa skipper throughout the season, singling him out in pre-match press conferences.
However, the Manchester Evening News’ City correspondent Simon Bajikowski has explained why he isn't on the club's wishlist. Tottenham are also being linked.
More HERE.
Conor Hourihane says Grealish is 'too good' for Villa's current team and backed the England hopeful to earn a move away from Villa Park.
"He's top, top class. In terms of pure ability and sheer skill and technique level he's easily the best player I've played with to date," Hourihane told the Southern Star's podcast.
"He's developed over the three years I've been here - he's taken his game to a new level - especially this year in the Premier League.
"He's taken it by storm really. You know, England team and getting that big move is only a matter of time because, if I'm being brutally honest, he's too good for our team at Aston Villa."
More HERE.
Grealish has made such an impression on Jamie Carragher that the Liverpool legend has picked the Villa captain in his Premier League team of the season.
Carragher also said he has no doubt the 24-year-old would take a move to Old Trafford - or to any top club - in his stride.
The former defender said: "Who knows how the season is going to end up and whether Villa go down or not, but there's no doubt he's got the quality to play for one of the top clubs in the Premier League or Europe."
More HERE.
Villa chief executive Christian Purslow, back in November, is quoted as saying by the Daily Mail : "We can say no. We do have a number of wonderful players. It's a big compliment that we have brilliant players that attract the attention of lots of clubs around Europe.
"I'm absolutely proud to say these boys love playing for Aston Villa and we are a club these days who don't have to worry about selling our assets to survive. We are in a different situation now.
"We have a team of very young players with great international futures ahead of them and that is the most important thing for the financial and footballing health of a club - that you have players that are assets, who are improving all the time and whose values are improving.
"That gives you the flexibility summer to summer to look at those players and sometimes sell players and then go again.
"We, like every club in the Premier League, may have to do that in future but the important thing is to have a collection of really valuable assets and we do."
Man United hero Rio Ferdinand blasted a fan of his old side who rang into radio station talkSPORT and claimed Grealish wouldn't move to the club in the summer.
One United fan rang talkSPORT to claim Grealish and fellow playmaker James Maddison, at Leicester City, are too good for United.
Ferdinand took to social media to brand the caller a 'loon'.
He tweeted : "What am I hearing from the caller on @talkSPORT...he doesn’t think @JackGrealish would leave Villa for United! #loon."
Villa legend Paul McGrath says there is 'no chance' of Grealish moving to United when the window opens.
McGrath revealed he doesn't think the playmaker will make the move as he conducted a Q&A on Instagram.
The former Villa hero, who joined from the club from United, addressed the speculation by saying: "No chance".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Philippe Coutinho's Premier League return could hinge on Mauricio Pochettino decision</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Philippe Coutinho's hopes of a return to the Premier League may rely on whether Mauricio Pochettino takes over at Newcastle United under prospective new owners.
Current Magpies owner Mike Ashley is set to sell the club amid heavy interest from Saudi and American parties, both of whom have made the former Tottenham Hotspur coach their priority managerial target.
Meanwhile, Coutinho looks destined to leave Camp Nou this summer after spending this season on loan with Bayern Munich.
The Brazilian playmaker's agent said last month that his client "would love" a return to the Premier League, escalating speculation linking Coutinho with a move to Chelsea.
However, the Blues are unwilling to meet Barcelona's £87m asking price for the 27-year-old and Newcastle have emerged as a suitor thanks to Pochettino's admiration for the former Liverpool man.
Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo report that a previous approach for Coutinho by Pochettino was blocked by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy and that the Argentinian coach could swoop again.
"Pochettino already tried last summer to sign Coutinho for Tottenham and if he did not succeed it was because of President Levy's irreparable enmity with the Brazilian's agent," the report claims.
"Now, without personal issues involved, Coutinho could reach a club for which, in recent months, [Antoine] Griezmann has also sounded."
A marquee signing of Coutinho or Griezmann at St James' Park would be a statement of intent for a Newcastle under new ownership.
The report adds that Pochettino "would become the leader of a project, such as the one in which Manchester City began, and who wants to place Newcastle in the super elite of football".
Pochettino is currently odds-on favourite to take over at Newcastle from current manager Steve Bruce. The Magpies are currently 13th in the Premier League and have scored just 25 goals in 29 games this season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Miss hitting the ball, can't wait to go out & play: Rohit Sharma</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mumbai: Prolific India opener Rohit Sharma is badly missing hitting the cricket ball and can’t wait to go out and start playing again once the lockdown ends amid the coronavirus pandemic.
In normal circumstances, Rohit would have been currently leading Mumbai Indians in the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League which now stands indefinitely postponed.
“I wish I had enough place to play indoor cricket, but unfortunately in Mumbai, the place is very secluded, and you have to stick to your apartment. We are not lucky as you guys where you have your own backyard to play,” Rohit said while speaking to former Australian pacer Brett Lee on Star Sports Cricket Connected show.
“In Mumbai, it’s very expensive to get your own house where you have your own backyard. I live in an apartment and I am lucky to have a little balcony where I can run around and do some activities that my trainer has given me.
“I am trying to follow whatever little I can. Hopefully, the gyms will open soon, and I can go there,” he added.
“But I am missing hitting the ball, that’s for sure. As you know, I like to hit big, so the space is not enough. I just can’t wait to go out there and start hitting the ball,” Rohit, who recently turned 33, further said.
All sporting activities have been suspended since mid March following the coronavirus outbreak which has so far claimed more than 2.3 lakh lives across the world. And the chances of cricketing activities resuming in the near future are highly grim.
In India, nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24. It was first slated to end on April 14 but then it was extended till May 3. It has now been further extended till May 17 as the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases refuses to slow down.

All sporting activities have been suspended since mid March following the coronavirus outbreak.
In India, nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24. It was first slated to end on April 14 but then it was extended till May 3. It has now been further extended till May 17 as the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases refuses to slow down.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Can't wait to go out there and start hitting the ball: Rohit Sharma misses cricket during Covid-19 lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India opener Rohit Sharma on Saturday said that he is badly missing hitting the ball amid the coronavirus lockdown and can't wait to go out and enjoy the game.
Cricket like many other sports has been hit hard by the novel coronavirus as almost all leagues and series have either been cancelled or postponed due to the health crisis.
Rohit Sharma, who is the captain of Mumbai Indians, is currently in isolation with his wife and daughter in his flat in Mumbai and wished he had enough place to play indoor cricket.
"I wish I had enough place to play indoor cricket, but unfortunately in Mumbai, the place is very secluded, and you have to stick to your apartment. We are not lucky as you guys where you have your own backyard to play," Rohit said while speaking to former Australian pacer Brett Lee on Star Sports Cricket Connected show.
"In Mumbai, it's very expensive to get your own house where you have your own backyard. I live in an apartment and I am lucky to have a little balcony where I can run around and do some activities that my trainer has given me.
Rohit Sharma, who turned 33 on Thursday, said he is trying to maintain his fitness in the little space he has and hopes that the gyms will open soon.
"I am trying to follow whatever little I can. Hopefully, the gyms will open soon, and I can go there," he added.
"But I am missing hitting the ball, that's for sure. As you know, I like to hit big, so the space is not enough. I just can't wait to go out there and start hitting the ball," Rohit said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sky Sports pundit says Arsenal-linked 27-goal striker would be ‘mouth-watering’ at Spurs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sky Sports pundit Kris Boyd believes that reported Arsenal target Odsonne Edouard would also be a “great fit” for Tottenham Hotspur and a “mouth-watering” prospect for Spurs fans alongside Harry Kane (The Scottish Sun).
According to The Mirror, the Gunners are interested in the highly rated Celtic striker, who has claimed an impressive 60 goals and 31 assists in 126 Hoops appearances.
Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta reportedly plans to bolster his ranks this summer amid an uncertain future for the club’s main frontmen, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette – but talkSPORT claims Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham are also keen on the 22-year-old.
Edouard has played for Celtic since the summer of 2017, when he initially joined on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, and joined the Bhoys permanently the following year for a club record £9million (Sky Sports).
This season alone, the Frenchman has 27 goals and 19 assists from 45 games in all competitions, showing he’s not only a clinical, prolific goal machine but also a selfless provider for his teammates.
“I honestly believe Edouard could go all the way,” Boyd wrote in the Scottish Sun. “There’s no doubt he could walk into the Arsenal team – and their North London rivals Tottenham would also be a great fit for him.
“He’s linked superbly with Leigh Griffiths during their time together in Glasgow, so the prospect of him playing alongside Harry Kane would be a mouth-watering one for Spurs fans.
“Edouard has everything you want in a modern striker. Whether he leaves Celtic this summer is down to him. If he wants to find fame and fortune in England then the Parkhead club will soon be eyeing a replacement.”
Celtic’s record signing has been nothing short of sensational since arriving at Parkhead and his £9million fee seems a snip now, but surely it’s now only a matter of time before he ups sticks and heads to one of Europe’s elite clubs.
Edouard is a player of the highest calibre who continues to receive plaudits and is destined for a big move – whether south of the border or to another top European league.
Both Arsenal and Tottenham could be in the market for strikers – the Gunners are sweating over the futures of Aubameyang and Lacazette, while Spurs will not want to find themselves without a recognised senior striker at their disposal again after earlier this year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Arsenal warned that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang 'could walk out the door'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Arsenal should be wary of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang "walking out the door".
The Gunners frontman is entering the final 12 months of his deal at the Emirates.
Since arriving from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018 he has become crucial to the north London outfit.
But with Arsenal someway off challenging for trophies former captain Tony Adams fears Aubameyang could take his talents elsewhere with Chelsea and Barcelona among those interested.
“Quite possibly, he could walk out the door,” Adams told Sky Sports.
“I loved [former manager] Arsene Wenger's principles, that no player was bigger than the club, and he moved players on if it made sense for the club financially.
“He was strong with that and he got Champions League football every year but it did stand in the way of recruitment - so we have become a club that is selling the best players.
“If I was a coach I'd be saying: ‘Don't sell Aubameyang at any price, we need to recruit, bring players through the academy and keep our best players.’”
Adams won the league title on four occasions during his Arsenal career as well as the FA Cup and League Cup.

He revealed that Manchester United made a move for him, before he was given assurances that the Gunners would remain competitive due to their recruitment.
But he claims Arsenal's recent transfer policy has "not been great" and will make it impossible to win the title.
He added: “Alex Ferguson came in for me but I wouldn't leave and I said to the chairman: ‘Have we got ambition at the club?'
“He said: ‘Don't worry, we are injecting a lot of money and we are going to go for it.’
“I stayed and the rest is history - Dennis Bergkamp came and Nicolas Anelka, Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel Petit, Robert Pires - we had five World Cup winners in the team.
“It is a completely different club today and I think recruitment at Arsenal for a good few years has not been great.
“Now we seem to be selling our best players and you are never going to recruit a championship squad selling all your best players.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tony Adams sends warning to Arsenal over Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang transfer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tony Adams says Arsenal’s history of selling their top players may mean star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will ‘walk out the door’ this summer.
The Gabon international has just one year remaining on his current deal at the Emirates Stadium, prompting interest from Chelsea, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona.
The Gunners’ inability to challenge for league titles over the last decade, allied to their delicate financial situation, has seen them lose world-class talents such as Cesc Fabregas and Robin van Persie.
And club legend Adams fears the same may happen with Aubameyang, telling Sky Sports: ‘Quite possibly, he could walk out the door.
‘I loved [former manager] Arsene Wenger’s principles, that no player was bigger than the club, and he moved players on if it made sense for the club financially.
‘He was strong with that and he got Champions League football every year but it did stand in the way of recruitment – so we have become a club that is selling the best players.
‘If I was a coach I’d be saying, “Don’t sell Aubameyang at any price, we need to recruit, bring players through the academy and keep our best players”.’
Adams, who won 10 major trophies at Arsenal in three different decades, says the recruitment policy at the club now is nowhere near as successful as it used to be when he was at Highbury.
He added: ‘They bang on about the class of ’92 [at Manchester United] – in our class of ’83 we had six internationals in our youth team – Niall Quinn, Paul Merson, Michael Thomas, Rocky [David Rocastle], me and Martin [Keown].
‘But put that on top of [board member] Danny Fiszman putting a lot of money into the club in ’95, ’96 and we were getting world class players come to Arsenal football club.
‘[Manchester United manager] Alex Ferguson came in for me but I wouldn’t leave and I said to the chairman ‘have we got ambition at the club?’
‘He said, “Don’t worry, we are injecting a lot of money and we are going to go for it”.
‘I stayed and the rest is history – Dennis [Bergkamp] came and Nicolas Anelka, [Patrick] Vieira, Manu [Emmanuel Petit], Robert Pires – we had five World Cup winners in the team.’
‘It is a completely different club today and I think recruitment at Arsenal for a good few years has not been great.
‘Now we seem to be selling our best players and you are never going to recruit a championship squad selling all your best players.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tennis: Feels surreal to be back on court, says Germany's Brown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON (Reuters) - Germany’s Dustin Brown said returning to competitive action at the Tennis Point Exhibition Series in Germany this week amidst the coronavirus pandemic was a surreal experience.
Brown, who famously beat Rafa Nadal at Wimbledon in 2015, is the highest-profile player in the eight-man field at the event being held at the Base Tennis centre near Koblenz.
The ATP and WTA Tours remain suspended until mid-July at the earliest, but the event in Brown’s home country, the first of three that will form the Exo Tennis Series, has at least offered the chance of some competitive action.
“It’s nice to finally play, it’s a little surreal to be honest, with everything that is actually going on in the world,” former world number 64 Brown said after winning his opening two round-robin matches on Friday.
“With all the safety guidelines I think everyone has done pretty well, doing their best. Even sometimes when it’s not that easy. Very happy to be out here and have some fun.”
The event is taking place without spectators, line judges and ball kids and there are no handshakes after the match.
Players arrive alone and have their own designated space in the venue to prepare. Once on court they sit at opposite sides during the changeovers. The event continues until Monday.
Matches on the indoor claycourt are played over a short format, first to four games and no advantage scoring.
Brown, speaking to the Tennis Channel who are streaming the action live, said in some respects it was a little easier.
“There is not that much pressure,” the 35-year-old, who helped devise the format with Base Tennis owner Rodney Rapson, said. “It’s hard to get up and train when you don’t know when you can play so this event has definitely helped the mindset for the last couple of weeks, knowing something might happen.
“It’s been a little light at the end of the tunnel.”
Brown, who missed the second half of last year because of injury and slipped to 239th in the world, is back on court on Saturday when he will face Britain’s Jan Choinski.
After the conclusion of the eight-man round-robin group, a series of playoff will be contested on Monday to decide the standings. The next Exo Tennis event starts on May 7.

"It's nice to finally play, it's a little surreal to be honest, with everything that is actually going on in the world," former world number 64 Brown said after winning his opening two round-robin matches on Friday.
"With all the safety guidelines I think everyone has done pretty well, doing their best. Even sometimes when it's not that easy. Very happy to be out here and have some fun."
The event is taking place without spectators, line judges and ball kids and there are no handshakes after the match.
Players arrive alone and have their own designated space in the venue to prepare. Once on court they sit at opposite sides during the changeovers. The event continues until Monday.
Matches on the indoor claycourt are played over a short format, first to four games and no advantage scoring.
Brown, speaking to the Tennis Channel who are streaming the action live, said in some respects it was a little easier.
"There is not that much pressure," the 35-year-old, who helped devise the format with Base Tennis owner Rodney Rapson, said. "It's hard to get up and train when you don't know when you can play so this event has definitely helped the mindset for the last couple of weeks, knowing something might happen.
"It's been a little light at the end of the tunnel."
Brown, who missed the second half of last year because of injury and slipped to 239th in the world, is back on court on Saturday when he will face Britain's Jan Choinski.
After the conclusion of the eight-man round-robin group, a series of playoff will be contested on Monday to decide the standings. The next Exo Tennis event starts on May 7.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: Germany's Dustin Brown said returning to competitive action at the Tennis Point Exhibition Series in Germany this week amidst the coronavirus pandemic was a surreal experience.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League could roll out 'neutral' ground plan to all 20 stadiums next season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Premier League clubs have been told the “eight to ten” neutral ground plan is an experiment - and all 20 could be used next season.
Mirror Sport can reveal the Premier League stressed to clubs it was the Government and the police who have insisted on the “approved” stadium idea in Project Restart with all remaining 92 games behind closed doors.
But it was made clear in last Friday’s meeting that if it goes to plan then next season all 20 grounds could be opened up for Premier League games and the end of this season was described as a “test run” for the neutral venues.
However, it is still uncertain even then whether clubs could return to playing at their own grounds because of the fear of fans turning up at their stadium or, more worryingly, congregating at nearby pubs.
The neutral grounds being used for the rest of the season is seen as the biggest single stumbling block in resuming the season with relegation-threatened clubs insisting that home advantage will be crucial to winning games during the run-in.
But the fear is that fans would still turn up in their droves to their own grounds and break social distancing rules which are likely to be in place well into next season which is why clubs are already resigned to behind closed doors games for much of the 2020/21 season.
However, some clubs believe you could not start next season in neutral venues and finish it with clubs playing in their own stadiums with home advantage as that would be unfair so there is a possibility that it could be neutral venues for the whole campaign.
It is believed that they have still not decided on which grounds can get approved but West Ham, Manchester City, Leicester, Southampton and Brighton have all been discussed as they are “out of town.”
But the neutral grounds is the biggest sticking point among clubs opposed to restarting but it needs a 14-6 majority to restart with the clubs set to meet again this coming Friday.
Mirror Sport understands that Brighton, West Ham, Bournemouth, Watford, Norwich and Aston Villa all raised objections in the meeting.
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has already spoken up publicly about the neutral ground issue, West Ham raised concerns about player welfare and yet it is still unknown as to how they will all vote.
But, according to a source, there was a clear 14-6 split.
There is believed to be a number of clubs who believe relegation should be scrapped if they have to go ahead in neutral grounds.
That could mean starting next season with 22 clubs with no clubs going down but Leeds and West Brom promoted.
One way that could be made attractive to the EFL would be to turn the parachute payments for relegated clubs into increasing the solidarity payments from the Premier League for the three lower divisions.
The FA Cup is still being factored into the plan and the final could be played on August 8 while the FA have already offered up as Wembley and St George’s Park as potential venues to play out the season.
While they are understood to be “off the table” for Premier League games, they could be used for the FA Cup with the final likely to be played at Wembley behind closed doors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Premier League can overcome restart challenges’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady insists that every Premier League club wants to complete the season despite there being “a lot of obstacles” to restarting the campaign.
Clubs were presented with the league’s “Project Restart” plans at a meeting on Friday and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-2020 season must be played at neutral venues.
That is an extra sticking point to a litany of other logistical issues as there remains opposition on sporting integrity grounds about the idea of not finishing the campaign on a home-and-away basis.
“At yesterday’s meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart,” said Brady in her column for the Sun newspaper.
“The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game.
“Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again.
“There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said on Thursday that the idea of not playing matches home and away was a “further imperfection” on top of games being behind closed doors.
Before plans to return to playing can progress, the Premier League clubs must also address the thorny issues of testing and player welfare.
Players, coaches and backroom staff would reportedly be tested two or three times a week and could be forced to quarantine in hotels away from their families to help prevent the spread of the virus.
The Bundesliga’s ambitious plans to return to playing matches this month were dealt a blow with the news on Friday that three people at Cologne have tested positive for coronavirus and been placed in a 14-day quarantine.
Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero admitted this week that players are “scared” at the prospect of being rushed back into action, while Brighton’s Glenn Murray questioned whether it is right for football’s return to drain resources from public services such as ambulance crews and police.
The proposal of neutral venues by the Premier League is designed to reduce the number of medical, security and broadcast personnel needed at every match.
“It’s clear that the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval from both the Government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority,” added Brady.
“They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brighton, West Ham raise doubts about neutral venues for Premier League</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brighton has become the first English Premier League club to publicly oppose plans to try to restart the season in neutral stadiums during the coronavirus pandemic.
As the COVID-19 death toll surpassed 28,000 in Britain, Brighton chief executive Paul Barber accepted that resuming sporting events would require compromises but said Saturday that the league's integrity would be damaged if teams couldn't play at home.
West Ham vice chair Karren Brady said "no one wants" neutral stadiums but was not as direct in her opposition to the league's "Project Restart" plan, given the need for authorities to approve venues.
The Premier League sees using only up to half of the 20 stadiums as the most viable way of completing the season, which was suspended almost two months ago.

Police also have backed teams not playing at home, even with no fans present, to prevent them from gathering outside the stadiums. Supporters are likely to be prevented from attending sporting events for many months in Britain to limit the spread of COVID-19 infections.
The Premier League, which held a conference call with all clubs on Friday, hopes team training sessions can resume within weeks but games are not likely to be played for at least another month.
"Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises," Barber said, "and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.
"But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition."
Barber said Brighton had not been approached about using its Amex Stadium, which is more isolated than the likes of Anfield, which is surrounded by rows of tightly packed houses in Liverpool. West Ham also has a venue that fans can be kept away from as it sits on the Olympic Park used for the 2012 Games.
The government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority would have to approve the locations of games during the pandemic.
"They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance," Brady said. "But like everything else, nothing has been agreed."
West Ham and Brighton are in a scrap to avoid relegation with nine games remaining. Brighton is two points and three places above the drop zone. West Ham is only out of danger due to a superior goal difference.
Barber highlighted how four of Brighton's five remaining home games are against some of Europe's biggest clubs: Arsenal, Manchester United, leader Liverpool and defending champion Manchester City.
"The disadvantages of us not playing the league's top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious," Barber said.
"Clearly, we must accept there may also be some benefit from playing our remaining four away matches at neutral venues but the fixture list simply isn't equally balanced at this stage of the season, and we didn't play our first 29 matches of the season in this way. So, in our opinion one thing doesn't cancel out the other."
Britain's national lockdown currently runs through Thursday, with the league waiting to see how restrictions will be eased and whether the competition can restart now the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak has passed.
Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, whose responsibilities include sport, said after talks with leagues on Friday that he was working on plans that deliver for Britons who "desperately want sport back on."
But Brighton striker Glenn Murray has expressed reservations about playing again soon given the risks of players spreading the coronavirus.
"I understand the public is desperate to get football back, but it is us that are going to be going out there and competing against other teams," Murray said. "Everyone is in different situations, I have children at home, I wouldn't want to jeopardize them, some footballers have newly born children who might be more susceptible to getting the disease. Some are living with elderly parents. It is a really difficult situation to agree on."
Isolated sessions at training grounds started last week at some clubs, including Brighton, for players to do individual fitness work. Phase two of the restart plan envisages group training be allowed again, then approval would be required for the restart of domestic fixtures.
"The only common theme from all the clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game," Brady wrote in Saturday's editions of 'The Sun' newspaper. "There is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again. There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make."
Liverpool has a 25-point lead with nine games left.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Perth suggested as EPL base as clubs air doubts about neutral venues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An English agent based in Perth has reportedly suggested – and received support from some clubs and an Australian senator – that the English Premier League season could be completed in Western Australia.
However, some Premier League clubs have already come out publicly against the proposal to try and restart the season in neutral stadiums amid the coronavirus pandemic.
As the COVID-19 death toll surpassed 28,000 in Britain, Brighton & Hove Albion became the first English Premier League club to publicly oppose plans.
Chief executive Paul Barber accepted that resuming sporting events would require compromises but said on Saturday that the league's integrity would be damaged if teams could not play at home.
West Ham vice-chairwoman Karren Brady said "no one wants" neutral stadiums but was not as direct in her opposition to the league's "Project Restart" plan, given the need for authorities to approve venues.
Brighton and West Ham are in a scrap to avoid relegation, with the Seagulls having five of their nine remaining games scheduled to be played at home.
The Premier League sees using only up to half of the 20 stadiums as the most viable way of completing the season, which was suspended almost two months ago.
But the UK Sun reported that Australia could host the remaining games of the Premier League season, with English agent Gary Williams, who lives in Perth, behind the proposal.
The Sun also reported that Williams' proposal had been backed by Labor senator Glenn Sterle and that several Premier League clubs had been "alerted and are happy to oblige".
"I have had discussions with contacts at Premier League clubs and they like the idea," Williams told the paper.
"I have also spoken with government officials and they are enthusiastic. We are speaking again this week.
"Everybody is safe here. The government has lifted many restrictions.
"We are sitting round in groups of ten, we can walk around and the beaches are open. We have had four new cases in the last ten days."
Supporters in Britain are likely to be prevented from attending sporting events for many months to limit the spread of COVID-19 infections.
The Premier League, which held a conference call with all clubs on Friday, hopes team training sessions can resume within weeks – after isolated sessions at training grounds started last week at some clubs – but games are not likely to be played for at least another month.
"Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games..." Barber said.
"But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition."
Barber said Brighton had not been approached about using their Amex Stadium, which is more isolated than the likes of Anfield, while West Ham also have a venue that fans can be kept away from as it sits on the Olympic Park used for the 2012 Games.
The government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority would have to approve the locations of games during the pandemic.
"They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance," Brady said.
"But like everything else, nothing has been agreed."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Football: West Ham vice-chairman sure Premier League can overcome restart challenges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady insists that every Premier League club wants to complete the season despite there being "a lot of obstacles" to restarting the campaign.
LONDON: West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady insists that every Premier League club wants to complete the season despite there being "a lot of obstacles" to restarting the campaign.
Clubs were presented with the league's "Project Restart" plans at a meeting on Friday (May 1) and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-2020 season must be played at neutral venues.
That is an extra sticking point to a litany of other logistical issues as there remains opposition on sporting integrity grounds about the idea of not finishing the campaign on a home-and-away basis.
"At yesterday's meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart," said Brady in her column for the Sun newspaper.
"The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game.
"Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again.
"There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make."
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said on Thursday that the idea of not playing matches home and away was a "further imperfection" on top of games being behind closed doors.
Before plans to return to playing can progress, the Premier League clubs must also address the thorny issues of testing and player welfare.
Players, coaches and backroom staff would reportedly be tested two or three times a week and could be forced to quarantine in hotels away from their families to help prevent the spread of the virus.
The Bundesliga's ambitious plans to return to playing matches this month were dealt a blow with the news on Friday that three people at Cologne have tested positive for coronavirus and been placed in a 14-day quarantine.
Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero admitted this week that players are "scared" at the prospect of being rushed back into action, while Brighton's Glenn Murray questioned whether it is right for football's return to drain resources from public services such as ambulance crews and police.
The proposal of neutral venues by the Premier League is designed to reduce the number of medical, security and broadcast personnel needed at every match.
"It's clear that the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval from both the Government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority," added Brady.
"They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance."

The Premier League sees using only up to half of the 20 stadiums as the most viable way of completing the season, which was suspended almost two months ago.
Police also have backed teams not playing at home, even with no fans present, to prevent them from gathering outside the stadiums. Supporters are likely to be prevented from attending sporting events for many months in Britain to limit the spread of COVID-19 infections.
The Premier League, which held a conference call with all clubs on Friday, hopes team training sessions can resume within weeks but games are not likely to be played for at least another month.
“Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises,” Barber said, "and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government’s efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.
“But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition.”
Barber said Brighton had not been approached about using its Amex Stadium, which is more isolated than the likes of Anfield, which is surrounded by rows of tightly packed houses in Liverpool. West Ham also has a venue that fans can be kept away from as it sits on the Olympic Park used for the 2012 Games.
The government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority would have to approve the locations of games during the pandemic.
“They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance,” Brady said. “But like everything else, nothing has been agreed.”
West Ham and Brighton are in a scrap to avoid relegation with nine games remaining. Brighton is two points and three places above the drop zone. West Ham is only out of danger due to a superior goal difference.
Barber highlighted how four of Brighton's five remaining home games are against some of Europe's biggest clubs: Arsenal, Manchester United, leader Liverpool and defending champion Manchester City.
“The disadvantages of us not playing the league’s top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious," Barber said.
“Clearly, we must accept there may also be some benefit from playing our remaining four away matches at neutral venues but the fixture list simply isn’t equally balanced at this stage of the season, and we didn’t play our first 29 matches of the season in this way. So, in our opinion one thing doesn’t cancel out the other.”
Britain's national lockdown currently runs through Thursday, with the league waiting to see how restrictions will be eased and whether the competition can restart now the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak has passed.
Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, whose responsibilities include sport, said after talks with leagues on Friday that he was working on plans that deliver for Britons who “desperately want sport back on.”
But Brighton striker Glenn Murray has expressed reservations about playing again soon given the risks of players spreading the coronavirus.
“I understand the public is desperate to get football back, but it is us that are going to be going out there and competing against other teams," Murray said. “Everyone is in different situations, I have children at home, I wouldn’t want to jeopardize them, some footballers have newly born children who might be more susceptible to getting the disease. Some are living with elderly parents. It is a really difficult situation to agree on.”
Isolated sessions at training grounds started last week at some clubs, including Brighton, for players to do individual fitness work. Phase two of the restart plan envisages group training be allowed again, then approval would be required for the restart of domestic fixtures.
“The only common theme from all the clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game," Brady wrote in Saturday’s editions of “The Sun” newspaper. "There is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again. There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
Liverpool has a 25-point lead with nine games left.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brady: Lots of obstacles to overcome before EPL can restart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON (AP) - The 20 English Premier League clubs all want to complete the season but there are also a lot of obstacles to overcome, West Ham vice chair Karren Brady said Saturday.
The clubs were presented with the league’s “Project Restart” plans at a meeting on Friday and were told that the remaining 92 matches of a 2019-20 season halted by the coronavirus pandemic must be played behind closed doors at eight to 10 neutral stadiums, which could prove a major sticking point.
“At yesterday’s meeting every club said it wants the season to restart,” Brady wrote in editions of “The Sun” newspaper. “We all know it is going to take a lot of working together, good faith, careful thought and compromises if we have any chance of that happening.
“The only common theme from all the clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game. Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again. There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
Brady detailed a four-phase plan for a return, with the first one - isolated sessions at training grounds - already under way. Phase two would be a return to group training, phase three is the restart of games and the final phase would see a return to international matches.
“Phase three will include discussions on the possibility of playing at neutral grounds, which no one wants, but it’s clear the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval,” she said.
“Project Restart” has June 8 as the potential earliest date for matches. It means if Liverpool’s 30-year title drought ends - the team has a 25-point lead with nine games remaining - it will not happen in front of its own fans or at its Anfield stadium.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WEST HAM vice-chairman Karren Brady says that every Premier League club wants to complete the season but has warned there are “a lot of obstacles” to overcome.
Clubs were presented with the league’s ‘Project Restart’ plans at a meeting yesterday and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-20 season must be played at neutral venues.
That could prove to be a sticking point as there remains opposition on competition and integrity grounds about the idea of not finishing the campaign on a home-and-away basis.

“Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again.
“There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
Brady has detailed a four-phase strategy for a return to action, with the first one – isolated training sessions at training grounds – already under way.
Phase two would be a return to group training, phase three is the restart of domestic games, and the final phase would see a return to international matches.
“Phase three will include discussions on the possibility of playing at neutral grounds, which no one wants, but it’s clear that the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval from both the Government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority,” she added.
“They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance.
“But like everything else, nothing has been agreed as we are still in phase one.”
The PA news agency understands the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing – which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
It is also understood the EFL is still intent on playing the remainder of its campaigns behind closed doors at the regular venues, but the governing body is aware current plans may need to change.

“Phase three will include discussions on the possibility of playing at neutral grounds, which no one wants, but it’s clear that the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval from both the Government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority,” she added.
“They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance.
“But like everything else, nothing has been agreed as we are still in phase one.”
The PA news agency understands the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing – which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
It is also understood the EFL is still intent on playing the remainder of its campaigns behind closed doors at the regular venues, but the governing body is aware current plans may need to change.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady says that every Premier League club wants to complete the season but has warned there are “a lot of obstacles” to overcome.
Clubs were presented with the league’s ‘Project Restart’ plans at a meeting on Friday and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-20 season must be played at neutral venues.
That could prove to be a sticking point as there remains opposition on competition and integrity grounds about the idea of not finishing the campaign on a home-and-away basis.
“At yesterday’s meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart,” she wrote in her column for the Sun.
“We all know that it is going to take a lot of working together, good faith, careful thought and compromises if we have any chance of that happening.
“The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game.
“Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again.
“There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">James Milner's fear with Liverpool so close to Premier League title</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">James Milner says Liverpool are desperate to get their hands on the Premier League trophy amid fears the coronavirus pandemic will scupper their title hopes.
Liverpool were just two wins away from securing a first top-flight title in 30 years when the season was suspended in March following the Covid-19 outbreak.
June 12 is the new target for restarting the season after the 20 Premier League clubs met for their latest video conference on Friday.
But it is still unclear whether the campaign will resume then, with many players reportedly concerned about whether it will be safe for them to return to action.
Milner says he and his Liverpool teammates were determined to build on their Champions League triumph last season with more silverware.
They have since won the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup, of course, but ending the club's 30-year wait for the title is the prize they really crave.
And Milner said the fear of being one-hit wonders has been driving Liverpool on.
“It’s a similar thing that we had at Man City," said Milner, who won two titles with Manchester City after first helping them to FA Cup glory.
“It was so important to get off the mark and win that first trophy and it was massive for us as a group.
“It’s always important to win that first one and we managed to get the Super Cup and the World Championship this year and it’d be nice to add more.
“But it was big to get over the line and add that first one together as a team and that then gives you all the tools to go on and push on, and hopefully we can win more.
“We don’t want to be known as the team that won just that one trophy. We want to push on and see if we can win as many as we can.”

Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said on Thursday that the idea of not playing matches home and away was a "further imperfection" on top of games being behind closed doors. Before plans to return to playing can progress, the Premier League clubs must also address the thorny issues of testing and player welfare.

Players, coaches and backroom staff would reportedly be tested two or three times a week and could be forced to quarantine in hotels away from their families to help prevent the spread of the virus.
The Bundesliga's ambitious plans to return to playing matches this month were dealt a blow with the news on Friday that three people at Cologne have tested positive for coronavirus and been placed in a 14-day quarantine.
Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero admitted this week that players are "scared" at the prospect of being rushed back into action, while Brighton's Glenn Murray questioned whether it is right for football's return to drain resources from public services such as ambulance crews and police.
The proposal of neutral venues by the Premier League is designed to reduce the number of medical, security and broadcast personnel needed at every match.
"It's clear that the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval from both the Government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority," added Brady. "They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance."

“They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance.

    <h5 class="mb-1">West Ham’s Brady sure Premier League can overcome restart challenges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON, May 2 — West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady insists that every Premier League club wants to complete the season despite there being “a lot of obstacles” to restarting the campaign.
Clubs were presented with the league’s “Project Restart” plans at a meeting yesterday and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-2020 season must be played at neutral venues.
That is an extra sticking point to a litany of other logistical issues as there remains opposition on sporting integrity grounds about the idea of not finishing the campaign on a home-and-away basis.
“At yesterday’s meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart,” said Brady in her column for the Sun newspaper.
“The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game.
“Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again.
“There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said on Thursday that the idea of not playing matches home and away was a “further imperfection” on top of games being behind closed doors.
Before plans to return to playing can progress, the Premier League clubs must also address the thorny issues of testing and player welfare.
Players, coaches and backroom staff would reportedly be tested two or three times a week and could be forced to quarantine in hotels away from their families to help prevent the spread of the virus.
The Bundesliga’s ambitious plans to return to playing matches this month were dealt a blow with the news yesterday that three people at Cologne have tested positive for coronavirus and been placed in a 14-day quarantine.
Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero admitted this week that players are “scared” at the prospect of being rushed back into action, while Brighton’s Glenn Murray questioned whether it is right for football’s return to drain resources from public services such as ambulance crews and police.
The proposal of neutral venues by the Premier League is designed to reduce the number of medical, security and broadcast personnel needed at every match.
“It’s clear that the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval from both the Government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority,” added Brady.
“They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance.” — AFP

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Every club said it wants the season to restart’ - West Ham vice-chairman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady says that every Premier League club wants to complete the season but has warned there are “a lot of obstacles” to overcome.
Clubs were presented with the league’s ‘Project Restart’ plans at a meeting on Friday and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-20 season must be played at neutral venues.
That could prove to be a sticking point as there remains opposition on competition and integrity grounds about the idea of not finishing the campaign on a home-and-away basis.
“At yesterday’s meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart,” she wrote in her column for the Sun.
“We all know that it is going to take a lot of working together, good faith, careful thought and compromises if we have any chance of that happening.
“The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game.
“Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again.
“There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
Brady has detailed a four-phase strategy for a return to action, with the first one — isolated training sessions at training grounds — already under way.
Phase two would be a return to group training, phase three is the restart of domestic games, and the final phase would see a return to international matches.
“Phase three will include discussions on the possibility of playing at neutral grounds, which no one wants, but it’s clear that the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval from both the UK government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority,” she added.
“They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance.
“But like everything else, nothing has been agreed as we are still in phase one.”
According to media reports in the UK, the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing — which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
It is also understood the EFL is still intent on playing the remainder of its campaigns behind closed doors at the regular venues, but the governing body is aware current plans may need to change.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Matteo Darmian tells Manchester United what to do with Solskjaer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Matteo Darmian has given his backing to manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and believes Manchester United should hand the Norwegian a long-term contract at Old Trafford.
Darmian was managed by Solskjaer during the second half of the 2018-19 season but left the club last summer to join Serie A side Parma.
"I can only speak well about Solskjaer, believe me," Darmian told The Guardian. "I would give him a long-term contract.
"He’s a very prepared coach and Manchester United has started this project, this journey, with many young players, many British players and they will continue with this project.
"Because of the person I got to know, I hope Solskjaer has success at the club."
Meanwhile, Darmian believes there is no limit to Marcus Rashford's potential at United and thinks the England international can reach the levels of Paris Saint-Germain superstar Kylian Mbappe.
Rashford had netted 19 goals for United this season before football was postponed in mid-March.
"I still remember Marcus Rashford’s first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday," Darmian added.
"I immediately thought: ‘wow, this is an incredible player’. He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me.
"If he continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d’Or winner. I’m convinced of this.
"He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he’s very young and can still improve. For me he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappé and compete for the Ballon d’Or for years to come."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marcelo Discusses Leaving Real Madrid & Wades in on Lionel Messi/Cristiano Ronaldo Debate</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Long serving Real Madrid defender Marcelo has no plans to leave the club this summer, and has no inclination that he will be sold.
The 31-year-old has become part of the Santiago Bernabeu furniture, making over 500 appearances in all competitions after joining from Fluminense in 2007.
The Brazilian has come under pressure from summer signing Ferland Mendy for a regular first team place this season, limiting him to just 11 La Liga appearances before football was forced to take an extended break due to the coronavirus pandemic.
But Marcelo's lack of minutes hasn't called his loyalty to the club into question, though, with an Instagram Q&A with former teammate Fabio Cannavaro revealing that he has no plans to go anywhere just yet, despite past interest from Juventus.
"I don't want to leave and I don't think Real Madrid will sell me," Marcelo said, in quotes carried by Marca.
"I have done very well at Madrid since arriving. It's been a long time and it's an incredible story. I do think it's good that other teams are interested in me, but I don't know about Juventus.
"Two years ago I had already signed with them [Juventus], and had their shirt on because I couldn't live without Cristiano Ronaldo. People make up a lot of things."
Inevitably, after spending the best part of a decade playing with Ronaldo, Marcelo was also quizzed about whether the Portuguese star is better than Barcelona's Lionel Messi.
His reply was diplomatic enough, praising both for differing qualities, adding that it's impossible to say one way or the other.
"You can't say who is better," Marcelo retorted. "I played with Cristiano for 10 years, and the motivation he gives you is unique, how he raises your own game. You think Messi is under control, then out of nowhere he scores a goal."
When Marcelo eventually does leave Real Madrid, he'll depart as one of the most decorated players in the club's history. To date, he has won 21 honours - including four Champions League titles and four La Liga crowns.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roma chief sends message to Man Utd over Chris Smalling transfer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">AS Roma manager Paulo Fonseca says the club are keen on securing on-loan Manchester United defender Chris Smalling on a permanent transfer this summer.
The centre-back has impressed on his season-long loan in the Serie A, making 21 league appearances before the season was postponed over the coronavirus crisis.
Smalling has been at Old Trafford since 2010, but his spot in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side was lost to the world’s most expensive defender, Harry Maguire.
With the 30-year-old’s stay in Italy due to come to an end, Fonseca wants to keep one of the ‘leaders of the dressing room’ around for longer.
‘I will do everything I can to keep him at Roma next year too.I know he wants to stay, let’s see what happens,’ he told ESPN.
‘He’s an amazing man, so humble, so professional.
‘He is adored by the fans and established himself as one of the leaders in the dressing room.
‘It’s not easy for English central defenders to adapt so quickly to Italian football, the record there isn’t good. But he has been amazing.’
United are in the market for another centre-back to pair up with Maguire in defence, with RB Leipzig’s Ibrahima Konate the latest to be linked with a move to Old Trafford.
According to Le 10 Sport, the Red Devils have reportedly made contact with the 20-year-old’s agent to enquire about a potential summer transfer.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Roma head coach Paulo Fonseca says he's determined to keep Chris Smalling at the club for at least one more season.
The England defender has impressed while on loan from Manchester United this term, making 28 appearances and helping the club keep nine clean sheets. Smalling's form has put in line for a recall to Gareth Southgate's England squad while United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hinted that he return to Old Trafford for the 2021 campaign.
Fonseca says 30-year-old Smalling, who has two years remaining on his United contract, has been "amazing" and has become a leader in their dressing room.
"I will do everything I can to keep him at Roma next year too," the Roma boss told ESPN. "I know he wants to stay, let's see what happens.
"He's an amazing man, so humble, so professional. He is adored by the fans and established himself as one of the leaders in the dressing room.
"It's not easy for English central defenders to adapt so quickly to Italian football, the record there isn't good. But he has been amazing."
Meanwhile Fonseca is backing young midfielder Nicolo Zaniolo to become one of the best players in Europe:
"He's not just a wonderful natural talent, he's a player who improved considerably this year. I used to say he was like a wild man, following his instincts, but now he understands the game, understands the space, understands the decision-making.
"I have no doubt that in a few years he'll be one of the best players not just in Italy but in all of Europe."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tim Sherwood opens up on Tottenham spell and how he dealt with Emmanuel Adebayor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tim Sherwood has lifted the lid on his brief spell as Tottenham Hotspur manager, discussing how he brought Emmanuel Adebayor back to the first team and why he does not resent chairman Daniel Levy for sacking him.
Former Spurs midfielder Sherwood took over at White Hart Lane after Andre Villas-Boas was sacked in December 2013 and he immediately brought Adebayor back to the first team.
Villas-Boas had demoted the Togo striker to training with the youth teams - whom Sherwood had been coaching - but Adebayor made a big impact on his return to first team action, scoring eight goals in 10 Premier League matches.
And Sherwood believes that Spurs players such as Adebayor had been restricted by Villas-Boas' coaching and flourished under a more expressive style of play.
"I knew I was holding fort before Pochettino came in," Sherwood told the Daily Mail. "I also knew there was no point in taking over from Andre Villas-Boas and not changing anything.
"He got sacked for a reason. They weren't winning enough football matches, scoring enough goals, or playing with enough freedom.
"So I looked at the players. Emmanuel Adebayor, for instance, was being isolated, training with me and the kids.

"I always made sure he had the right attitude otherwise I wouldn't have had him there with the boys anyway. I brought him back, and we won more than we lost."
Remarkably, Sherwood's 59.1% win percentage is the best of any Spurs manager in the Premier League but he was sacked by Levy at the end of the 2013/14 season.
Despite this, the former Blackburn Rovers man maintains that he has a "very good" relationship with Levy.
"No, because I knew. I knew the job. I knew the script," Sherwood responded when asked if he felt hard done by after being sacked.
"I knew he was ready to come in and they needed someone in the meantime. It would've been different if I didn't know. Perhaps I would've liked that opportunity, like Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at United. But I knew it wasn't my job."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fonseca 'will do everything' to keep Smalling at Roma</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Roma coach Paulo Fonseca insisted he would be trying everything to keep defender Chris Smalling at the Serie A club.
Smalling, 30, has impressed on loan at Roma from Manchester United this season, but reports suggest they may be unable to afford the transfer fee for the centre-back despite wanting to keep him.
But Fonseca is eager to keep the 31-time England international, praising his impact in Rome.
"I will do everything I can to keep him at Roma next year too. I know he wants to stay, let's see what happens," he told ESPN on Friday.
"He's an amazing man, so humble, so professional. He is adored by the fans and established himself as one of the leaders in the dressing room.
"It's not easy for English central defenders to adapt so quickly to Italian football, the record there isn't good, but he has been amazing."
Smalling had made 28 appearances in all competitions for Roma before the season was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.

City announced last month that they had completed a deal to sign 17-year-old defender Yan Couto from Brazilian outfit Coritiba next season.
It has now been revealed that the Brazilian defender held talks with the Catalan giants, who reportedly considered themselves favourites.
However, Couto reveals his discussion Guardiola proved to be telling reason for his decision to chose the Etihad over the Camp Nou.
"I had a good conversation with Barcelona and I thought I would go there, but then Manchester City appeared and showed me how things would be there.
"At first, they wanted to loan me out straight away, but then I spoke with Guardiola. He told me that I would do preseason with the first team and from there it would depend on me.
"Guardiola was very attentive and said that he was really happy I was coming to the club. It was the best decision for me."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roma boss insists Chris Smalling does not want Manchester United return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Harry Maguire's arrival as the world's most expensive defender last summer left Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with a bloated squad and, while far from the worst centre-back on the books, the 30-year-old was allowed to leave on a year-long loan .
Smalling has shone in Serie A to the point where his England career looks set to be revived, with Gareth Southgate heading to Rome to watch a defender he looked to have all but ruled out ever calling up again.
Solskjaer has spoken of his expectation that in-form Smalling would return to United next season, but Roma boss Fonseca is hoping to keep him in Italy.
"I will do everything I can to keep him at Roma next year too," he told ESPN. "I know he wants to stay, let's see what happens.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roma give transfer update on Manchester United defender Chris Smalling</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Roma head coach Paulo Fonseca says he is doing everything he can to try and extend Chris Smalling's stay with the club.
The Manchester United defender is on loan for the 2019/20 season and has impressed in Serie A.
A deal is yet to have been agreed by the clubs over a potential permanent deal for the 30-year-old, but Fonseca says Smalling wants to stay in Rome, and he is trying to secure a deal.
"I will do everything I can to keep him at Roma next year too," Fonseca told ESPN. "I know he wants to stay, let's see what happens.
"He's an amazing man, so humble, so professional. He is adored by the fans and established himself as one of the leaders in the dressing room.
"It's not easy for English central defenders to adapt so quickly to Italian football, the record there isn't good. But he has been amazing."
Smalling did not play in Roma's opening four games of the season, but has gone on to feature heavily in Serie A since.
He still has two years remaining on his contract at Old Trafford, but is said to have settled well in Italy. Whether United will be tempted to agree to a permanent deal is another matter.

England were scheduled to play tests in Galle and Colombo in March before the coronavirus outbreak shut down sport worldwide as countries introduced lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
"We are in the process of rescheduling the tours that have been postponed," De Silva told Sri Lankan newspaper Daily News. "England has been already rescheduled for the month of January next year but the dates have not been finalised.
"At the same time we are also looking at exploring the possibility of rescheduling postponed tours and looking at the windows which are available and alternatives too.
"South Africa is one of the tours which we are looking at rescheduling. We are engaged in discussions with the member countries and see how it can be planned out."
South Africa's limited-overs tour of Sri Lanka -- three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 games -- was scheduled to take place in June before it was postponed.
"There are also two other tours which are scheduled to take place with India and Bangladesh due to tour Sri Lanka in June-July and July-August respectively," De Silva added.
"We will explore the possibility of playing those two tours in another week or two."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) CEO Ashley de Silva has said that England’s Test tour of Sri Lanka which could not be played out in March due to the coronavirus outbreak has been rescheduled to January 2021.
“We are in the process of rescheduling the tours that have been postponed. England has been already rescheduled for the month of January next year but the dates have not been finalised,” de Silva told Daily News.

“South Africa is one of the tours which we are looking at rescheduling. We are engaged in discussions with the member countries and see how it can be planned out.”
England was playing Sri Lanka President’s XI in a 4-day match at the P. Sara Oval in Colombo when the coronavirus outbreak saw the decision being made by ECB along with the SLC to postpone the tour.
“Due to the COVID-19 pandemic worsening globally, and after discussions with Sri Lanka Cricket, we have today made the decision to return our players to the UK and postpone the forthcoming Test series between Sri Lanka and England.
“At this time, the physical and mental wellbeing of our players and support teams is paramount. We will now look to bring them home to their families as soon as possible. These are completely unprecedented times, and decisions like this go beyond cricket.
“We would like to thank our colleagues at Sri Lanka Cricket for their outstanding support and assistance throughout this situation. We look forward to returning to Sri Lanka in the very near future to fulfil this important Test series,” the ECB had said in a release.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England’s Test tour of Sri Lanka, which could not be completed in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been rescheduled to January next year, claims SLC CEO Ashley de Silva.
England had spent around 10 days in Sri Lanka in March and played a warm-up match before the tour was called-off due to the coronavirus outbreak. It was supposed to be a two-Test series as part of the World Test Championship.
“We are in the process of rescheduling the tours that have been postponed. England has been already rescheduled for the month of January next year but the dates have not been finalised,” de Silva told Daily News.
“At the same time, we are also looking at exploring the possibility of rescheduling postponed tours and looking at the windows which are available and alternatives too.
“South Africa is one of the tours which we are looking at rescheduling. We are engaged in discussions with the member countries and see how it can be planned out.”
However, England are scheduled to tour India in January for a five-Test series, so, it remains to be seen how the scheduling will work out.
All cricketing activity has come to a halt due to the pandemic, throwing the international calendar haywire.
India too were scheduled to tour Sri Lanka for a limited-overs series after the IPL, which has been postponed indefinitely.
“There are also two other tours which are scheduled to take place, with India and Bangladesh due to tour Sri Lanka in June-July and July-August respectively.
“We will explore the possibility of playing those two tours in another week or two,” de Silva added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sri Lanka cricket CEO claims England's Test tour rescheduled to January</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Sri Lanka Cricket Board CEO Ashley de Silva has claimed that England's Test tour of Sri Lanka, which could not be completed in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, has been rescheduled to January next year.
England had spent around 10 days in Sri Lanka in March and played a warm-up match before the tour was called-off due to the Covid-19 outbreak. It was supposed to be a two-Test series as part of the ICC World Test Championship.

"At the same time, we are also looking at exploring the possibility of rescheduling postponed tours and looking at the windows which are available and alternatives too," he said.

"South Africa is one of the tours which we are looking at rescheduling. We are engaged in discussions with the member countries and see how it can be planned out," he said.
However, England are scheduled to tour India in January for a five-Test series, so, it remains to be seen how the scheduling will work out.
All cricketing activity has come to a halt due to the pandemic, throwing the international calendar haywire.
India too were scheduled to tour Sri Lanka for a limited overs series after the IPL, which has been postponed indefinitely.
"There are also two other tours which are scheduled to take place, with India and Bangladesh due to tour Sri Lanka in June-July and July-August respectively," he said.
"We will explore the possibility of playing those two tours in another week or two," de Silva added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Charles Barkley isn’t putting LeBron James and Kobe Bryant into the elite of the elite in NBA history.
The Hall of Famer left the two modern-era stars out of his top 5 NBA players of all-time when asked what his list would be during an appearance on Kentucky coach John Calipari’s “Coffee with Cal” show this week.
“Michael’s [Jordan] one, Oscar Robertson’s two,” Barkley said. “[Bill] Russell, Wilt [Chamberlain] and Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar], no particular order after Michael.”
While James and Bryant and their eight combined NBA championships didn’t make the first five, they did get into Barkley’s top 10.
“Kobe six, LeBron seven, then you’ve got Elgin Baylor, Jerry West,” the former 76ers, Suns and Rockets star said.
Barkley did go on to explain his decision to keep James on the outside looking in, making it a little clearer why his list was slanted more toward the old-school era players.
“You know, I love LeBron and everything about him but I still think that the way they play the game today he didn’t want any part of those bad boy Pistons,” Barkley said. “Let me tell you something, those guys were out there trying to hurt people. I used to always tell people when you were playing the Pistons you had to call home and tell your family you love them just in case you never saw them again.”
James still has time to work his way up and win a fourth championship. If the NBA season restarts after its coronavirus shutdown, James’ Los Angeles Lakers had the second-best record in the league this season behind the Milwaukee Bucks.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ESPN’s docuseries The Last Dance has led many analysts to dish out their rankings of the greatest players in NBA history.
Among them is Sir Charles, who had some very interesting picks. In a recent Facebook conversation with John Calipari, Charles Barkley revealed his seven greatest NBA players ever.
Unsurprisingly, Barkley had Michael Jordan first. Given how frequently Jordan and the Bulls beat up on his 76ers and Suns, Barkley’s respect for MJ is to be expected.
But rounding out Barkley’s list are four players that may raise some eyebrows. He had Oscar Robertson second, followed in no particular order by Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
Barkley then had Kobe Bryant at sixth, then LeBron James seventh, followed by Elgin Baylor and Jerry West.
“Michael’s one, Oscar Robertson’s two,” Barkley said, per Yahoo! Sports. “Russell, Wilt and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, no particular order after Michael. Kobe six, LeBron seven, then you’ve got Elgin Baylor, Jerry West.”
Naturally, Barkley’s decision to leave LeBron outside the top five has people mad. So he preempted  the arguments against that by LeBron would not have been able to handle the Pistons that gave Michael Jordan fits for so many years.
“You know, I love LeBron and everything about him but I still think that the way they play the game today he didn’t want any part of those bad boy Pistons,” Barkley said. “Let me tell you something, those guys were out there trying to hurt people. I used to always tell people when you were playing the Pistons you had to call home and tell your family you love them just in case you never saw them again.”
Do you agree with Charles Barkley’s list of greatest NBA players? Should he have added LeBron or Kobe?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Steve Kerr shares what he believes is Stephen Curry's most underrated quality</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warriors head coach Steve Kerr has had the benefit of having Stephen Curry on his roster throughout the entirety of his head coaching career, upon taking over for Mark Jackson back in 2014.
As such, Kerr knows Curry as well as anyone, seeing him both on and off the court, and watching him drain shots from all over the court, in games and during practice. He’s coached Curry to two MVP awards, with the Warriors having won three titles during that time as well.
Kerr knows a thing or two about greatness, as he played alongside the GOAT, Michael Jordan, on the Bulls. The two won a number of titles together, and were a part of one of the NBA’s greatest dynasties.
And now he coaches arguably the greatest shooter of all time. Kerr recently revealed what he believes is Curry’s most underrated quality — his competitiveness — during an appearance on the “Runnin’ Plays” podcast.
“I think it’s probably Steph’s [Curry] most underrated quality is just how competitive he is, and I think it’s underrated because of just his physical stature and the way he looks,” he began. “He’s so different from your average NBA star. Most NBA stars they’re physically imposing and here’s Steph, he looks like he’s just another guy and then he makes everything looks so easy with his game.
So, you don’t really see the fire, that’s in him. But, you feel it. And when you coach him, or you play with him, you understand how desperately he wants to win. You can see it his work ethic every day. You can see it in his eyes and he is a fierce, fierce competitor, but he’s unique to himself. I think that’s one of the things that makes Steph special is that he has this incredibly rare combination of brash confidence and humility and a fierce competitive desire that is sort of disguised by this unbelievably joyful way of playing basketball.
There’s never been anybody with this kind of combination. And so I think that’s one of the reasons the fans love them so much.”
Interesting.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Charles Barkley Ranks Kobe As 6th Best Player of All-Time, LeBron James Is Seventh (VIDEO)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Charles Barkley is coming through with the hottest of hot takes.
The hall of fame NBA player recently ranked his top NBA players of all-time in a recent interview with University of Kentucky men’s basketball coach John Calipari.
Barkley listed Michael Jordan as No. 1, but then listed Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in no particular order.
He then added that Kobe Bryant was No. 6 and LeBron James was No. 7.
Barkley stated that he did not think James would match up well against the “Bad Boys” Detroit Pistons teams of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
“I do think the way they play the game today, [James] didn’t want any part of those ‘Bad Boy’ Pistons,” Barkley said on Calipari’s Facebook show “Coffee with Cal.'” “Those guys were out there trying to hurt people. I used to always tell people that when you play the Pistons, you gotta call your family and tell them you love them just in case you never saw them again.”
After losing to the Pistons in three-straight playoff series, Jordan and the Bulls decided to hit the weight room, with the Great one gaining 15 pounds of muscle over the summer of 1990. It paid off and the Bulls swept the Pistons in their next playoff meeting.
“I was getting brutally beaten up,” Jordan said in episode four of the documentary series. “And I wanted to administer pain. I wanted to start fighting back.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Panthers' P.J. Walker will miss the XFL, says it was 'real football'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">P.J. Walker was the XFL's first breakout star this spring, and one of its first players to secure an NFL contract after the league shut down. He says he earned that opportunity by playing "real football," which people might question because, after all, this was Vince McMahon's league.
Walker says he and every other XFL player was on a mission to get to the NFL or, in his case, get back to it. The former Temple quarterback was with the Colts for parts of three seasons but was limited to the practice squad.
IYER: Could Walker really challenge Bridgewater in Carolina?
"See, when most people hear XFL, they think of pro wrestling and HE HATE ME jerseys — the stuff everybody remembers from the old XFL’s only previous season, in 2001. The new league that I played in was still owned by Vince McMahon, but there was nothing pro wrestling about it. It was real football," Walker wrote for The Players' Tribune.
"Most XFL teams were really, really good. No gimmicks. No controversies. And I felt like the longer the season would’ve gone the better the league would have gotten — more intense, more competitive," Walker added.
Walker never lost an XFL game; the Roughnecks were 5-0 when play was suspended in March because of the coronavirus outbreak. The league never returned. McMahon declared it bankrupt in April and put it into liquidation.

Now, Walker's college coach, Matt Rhule, is giving his old quarterback a chance to compete for a backup role with the Panthers.
Walker would love to see lots more XFL alums in NFL uniforms, especially with the NFL expanding team rosters. He believes the league's talent level was that good.
"That’s why I’m going to miss the XFL something fierce — and why the NFL will, too," he wrote to close his piece.

    <h5 class="mb-1">QB Kellen Mond: Texas A&M on verge of being elite in 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Texas A&M quarterback Kellen Mond believes his team is on the verge of making a leap in 2020 like LSU did last season, when the Tigers went from 10-3 to a 15-0 national title campaign.
"We really haven't won the big-time games yet," Mond told The Dallas Morning News for a story published Friday. "In some of those games, most of those games, we've been close, but we always fall short. But we have to be able to get over that hump.
"A lot of people emphasize that the last 2% is the hardest. I feel like we're at the last 2% from being a good team to being elite."
The Aggies are coming off an 8-5 season in which they lost to Clemson, Alabama and LSU by double digits when each was ranked No. 1.
That includes a 50-7 blowout defeat to LSU, but Mond also was part of a seven-overtime win over the Tigers in 2018, so he saw the leap they took firsthand.
"It's kind of weird being able to play all those guys and seeing what kind of change LSU made," Mond said. "They were a good team the year we beat them, but becoming an elite team and one of the best teams of all time this past year just kind of shows the work they put in."
Mond hopes the lesson the Aggies take is that "it only takes one year" to show vast improvement.
Texas A&M has reasons to believe a jump is possible. The Aggies played 19 true freshmen last year, they are getting 17 starters back, and coach Jimbo Fisher signed another top-10 recruiting class. They were No. 11 in ESPN's early top 25 in February, and ESPN's Football Power Index gives them a 2% chance of making the College Football Playoff.
Mond, who said he is working on his deep-ball accuracy, believes the Aggies have the makings of a special team in 2020.
"We have a lot of seniors on our team and a lot of guys coming back," Mond told the newspaper. "Usually when you have seniors, you have guys who have played one or two years, but our seniors, we've been playing since we were freshmen, since 17 or 18 years old in college, so we have a lot of games under our belt and a lot of experience."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With football not expected to return in Scotland for months, Saints chairman Steve Brown can take his time to sift through applications for the McDiarmid Park job, of which there will be many.
The credentials of the candidates ahead of the pack at the moment are beyond question, however.
Davidson was Wright’s assistant in the glory years when Saints won the Scottish Cup and were Europa League regulars.
And the fact that he has added to his CV with successful spells as a number two at Dunfermline and, most recently, Millwall, strengthens his hand.
Inverness Caledonian Thistle boss Robertson has the experience of being the man in charge at several clubs over the last two decades, and his work on a tight budget in the Highlands has led to the Hearts legend being talked about as Daniel Stendel’s successor at Tynecastle, should they go down to the Championship.
The interim manager for Saints after Wright’s exit was confirmed on Saturday morning is Alec Cleland.
He has yet to say whether he wants to be considered for the post full-time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tommy Wright could be set for Northern Ireland job after leaving St Johnstone</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tommy Wright has emerged as the favourite to succeed Michael O'Neill as Northern Ireland manager following his departure from Saint Johnstone.
The former Ballymena boss had been in charge at McDiarmid Park since 2013 and still had two years left on his contract.
Wright, who led Saint Johnstone to Scottish FA Cup glory in 2014, says it feels like the "right time" to part company with the club:
"It was extremely difficult, obviously being at the club so long I've got a lot of feelings for the club, lots and lots of happy memories and worked with a lot of good people both on the pitch and off the pitch.
"It was something that was being considered for a while, even as far back as at the end of the season when we finished eighth (in 2017-18).
"We sort of made a decision to see if over the next couple of years we could bring the age of the squad down and it might be time for me to move on. Fortunately, we have done that. There have been two good seasons.
"It's been something that I felt that when you are at a club for a long period of time, sometimes there comes a point where you need a break and I do need a break.
"It's a tough job. People don't give you sympathy being in football management, but it's 365 days and 24 hours a day and I just felt that this season, if we did well, it would have been the perfect time for me to leave the club in a really strong position.
"The future is really bright on the pitch. I won't be the one that will take the team forward but I think that could be good, not only for me but for the club and team as well.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tommy Wright opens up on St Johnstone exit as he pinpoints 'natural end' departure factor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tommy Wright reckons he has left St Johnstone at the "right time" despite the emotion of departing after a brilliant seven year spell with the Perth club.
He leaves as the most successful manager in the history of the club having overseen solid league performances and winning the Scottish Cup.
The Northern Irishman took over from Steve Lomas in the summer of 2013 and still had two years left on his contract.
Plans were already in place to leave the club at the end of the campaign, and he has decided now is the time to part company during the coronavirus lockdown.
Speaking to Saints TV, Wright said: "It was extremely difficult, obviously being at the club so long I've got a lot of feelings for the club, lots and lots of happy memories and worked with a lot of good people both on the pitch and off the pitch.
"It was something that was being considered for a while, even as far back as at the end of the season when we finished eighth (in 2017-18).
"We sort of made a decision to see if over the next couple of years we could bring the age of the squad down and it might be time for me to move on. Fortunately, we have done that. There have been two good seasons.
"It's been something that I felt that when you are at a club for a long period of time, sometimes there comes a point where you need a break and I do need a break.
"It's a tough job. People don't give you sympathy being in football management, but it's 365 days and 24 hours a day and I just felt that this season, if we did well, it would have been the perfect time for me to leave the club in a really strong position.
"The future is really bright on the pitch. I won't be the one that will take the team forward but I think that could be good, not only for me but for the club and team as well.
"Hopefully, I think it can be a top-six side and in a really good position. It hasn't been an easy decision but I think it is the right time."
Wright reminisced about St Johnstone's only Scottish Cup success to date in 2014 when they defeated Dundee United 2-0 at Hampden Park and the club's adventures in the Europa League qualifying rounds.
"I actually had no doubt that we wouldn't win the game," Wright added. "I just had this feeling that it was written in the stars that it was my first season, 50th game and all that. It just felt that we couldn't lose that game.
"Once we got the second goal, I knew there was no chance we would concede two goals and it was just total relief and you can enjoy it.
"When the final whistle went, it was probably the happiest moment of my life.
"The disappointment of Europe, which still irks me, is that we got beat to teams (that we should have beaten). We beat Rosenborg, go out to Minsk; beat Luzern, go out to Trnava.
"If it was the other way round, I don't know if you would get as much satisfaction, but there is always that wee bit of disappointment."
The 56-year-old insisted he has a good relationship with chairman Steve Brown and it was his decision to end his nine-year association with Saints.
"There hasn't been that many downsides. It's been a great job. I've had great support," the Northern Irishman continued.
"It's not a normal manager-chairman relationship. He has supported me immensely. During a period earlier this season, which was the worst run, particularly with the timing of it, he never once put me under any pressure.
"And that shows that I had trust in the players and he had the ultimate trust in me as a manager.
"The relationship is fine. We spoke this week, we spoke over a period of time and it is something that I actually feel that the timing of it is right, right for the club.
"Seven years is a long time to have the same manager. People have to realise that sometimes things come to a natural end."

"The future is really bright on the pitch. I won't be the one that will take the team forward but I think that could be good, not only for me but for the club and team as well.
"Hopefully, I think it can be a top-six side and in a really good position. It hasn't been an easy decision but I think it is the right time."
Wright reminisced about St Johnstone's only Scottish Cup success to date in 2014 when they defeated Dundee United 2-0 at Hampden Park and the club's adventures in the Europa League qualifying rounds.
"I actually had no doubt that we wouldn't win the game," Wright added. "I just had this feeling that it was written in the stars that it was my first season, 50th game and all that. It just felt that we couldn't lose that game.
"Once we got the second goal, I knew there was no chance we would concede two goals and it was just total relief and you can enjoy it.
"When the final whistle went, it was probably the happiest moment of my life.
"The disappointment of Europe, which still irks me, is that we got beat to teams (that we should have beaten). We beat Rosenborg, go out to Minsk; beat Luzern, go out to Trnava.
"If it was the other way round, I don't know if you would get as much satisfaction, but there is always that wee bit of disappointment."
The 56-year-old insisted he has a good relationship with chairman Steve Brown and it was his decision to end his nine-year association with Saints.
"There hasn't been that many downsides. It's been a great job. I've had great support," the Northern Irishman continued.
"It's not a normal manager-chairman relationship. He has supported me immensely. During a period earlier this season, which was the worst run, particularly with the timing of it, he never once put me under any pressure.
"And that shows that I had trust in the players and he had the ultimate trust in me as a manager.
"The relationship is fine. We spoke this week, we spoke over a period of time and it is something that I actually feel that the timing of it is right, right for the club.
"Seven years is a long time to have the same manager. People have to realise that sometimes things come to a natural end."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Catalan outfit's vice-president Jordi Cardoner has already conceded that his club are unlikely to be able to spend big this summer to recruit new players, with swap deals instead expected to take place.
According to the Daily Star, Barca have informed Premier League clubs that nine players, including Antoine Griezmann, will be available during this summer's transfer window.
Griezmann has previously been linked with Manchester United as the Catalan giants seemingly line up a move for Inter Milan's Lautaro Martinez.
The report claims that Luis Suarez, Ousmane Dembele, Ivan Rakitic, Arturo Vidal, Samuel Umtiti, Nelson Semedo and Sergi Roberto have also been made available.
Philippe Coutinho is also allegedly surplus to requirements at Camp Nou, with the Brazil international, who is currently on loan at Bayern Munich, being linked with the likes of Chelsea, Man United and Newcastle United.
The Spanish champions have also been linked with a big-money move for Neymar, but head coach Quique Setienrecently admitted that a deal for the Paris Saint-Germain attacker was unlikely.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Luis Suarez could be heading to the MLS next season
- Barcelona are reportedly ready to listen to MLS’ side Inter Miami
- The La Liga giants are currently in financial problems due to the lockdown
American club Inter Miami, which is co-owned by David Beckham, have made a request to Barcelona about having Luis Suarez as their major signing when the summer transfer window opens.
Quite a number of MLS clubs are looking to have the former Liverpool striker in their team as he has been told he can leave Camp Nou when the right price is offered.

Barca chiefs have hinted that a number of players will be allowed to leave the club and now Suarez is unsure of where he will be playing next.
On the prospect of a switch to USA, he told Spanish newspaper Marca: "You never know. I have a contract at Barcelona but, in the future, it's an attractive league. The United States is a nice option."
At 33, Suarez is also getting to the twilight of his career and as a result, the club are ready to listen to potential clients for the Uruguayan.
His contract with the Spanish team runs until 2021 with an option to further extend the deal for one year.
Meanwhile, Jurgen Klopp is currently planning to make a £80m move for Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele despite the Frenchman’s poor form.
It was gathered that the Liverpool manager is looking to reunite with the player who he liked during their days at German club Borussia Dortmund.

The Catalans are looking for a long term replacement for their ageing forward Luis Suarez who clocked 33 earlier this year.
With Ousmane Dembele failing to justify his huge price tag at Camp Nou, Barca chiefs have now penned down the Argentine star as their next target.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PSG looking to sign Umtiti</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to the French press, PSG are looking for a replacement for Thiago Silva, and they believe there is nobody better than Barcelona's Samuel Umtiti to succeed the Brazilian.
Leonardo, PSG's sports director, has made a list of possible signings for 2020-21. One of the lines to be improved is that of the backline.
PSG would be looking for a successor to Thiago Silva. The player is 35 years old and at the French club they understand that he doesn't have much left in elite football.
Leonardo's favourite to take Thiago Silva's place is Samuel Umititi, who plays for FC Barcelona, according to 'Onze Mundial'.
Main links
They know, however, that the competition will be voracious. Up to six teams would be interested in linking up with the Frenchman: United, Napoli, Inter, Arsenal, Chelsea are all interested. 
Umtiti has a contract with Barça until 2023, but the club will listen to any offer that comes in. 
We will have to see, in any case, if the figure that puts the PSG on the table is enough for Barça to opt for the proposal of the French team.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Barca To Splash €222M On Neymar? Coach Responds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With Neymar being linked with a return to FC Barcelona next season, Blaugrana coach Quique Setien has finally responded to reports of a big-money move for the Brazilian.
Click through the gallery to see Barca's top five expensive signings.
The Brazil international shocked the footballing world in 2017 when he left Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain in a world record move worth €222million.
However, it's not gone according to plan for the attacker whose three years in the French capital has been hampered by injuries.
While Kylian Mbappe has also been touted to move on from PSG in the near future, Neymar was reportedly eager to return to Barcelona this season but the two clubs could not come to an agreement.
It seems it will be more of the same ahead of next season, with Setien ruling out a big-money transfer for the 28-year-old.
"€222 million for him? No. I don't think there is anyone who can spend that much," Setien told Gazzetta dello Sport.
"And small clubs have water in their throats. Many of them lived to the limit and at the first serious jolt they went into crisis. Football lived at an uncontrolled pace."

In his three years with the club, Neymar only notched up 80 appearances, scoring 69 goals and assisting a further 39.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Barcelona 'willing to listen to offers for Luis Suarez' amid coronavirus crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Barcelona are reportedly prepared to let go of Luis Suarez this summer as the Spanish club aims to raise funds amid the lack of match-day income and television money caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
La Liga remains suspended at the moment - though matches are set to resume behind closed doors - and even clubs the size of Barcelona have seen their finances stretched by the pandemic.
The Catalan club have been exploring new ways of generating income and selling players could be one of the tactics used.
Spanish newspaper Marca report that Suarez could be a prime candidate to be offloaded this summer, with many MLS clubs interested in signing the Uruguayan.
Inter Miami president David Beckham has previously spoken of his desire to bring the former Liverpool striker to America, while Suarez himself has admitted that he may move to the MLS one day.
The 33-year-old said some months ago: "You never know. I have a contract at Barcelona but, in the future, it's an attractive league. The United States is a nice option."
However, the report adds that Suarez is still seen as an important player by coaches at Camp Nou and Saurez still has at least one year remaining on his Barcelona contract.
There is an option to extend his deal for a further year beyond 2021 if Suarez plays 60 per cent of Barcelona's games next season.
The Uruguay international has scored 14 goals and provided 11 assists this season, though he has only made 23 appearances in all competitions due to calf and knee injuries.
Barcelona officials are also aware that Suarez has a close bond with superstar teammate Lionel Messi and there are few clubs who will be able to afford his wages.
However, MLS officials would leap at the chance to bring another marquee signing to the league after other striking greats Thierry Henry, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Villa all had spells in America.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Eduardo Camavinga makes decision over Man Utd or Real Madrid transfer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Eduardo Camavinga will reject a move to Manchester United or Real Madrid this summer, according to Rennes manager Julien Stephan.
The 17-year-old made his senior debut a year ago and has already established himself as a regular in Rennes’ midfield this season.
Camavinga is rated as one of the best young talents in France and the midfielder has attracted strong interest from Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane.
Manchester United are also keen on a deal for the France Under-21 international but Rennes claim that Camavinga has chosen to stay in Ligue 1 for another season.
‘It is undoubtedly good news to play in the Champions League for him to stay,’ Stephan told Ouest France.
‘He has a good environment [around him], he is very tied to the club he came through at, to the people around him, and if he plays in the Champions League he will help us.
‘Contrary to what I have read, his intention is to stay with us.
‘He knows that now, after this season, the best thing for him and the most positive thing is to impress in the Champions League with us.
‘I took Eduardo up [to the first team] because I knew him very well from the B team, he had just turned 16 and I knew that, above all, he was mentally prepared.
‘The idea was to start training with the team, because he was very mature, and at the beginning we had to integrate him, without participating, to work every day and learn from the senior players.
‘It was better to make him debut at home because it was the right time.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Jose Mourinho has admitted that he cried the night Real Madrid lost to Bayern Munich in a Champions League semifinal clash
- The German club progressed to the final following their 3-1 win on penalties after both sides played 3-3 aggregate in 180 minutes
Mourinho was denied a chance to win his third UCL title having won two at FC Porto and Inter Milan
Jose Mourinho has recalled the only defeat that brought tears out of his eyes was when Bayern Munich defeated Real Madrid 3-1 on penalties in the semifinal of Champions League in 2012.
The Portuguese-born tactician was on his way to the final of the elite championship having come back from a 2-1 loss at the Allianz Arena in the first leg to win the second match by the same scoreline.
But their failure to convert their chances in the shootouts ended their quest of winning double the same season after setting a record in the La Liga.

Cristiano Ronaldo was one of the players who missed the spot-kick on the night as Manuel Nueur shouldered his team to the final which they went ahead to win.
Madrid had a fantastic season that year and they were tagged favourites to win the European trophy but the 57-year-old missed out of his third UCL glory.
Apart from Ronaldo, Kaka and Sergio Ramos were the other Madristars who failed to covert their penalties at the Santiago Bernabeu eight years ago.
Mourinho told Spanish news platform Marca that the defeat was a sour loss for him, adding that he was reduced to tears after failing to win La Decima.
He said: "Unfortunately, that's football. "Cristiano, Kaka, Sergio Ramos... three complete monsters of football, there's no doubt about that, but they're also human.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This game was only going to go one single way and the final result proved to shock absolutely nobody with Hoffenheim walking away with a win. The away side went into the game in better form and a better league position with Augsburg losing three out of their last five games. But this still put up a decent fight in the opening half despite fading away towards the end.
The second half was a carbon copy of the first although Augsburg pulled one back after Hoffenheim scored twice, including one three minutes into the second half. While the hosts did look like they might grab the equalizer, nothing went their way and they walked away with another loss. The stats proved as much with Hoffenheim creating 72 dangerous attacks as compared to 59.

A dominating game from the side in contention for a title with Borussia Dortmund sweeping aside Mainz despite a brave performance from the away side. The hosts walked into the game with just one loss (and three wins) in their last five games with Mainz struggling to do the same. It proved on the field with Dortmund scoring two goals before the end of the first half.
Things didn’t change in the second half although Mainz did put up more of a fight. They forced the Dortmund goalkeeper into five saves with all but two coming in the second half. But their potential for dangerous attacks increased with 47 although Dortmund did produce 65 in comparison.

There seemed to be nothing Hertha Berlin could do in the first half with Freiburg dominating the game and the scoreline. They punished any mistake the away side made and eventually caused problems to the scoreline, netting two goals in the space of six minutes. Berlin, in comparison, did next to nothing to hurt their hosts with just five shots in total in the first half.
Freiburg, on the other hand, had 10 shots on goal. Nothing changed in the second half with the away side crumbling but somehow, Freiburg struggled to find the net again. They fired 11 shots on goal with five on target and forced five saves but couldn’t improve their scoreline. Despite that everything went their way with 60 dangerous attacks as compared to Berlin’s mere 39.

A dismal start to the first half from Leipzig saw them struggle to create anything but Fortuna Dusseldorf was unfortunately sailing in the same boat. However, somehow the away side managed to net two goals in the final ten minutes of the half to walk into the second half with a lead. That combined with a half time pep talk did see things change for Leipzig.
But unfortunately, there seemed to be nothing the hosts could do to breach Dusseldorf’s goal for the first forty minutes of the second half. Then four minutes before full-time Leipzig managed to pull one back and nearly got themselves a second but that simply never worked. It wasn’t the greatest showing however and Dusseldorf stood tall and held onto their lead.

About as one-sided as a game could get and yet, somehow Paderborn walked out with a point. The away side were dominated in nearly every single department on the statistics board but they managed to equalise in the second half and walked away with a point. The first half struggled for action but Union Berlin, the better side in the opening 45, walked into the break with a lead.
That did not last for long after the restart with Paderborn scoring seven minutes into the second half from only their fourth shot on goal. They would take only three more before the game was over as compared to Berlin’s 13 on goal and six on target. But shockingly, despite only spending 44% of their time in dangerous attacks, Paderborn produced 66 dangerous attacks as compared to Berlin’s 56.

A simple 1-0 win was more than enough to push Borussia Monchengladbach into a Champions League spot with the German giants overcoming Wolfsburg. The away side put up quite a defensive fight but never had an offensive one despite 63 dangerous attacks. Instead, they came to absolutely nothing with just seven shots on goal and one on target from Wolfsburg.
In comparison, Gladbach managed 60 dangerous attacks but instead hit double figures for shots and found the target five times, with one goal. That came in the dying embers of the first half and while Wolfsburg put up a fight late in the second half, it was too little too late.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Barcelona 6-1 PSG: Emery rues ref, Suarez and 'hiding' PSG star as he reflects on collapse</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unai Emery hit out at referee Deniz Aytekin, Barcelona forward Luis Suarez and an un-named Paris Saint-Germain player as he reflected on the 6-1 Champions League collapse suffered at Camp Nou in 2017.
PSG, then coached by Emery, romped to a 4-0 win in the first leg of their last-16 tie, but on March 8, a day Emery remembers as the worst of his career, Barca recorded an unbelievable second-leg comeback.
Leading 3-1 on the night but still trailing 5-3 on aggregate after 88 minutes, Barca were on the brink of elimination.
However, they managed to score three times in a dramatic finale to seal the largest comeback in Champions League history, with future PSG star Neymar scoring twice for Luis Enrique's hosts.
Reflecting on the devastating loss more than three years later, Emery hit out at the performance of Turkish official Aytekin.
He also discussed his belief Suarez kept going down easily in the box and suggested there was a PSG player who was "hiding" as he explained the other circumstances that worked against his team.
"There are lots of details in that game that can be scrutinised," Emery said, per EFE, in a discussion with his former Sevilla assistant Diego Martinez, who now coaches Granada.
"But if I start from the end, I'd change the referee and that's it. I watched a repeat of the game the other day because I found it while I was zapping through channels. I watched it from the 50th minute to the 82nd minute.
"We were 3-0 down, we scored to make it 3-1 and we had a one-on-one that Edinson Cavani hit at the goalkeeper to make it 3-2; a clear penalty on Angel Di Maria that wasn't given; and in the 82nd minute, Di Maria fouled Neymar for the goal. That's when I stopped watching.
"In that section of the game, I saw that one of our important players, who had had injury problems during the season, was hiding in the result. Maybe I would substitute him now.
"They are details, circumstances that escape you in a game.
"Then there are other key circumstances: the Barcelona players, especially Suarez, going down in the box continuously, pressuring the referee until he fell into their trap."
Barca were knocked out in the by eventual finalists Juventus in the last eight.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jose Mourinho names the one defeat of his managerial career that made him cry</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jose Mourinho has confessed he was reduced to tears following Real Madrid’s emotional Champions League semi-final defeat at the hands of Bayern Munich.
The current Tottenham manager had built a star-studded side which briefly interrupted Barcelona’s dominance of La Liga under Pep Guardiola, ending the 2011/12 season as champions amassing 100 points and scoring an astonishing 121 goals in the process.
Mourinho’s team were considered favourites to double up and become kings of Europe too, particularly after Barcelona succumbed to a shock defeat against Chelsea who were managed by caretaker boss Roberto Di Matteo.
Real, meanwhile, needed to overturn a 2-1 first leg deficit at the Bernabeu to reach the final in Munich and looked well on their way when they raced into a two-goal lead thanks to a quickfire Cristiano Ronaldo double.
Arjen Robben, however, levelled the tie from the penalty spot before half-time and with no further addition to the scoreline, the match was settled in a shootout during which Ronaldo, Kaka and Sergio Ramos all failed to beat Manuel Neuer from 12 yards.
Recalling the pain of that particular defeat, Mourinho told Marca: ‘Cristiano, Kaka, Sergio Ramos… three complete monsters of football, there’s no doubt about that, but they’re also human.
‘That night is the only time in my career as a coach that I’ve cried after a defeat.
‘I remember it well. Aitor [Karanka] and I pulled up in front of my house, in the car, crying…”It was very hard because we were the best that season.’
Despite the anguish of that defeat, Mourinho still fondly remembers the success he masterminded during that record breaking season in the Spanish capital.
He added: ‘It’s very difficult for me to say if that was the high point or not. But since then, I’m sure that it was a very important moment because it came in a special period of dominance for Barcelona.
‘Ending that Barcelona dominance and doing it by achieving a record points tally and a record goals tally like that makes it even more interesting and important because we did it in the best way possible. It wasn’t only that we won LaLiga, it’s that we did it in a way that made history.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bayern Munich 2-1 Atletico Madrid: An Enthralling Tactical Clash Which Saw Diego Simeone & Atleti Prevail</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was a tactical tie for the ages.
Bayern Munich vs Atletico Madrid. Pep Guardiola vs Diego Simeone. Two contrasting football ideologies clashing for 180 minutes of intrigue with a place in the Champions League final on the line.
Heading into the second leg at the Allianz Arena in April 2016, Simeone's side held a slender 1-0 advantage following Saul Niguez's sensational solo strike after just 11 minutes. Los Rojiblancos' stellar defensive display for the remainder of the encounter, meanwhile, proved Pep's imperious Bayern side would have their work cut out in the return fixture.
Die Roten started brilliantly, however, sustaining attacks superbly and suffocating Atleti into oblivion with a fierce counter-press that came from all angles. Eventually, their pressure paid off before the break as Xabi Alonso's deflected free-kick found its way past Jan Oblak to restore parity in the tie.
The typically reliable Thomas Muller then had the chance from the spot to put Bayern 2-0 up on the night after Javi Martinez was pulled down by Jose Gimenez, but the German's penalty was saved by Oblak.
Then, eight minutes after the restart, Atleti got that crucial away goal. Gabi and Koke combined superbly to bypass three Bayern pressers to find Antoine Griezmann in a two-v-two alongside Fernando Torres. The Frenchman nodded Koke's deft lob down to Torres before the Spaniard split David Alaba and Martinez with a fantastic pass for Griezmann to latch onto in behind. Atleti's number seven's disguised finish was superb.
Bayern continued to impress going forward, though, and persistently asked questions of Simeone's robust backline. The positioning of Alaba and Philipp Lahm started to cause Atleti problems before the former played a big hand to give Bayern the lead on the night, as his cross from the left found Arturo Vidal who nodded across goal for Robert Lewandowski to pounce.
The hosts needed just one more.
It was the visitors, however, who had the best chance to put things beyond the hosts as they were awarded a penalty following Martinez's reckless challenge on a surging Torres. With Griezmann off the field, Torres stepped up but his tame effort from 12 yards was palmed away at ease by Manuel Neuer.
A Bayern onslaught for the remaining ten minutes ensued, but a combination of safe goalkeeping, poor decision-making by Kingsley Coman and Atleti's capacity to defend the box ensured Die Roten didn't snatch an all-important third, meaning Simeone's side progressed on away goals.
Bayern were totally superior on the night and couldn't have done too much more to progress into the final.
Pep's idea to deploy wingers on their traditional flanks in a bid to outfox Atleti's compactness blunted the Bayern attack for much of the first leg and they were much more threatening with the use of inverted wingers in this one.
With Franck Ribery on the left and Douglas Costa on the right, there was greater scope for the pair to drift in between the lines and occupy the half-spaces, all while Alaba and Lahm overlapped - or underlapped, depending on the positioning of the winger - from their full back roles.
While there was minimal space to work between the lines, the dynamic movement of both full backs and Bayern's capacity to overload the flanks meant they were a constant menace from wide areas.
Their performance in the first phase was superb and although they found it tough to penetrate centrally, there's little doubting they created enough to win by a bigger margin on the night.
Starting XI: Neuer (7); Lahm (7), Boateng (8), Martinez (6), Alaba (8); Alonso (9), Vidal (6); Costa (4), Muller (5), Ribery (7); Lewandowski (6).
Substitutes: Coman (5).
It's a pleasure for one to cast their eyes on this man's performance on the second viewing.
The Spaniard was simply sensational in all phases of play, dropping into a back three to assist Bayern's progression through the first phase and serving as his side's quarterback as the ball progressed into Atleti's half.
Out of possession he proved key in ensuring the visitors didn't enjoy any sustained spells with the ball as his astute and incredibly intense pressing just after Bayern had lost possession overwhelmed the visitors' midfield, forcing quick turnovers and allowing his side to sustain attacks. His perfect positional play, meanwhile, also prevented Griezmann and Torres from seeing much of the ball.
Oh, and he got on the score sheet as well.
This wasn't Simeone's Atletico at their robust best, but it was pretty damn close.
Set-up in a typical 4-4-2 mid block, their vertical and lateral compactness ensured Bayern's attacking midfielders struggled to affect proceedings from between the lines, as they persistently failed to combine off one or two touches.
Gabi, meanwhile, did a fine job in trying to disrupt Vidal in possession as he constantly moved out of the midfield line to hassle the Chilean and prevent Bayern from penetrating centrally. The speed at which they returned to their settled shape after committing men forward to support the front two was remarkable as well.
Overall, they seemed content allowing the hosts attack from out wide or via the direct route through Lewandowski. And with the full backs narrow, they were well-prepared to deal with an aerial bombardment into the penalty area.
While they surrendered chances, rode their luck, scored with their only real chance and forced Oblak into making nine saves on the night, Atleti's defence proved stern enough as Simeone sh*thoused his way to another Champions League final.
Starting XI: Oblak (8); Juanfran (7), Gimenez (7), Godin (8), Luis (7); Saul (7), Gabi (7), Fernandez (5), Koke (8); Griezmann (7), Torres (6).
Substitutes: Carrasco (7), Partey (6), Savic (N/A).
Simeone's Swiss Army knife proved key in this one.
Initially starting out on the left, Koke was drafted into the middle for the second half - where he proved a demon out of possession. When his side dropped into a 4-5-1 low block later on in proceedings, the Spaniard was tasked with stepping out to support Torres with the first press as well as provide cover for Bayern's crosses at the other end of the pitch.
He covered every blade of the Allianz turf and his moment of composure in possession kick-started the counter which led to Atleti's crucial away goal.
Yannick Carrasco's introduction at the break proved a significant one.
The Belgian provided the visitors with a little more thrust in transition as well as an aerial threat when they went long. His ability in tight spaces also allowed him to carry the ball up the pitch and draw fouls, providing Atleti with moments of mental and physical respite in the second period.
The 26-year-old would then score his side's equaliser in the final, celebrating in the most audacious way possible by kissing his girlfriend in the stands.
From playing a key role in the latter stages of this European run, Carrasco drifted into obscurity as he made the move to China in 2018 before returning on loan to Los Rojiblancos in January 2020.
Heard of this Thomas Partey fella who's rose to prominence over the past 12 months?
Thought you might.
Well, the Ghanaian was only good enough for a ten minute cameo in this one as Simeone looked to shut up shop. He's now one of Europe's most complete central midfielders and is poised for a career spent in the colours of some of the continent's elite.
That would be Pep's final European encounter in the home dugout at the Allianz as he made the switch to the sky blue side of Manchester at the end of the campaign...and he's still yet to win a Champions League crown without Lionel Messi.
He would, however, ensure he won the Bundesliga title in every season during his stint in Munich as Bayern outlasted Dortmund for their third Meisterschale on the bounce.
Atletico, meanwhile, would go on to lose to Real Madrid, again, in the final at San Siro on penalties, with Cristiano Ronaldo haunting the Rojiblancos faithful once more as he smashed home the winning spot-kick.
They'd also have to settle for third in La Liga behind the Clásico participants.
Seriously Simeone, other than cajones, how do you do it?
Are Pep's Bayern the best side not to win the Champions League?
Was Javi Martinez's foul on Fernando Torres in or outside the box - it's not significant, just bloody hard to tell?!

    <h5 class="mb-1">VIDEO: Roma v Inter goal fest</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In May 1999, Inter overcame AS Roma 5-4 after a thriller at the Stadio Olimpico. Ronaldo and Ivan Zamorano netted two goals apiece, before Diego Simeone scored a late winner.
Many people say that Serie A games always end 0-0 or 1-0, but Roma and Inter Milan proved that is not always the case when the two clubs met back in 1999. 
Inter Milan were 0-2 and 1-3 up in the first half before Roma pulled it back to 3-3. Inter went back ahead courtesy of Ronaldo before former Roma boss Eusebio di Francesco levelled the scores again in the 79th minute. Diego Simeone had the last laugh though as he made it 4-5 three minutes from the end. Check out the highlights below!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN: All table tennis competitions and events have been scrapped at least until the end of July due to the coronavirus, the international table tennis federation (ITTF) said on Saturday.
Following an update from its task force the ITTF said it was looking into potentially returning to action in August but would also need to cut costs.
"The current period of suspension of all ITTF events and activities has been extended up until the end of July 2020," it said in a statement.
"The situation is being monitored closely for an eventual restart of ITTF events in August 2020."
It said it was also cancelling all veterans tour events and Table Tennis X events for the entire year while looking into cost-cutting measures to meet the financial challenges.
"ITTF management have been asked to find ways to reduce operation costs overall, including the need for there to be some HR restructure in order to manage 2020 financial realities," it said.
The virus has wreaked havoc with the international sports calendar, forcing also the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and the Euro 2020 soccer championships to 2021.
But it has also cut deep into international federations' finances putting their future operations in doubt.

    <h5 class="mb-1">USA Women's claims for equal pay dismissed by court</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The USA women's national soccer team's claims for equal pay have been dismissed by a court in America.
A judge in California threw out players' claims they were underpaid in comparison with the men's national team but allowed complaints of unfair medical, travel and training to proceed to trial.
Players had been seeking $66m in damages under the Equal Pay Act, claiming they have been subject to ongoing institutionalised gender discrimination, including unequal pay, despite having the same job responsibilities as the men's national players.
"The WNT (Women's National Team) has been paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the MNT (Men's National Team) over the class period," the court said in its summary judgement.
Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the players, said that they plan to appeal the decision.
The team's co-captain Megan Rapinoe has vowed she will never give up the fight after a federal judge threw out their claims.
The 34-year-old, who won the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball at the 2019 Women's World Cup, has been a leading voice in the fight against US Soccer.
Rapinoe, a two-time World Cup winner, tweeted: "We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY."
USA Women beat the Netherlands to claim a fourth World Cup title last summer making them the most successful side in history.
The judge, however, ruled that players' claims they do not receive equal treatment as the men when it comes to travel, training, housing and other areas could proceed.
The trial date is set for June 16.
Levinson said: "We are shocked and disappointed with today's decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay.
"We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.
"We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them.
"We will appeal and press on. Words cannot express our gratitude to all who support us."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled against the United States women’s national soccer team and its demands for equal pay.
The California judge ruled in favor of the United States Soccer Federation on most of the key points in the ongoing wage discrimination lawsuit. Led by Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, the players alleged the federation discriminated against them under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In the end, the judge ruled that the players “have not demonstrated a triable issue that WNT players are paid less than MNT players.” According to ESPN, USWNT players actually earned more in total and on a per-game basis than their male counterparts.
After the ruling, players like Rapinoe and Morgan made their displeasure with the ruling known.
“Although disappointing to hear this news, this will not discourage us in our fight for equality,” she said.
USWNT spokesperson Molly Levinson released a statement about the ruling.
“We are shocked and disappointed with today’s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay. We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.”
The fight for equal pay rolls on for the USWNT.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. women’s soccer team’s claims for equal pay were dismissed by a court on Friday, handing a victory to the United States Soccer Federation. 
Judge R. Gary Klausner of the United States District Court for the Central District of California threw out players’ claims that they were under paid in comparison with the men’s national team but allowed complaints of unfair medical, travel and training to proceed to trial.
“The WNT (Women’s National Team) has been paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the MNT (Men’s National Team) over the class period,” the court said in its summary judgment.
The judge, however, also ruled that players’ claims they do not receive equal treatment as the men when it comes to travel, training, housing and other areas could proceed.
The trial date is set for June 16.
Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the players, said that they plan to appeal the decision.
“We are shocked and disappointed,” said Levinson. “We will not give up our hard work for equal pay.
“We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.”
U.S. Soccer released a statement Friday saying it wanted to work with the team to “chart a positive path forward to grow the game both here at home and around the world.”
“U.S. Soccer has long been the world leader for the women’s game on and off the field and we are committed to continuing that work,” the federation said.
Players had been seeking $66 million in damages under the Equal Pay Act.
The women’s national team beat Netherlands to claim its fourth World Cup title last summer, as the stadium rang with chants of, “Equal Pay, Equal Pay,” catapulting its players into the spotlight.
Team co-captain Megan Rapinoe, who on Thursday appeared with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in a livestreamed event tweeted: “We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY.”
Forward Tobin Heath wrote on social media: “This team never gives up and we’re not going to start now.”
The U.S national team’s long-running feud with U.S. Soccer has been a very public and bitter battle with athletes and celebrities, from Billie Jean King to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rallying around the women’s cause.
Last month U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro resigned over language used in a court filing suggesting women possess less ability than men when it comes to soccer.
The language prompted an on-field protest by players, who wore their warmup jerseys inside out to obscure the U.S. Soccer logo prior to a game, and a critical response from several of the team’s commercial sponsors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">USWNT unable to demonstrate they were illegally paid less than men, judge rules</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A federal judge issued a ruling late Friday hampering the United States women's national soccer team's lawsuit which claims the U.S. Soccer Federation violated the Equal Pay Act by paying them less than members of the men's national team.
Judge R. Gary Klausner ruled the plaintiffs were not able to demonstrate they were paid less than their male counterparts between 2015 and 2019 "due solely, or in material part, to the WNT working more than the MNT." Klasuner sided with U.S. Soccer which has said the USWNT was paid more overall during that time frame. The women said that was only because they played more games than the men, but Klausner's ruling cited as undisputed fact that the USWNT averaged more per game, as well.
Klausner said the EPA claims were ultimately rejected because of differences in the men's and women's collective bargaining agreements, noting the women rejected a pay-for-play model identical to the men in 2016, eventually offering a counterproposal with lesser bonuses (which the men rely on for their national team compensation) than the federation's offer in exchange for more contracted players and higher base salaries.
The judge also sided in part with U.S. Soccer in response to the plaintiffs' claim they were discriminated against by being subjected to playing on inferior surfaces.
Klausner's explanation didn't satisfy the plaintiffs. Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the women, said they were "shocked and disappointed with today's decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay." USWNT player Megan Rapinoe voiced her agreement over Twitter. Tim O'Donnell

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus outbreak: Labuschagne ready for 'heaps of cricket' when sport resumes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australia's Marnus Labuschagne is bracing for "heaps and heaps of cricket" once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the prolific top order batsman said on Saturday.
The global health crisis has halted international sports, postponing several bilateral cricket series and jeopardising this year's Twenty20 World Cup scheduled in October-November in Australia.
"There is going to be a lot of tours that will need to be made up," Labuschagne told Australian Associated Press (AAP).
"There's going to be a whole heap of cricket in a very short time frame. We'll be making up for missed time, that schedule is just going to be packed.
"It's going to be a bit different to what we're used to. We're going to have to be ready coming out of this break to play heaps and heaps of cricket."
The South Africa-born Labuschagne is probably best prepared for such a scenario, having been adjudged the busiest cricketer in an ESPNcricinfo analysis last October.
The 25-year-old has been a revelation since stepping up as Steve Smith’s concussion substitute at Lord’s in last year's Ashes series in England.
In the subsequent series against Pakistan and New Zealand, the right-hander smashed four centuries in five tests, including a maiden double hundred in Sydney earlier this year.
Labuschagne felt his Glamorgan stint helped him get better as a batsman and lamented not being able to reunite with the county as professional cricket remains suspended in England until at least July 1.
"I really enjoyed it last year. I loved Glamorgan, hence why I signed a two-year extension," he said.
"It's disappointing to see them and England cricket in trouble. It's our responsibility, cricket on the whole, to make sure once this period is over that we get games on television and get the sport started again. We need to support each other."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marnus Labuschagne expecting packed schedule once cricket resumes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australian run-machine Marnus Labuschagne is gearing up for a packed schedule to make up for the time lost due to the COVID-19pandemic once cricket resumes.
All cricket is on hold right now due to the pandemic sweeping through the globe with several tours and tournaments being either cancelled or postponed.
“There is going to be a lot of tours that will need to be made up,” Labuschgne told Australian Associated Press.
“There’s going to be a whole heap of cricket in a very short time frame. We’ll be making up for missed time, that schedule is just going to be packed.”
Australia’s ODI series against New Zealand was called off after the first match, while the T20 World Cup is facing an uncertain future.
With several tours being rescheduled in an already congested calendar, Laubuschagne feels players will be expected to play a lot more than usual.
“It’s going to be a bit different to what we’re used to. We’re going to have to be ready coming out of this break to play heaps and heaps of cricket.”
The 25-year-old, who rose to fame after coming in as Steve Smith’s concussion substitute in the Ashes last year, is disappointed to see the English county season also suffer.
“It’s very sad. I really enjoyed it last year. I loved Glamorgan, hence why I signed a two-year extension. It’s disappointing to see them and England cricket in trouble,” he said.
Several boards like Cricket Australia are facing a financial crisis and the youngster feels the entire cricket community should come together and do whatever is in their hands to get the sport going again.
“It’s our responsibility, cricket on the whole, to make sure once this period is over that we get games on television and get the sport started again. We need to support each other,” he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: Labuschagne expects packed schedule once cricket resumes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sydney: Australian run machine Marnus Labuschagne is gearing up for a packed schedule to make up for the time lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic once cricket resumes.
All cricket is on hold right now due to the pandemic sweeping through the globe with several tours and tournaments being either cancelled or postponed.
“There is going to be a lot of tours that will need to be made up,” Labuschgne said.
“There’s going to be a whole heap of cricket in a very short time frame. We’ll be making up for missed time, that schedule is just going to be packed.”
Australia’s ODI series against New Zealand was called off after the first match, while the T20 World Cup is facing an uncertain future.
With several tours being rescheduled in an already congested calender, Laubuschagne feels players will be expected to play a lot more than usual.
“It’s going to be a bit different to what we’re used to. We’re going to have to be ready coming out of this break to play heaps and heaps of cricket.”
The 25-year-old, who rose to fame after coming in as Steve Smith’s concussion substitute in the Ashes last year, is disappointed to see the English county season also suffer.
“It’s very sad. I really enjoyed it last year. I loved Glamorgan, hence why I signed a two-year extension. It’s disappointing to see them and England cricket in trouble,” he said.
Several boards like Cricket Australia are facing a financial crisis and the youngster feels the entire cricket community should come together and do whatever is in their hands to get the sport going again.
“It’s our responsibility, cricket on the whole, to make sure once this period is over that we get games on television and get the sport started again. We need to support each other,” he added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australian batsman Marnus Labuschagne expects the cricketing schedule to be packed once action resumes after the Covid-19 pandemic subsides.
Professional sport all over the globe ground to a halt after the coronavirus, which started in the Wuhan province of China, began to spread its tentacles.
Cricket has been no exception with several bilateral series being postponed, while the Twenty20 World Cup scheduled to take place in October-November in Australia is in jeopardy of being cancelled.
"There is going to be a lot of tours that will need to be made up," Labuschagne told Australian Associated Press (AAP).
"There's going to be a whole heap of cricket in a very short time frame. We'll be making up for missed time, that schedule is just going to be packed. It's going to be a bit different to what we're used to. We're going to have to be ready coming out of this break to play heaps and heaps of cricket."
South African-born Labuschagne would have currently been playing county cricket with Glamorgan and hopes the global health crisis will not impact the sport negatively.
"I really enjoyed it last year. I loved Glamorgan, hence why I signed a two-year extension," he said.
"It's disappointing to see them and England cricket in trouble. It's our responsibility, cricket on the whole, to make sure once this period is over that we get games on television and get the sport started again. We need to support each other."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cricket will be making up for missed times, vouches Marnus Labuschagne</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Since making his appearance as a concussion substitute, Marnus Labuschagne has grown in tremendous nature to become one of the best batsmen in world cricket. Incidentally, it was Labuschagne’s team that played the last international game against New Zealand before cricket came to a halt. 
Following the halt, Marnus Labuschagne has now vouched that cricket will be making up for the missed times. The Queenslander added that he believes that there will be more tours accommodated when international cricket resumes in the near future. 
"There is going to be a lot of tours that will need to be made up. There's going to be a whole heap of cricket in a very short time frame. We'll be making up for missed time, that schedule is just going to be packed," Labuschgne told Australian Associated Press, reported TOI. 
The right-hander also was left disappointed seeing English cricket in trouble after the county season did not start on time. Labuchagne recalled the time he spent with Glamorgan, which made him into a world-beater. 
"It's very sad. I really enjoyed it last year. I loved Glamorgan, hence why I signed a two-year extension. It's disappointing to see them and England cricket in trouble," he added. 
However, the South Africa-born cricketer asserted that it's the cricketing fraternity's responsibility to make sure cricketing action reaches to the people once the COVID-19 struck period gets over. 
"It's going to be a bit different to what we're used to. We're going to have to be ready coming out of this break to play heaps and heaps of cricket. It's our responsibility, cricket on the whole, to make sure once this period is over that we get games on television and get the sport started again. We need to support each other,” he concluded.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australia's Marnus Labuschagne is bracing for "heaps and heaps of cricket" once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the prolific top order batsman said on Saturday.
SYDNEY: Australia's Marnus Labuschagne is bracing for "heaps and heaps of cricket" once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the prolific top order batsman said on Saturday.
The global health crisis has halted international sports, postponing several bilateral cricket series and jeopardising this year's Twenty20 World Cup scheduled in October-November in Australia.
"There is going to be a lot of tours that will need to be made up," Labuschagne told Australian Associated Press (AAP).
"There's going to be a whole heap of cricket in a very short time frame. We'll be making up for missed time, that schedule is just going to be packed.
"It's going to be a bit different to what we're used to. We're going to have to be ready coming out of this break to play heaps and heaps of cricket."
The South Africa-born Labuschagne is probably best prepared for such a scenario, having been adjudged the busiest cricketer in an ESPNcricinfo analysis last October.
The 25-year-old has been a revelation since stepping up as Steve Smith’s concussion substitute at Lord’s in last year's Ashes series in England.
In the subsequent series against Pakistan and New Zealand, the right-hander smashed four centuries in five tests, including a maiden double hundred in Sydney earlier this year.
Labuschagne felt his Glamorgan stint helped him get better as a batsman and lamented not being able to reunite with the county as professional cricket remains suspended in England until at least July 1.
"I really enjoyed it last year. I loved Glamorgan, hence why I signed a two-year extension," he said.
"It's disappointing to see them and England cricket in trouble. It's our responsibility, cricket on the whole, to make sure once this period is over that we get games on television and get the sport started again. We need to support each other."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Discus thrower Sandeep Kumari has been slapped with a four-year ban by the Athletics Integrity Unit for flunking a dope test, nearly two years after her sample was deemed clean by the NDTL.
The National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL) had failed to detect the banned substance -- a steroid -- which was present in her blood sample, collected by NADA officials during the National Inter-State Championships in June 2018 in Guwahati.
Kumari had won the gold with a throw of 58.41m.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) then decided to test the sample of Kumari at its Montreal Laboratory in Canada and it returned positive for anabolic steroid Metenolone in November 2018.
Explore Briefs
Kumari's results from June 26, 2018 to November 21, 2018 will now be annulled.
Her four-year ban, announced by WADA on Friday night, will begin from June 26, 2018 -- the date of her sample collection.
Not only Kumari's but samples of four other Indians, including 2017 Asian champion quarter-miler Nirmala Sheoran's had returned negative at NDTL but were found positive when tested in Montreal.
Jhuma Khatun, one of them, was also handed a four-year ban, last month.
WADA referred Kumari's results management to the AIU which notified her of the charges and provisionally suspended her in November 2018.
The Haryana athlete waived her right for the confirmatory 'B' sample test and accepted the adverse analytical finding (AAF).
In February 2019, Kumari participated in an interview with representatives of AIU by phone during which she confirmed that she admitted the Anti-Doping Rule Violations (ADRV).
In February 2020, the AIU issued a notice of charge to Kumari, asking her to either admit the ADRV or undergo a hearing before the Disciplinary Tribunal.
After missing three deadlines to respond, Kumari finally accepted the charge and did not request a hearing.

In February 2019, Kumari participated in an interview with representatives of AIU by phone during which she confirmed that she admitted the Anti-Doping Rule Violations.
In February 2020, the AIU issued a notice of charge to Kumari, asking her to either admit the ADRV or undergo a hearing before the Disciplinary Tribunal. After missing three deadlines to respond, Kumari finally accepted the charge and did not request a hearing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Discus Thrower Sandeep Kumari Gets 4-year Ban For Failing Dope Test</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Discus thrower Sandeep Kumari has been slapped with a four-year ban by WADA’s Athletics Integrity Unit for flunking a dope test , nearly two years after her sample was deemed clean by the NDTL. The National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL) had failed to detect the banned substance — a steroid — which was present in her blood sample, collected by NADA officials during the National Inter-State Championships in June 2018 in Guwahati.

Kumari had won the gold with a throw of 58.41m. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) then decided to test the sample of Kumari at its Montreal Laboratory in Canada and it returned positive for anabolic steroid Metenolone in November 2018.

Her four-year ban, announced by WADA on Friday night, will begin from June 26, 2018 — the date of her sample collection.
Not only Kumari’s but samples of four other Indians, including 2017 Asian champion quarter-miler Nirmala Sheoran’s had returned negative at NDTL but were found positive when tested in Montreal.
Jhuma Khatun, one of them, was also handed a four-year ban, last month.
WADA referred Kumari’s results management to the AIU which notified her of the charges and provisionally suspended her in November 2018.
The Haryana athlete waived her right for the confirmatory ‘B’ sample test and accepted the adverse analytical finding (AAF).
In February 2019, Kumari participated in an interview with representatives of AIU by phone during which she confirmed that she admitted the Anti-Doping Rule Violations (ADRV).
In February 2020, the AIU issued a notice of charge to Kumari, asking her to either admit the ADRV or undergo a hearing before the Disciplinary Tribunal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Olympic rower joins fight against coronavirus as junior doctor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An Olympic rower has joined the fight against coronavirus as a junior doctor, while still training for the postponed games.
Olympic silver medallist Polly Swann started working as a junior doctor last week after previously completing her medical degree.
The 31-year-old won a silver medal as part of the women’s eight at the 2016 games in Rio de Janeiro.
She joined a hospital in Scotland to aid the fight against coronavirus last week, and will work there for the next three months.
Dr Swann said: “A lot of junior doctors have been moved to the most critical parts of the NHS, so interim foundation year doctors are backfilling their roles.
“I’m definitely not a frontline ICU worker, but I’m glad I can still help to ease the burden in some way.”
She added her coach Tom Pattichis has devised a training programme to prepare her for the Olympic games outside of her working hours.
“I had the experience of training alongside working when I was in my last few months of medical school last year so it’s not entirely new to me,” she said.
“I’m staying with my parents for lockdown so I have a rowing machine in their hallway, some dumbbells in the living room and a wattbike in my dad’s toolshed, which I’m sure is very annoying for them.”
She said: “The Olympics is a celebration of human achievement and it brings people together – it’s about more than just medals and more than even sport.
“If everyone can come together for this celebration at the end of all this it’ll be the most phenomenal Olympics ever.”
Director of performance Brendan Purcell said: “We’re pleased to be able to support Polly in balancing her training for the postponed Tokyo 2020 Games alongside her work as a junior doctor.
“Since the start of the pandemic we have discussed with athletes and staff how we can combine our pursuit of performance excellence alongside our social responsibility in this current crisis.
“As well as the fact that Polly will be contributing to the nationwide NHS effort, our approach aims to centre on developing the person and athlete to enable them to thrive now and in their careers beyond sport.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United star Daniel James reacts to Gareth Bale comparisons</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United star Daniel James has paid tribute to Wales team-mate Gareth Bale and insists he cannot be compared to the Real Madrid man so early in his career.
James completed a £15million move to Old Trafford last summer and had largely impressed under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer before the 2019-20 season was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The 22-year-old scored three goals in his first four appearances for Manchester United, impressing fans with his speed and technical ability.
James was even likened to four-time Champions League winner Bale by some fans but says such comparisons are ‘silly’.
Bale has scored more than 100 goals for Real Madrid since leaving Premier League club Tottenham in 2013 and has been Wales’ talisman for over a decade.
‘I don’t think you can compare me to him with what he’s done,’ James told Sky Sports.
‘Hes been amazing with Wales, he’s such a great guy and just normal. He’s great with the youngsters and great around the group.
‘To compare me to him is a bit too much I think. Look what he’s done in his career, like winning the Champions League, it’s amazing what he’s done.
‘You definitely look up to players like him. But being compared to him is a bit silly.’
James, who started his professional career at Swansea City, has already made 37 appearances for Manchester United, who are currently fifth in the Premier League.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United player Daniel James reacts to Gareth Bale comparisons</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United winger Daniel James says it is 'silly' for him to be compared to Gareth Bale.
James, 22, joined United from Swansea City for £15million rising to £18m at the start of last summer despite having never played in the Premier League, but has enjoyed an encouraging first season in the top flight.
Bale, 30, was on the brink of leaving Real Madrid for Chinese Super League club Jiangsu Suning in July but is still at the Bernabeu nearly seven years on from a world record £85m move from Tottenham.
The Wales international has lifted four Champions Leagues, four Club World Cups, the Copa del Rey and La Liga title in a trophy-laden career in Spain, but Bale's reluctance to assimilate to Spanish culture has driven a wedge between him and Madrid fans.
James is expected to line up alongside Bale at the European Championship next year but literally laughed at the comparison between the pair.
"I don't think you can compare me to him, what he's done," James told Sky Sports. "To play with him at Wales is obviously amazing. Anyone that doesn't know him, he's such a great guy and just a normal guy, really. He's great with the youngsters, he's great around the place, but to be compared with him is a bit too much, I think.
"For what he's done in his career, how he went from a left-back to a left midfielder to win the Champions League, it's just amazing. Players like him, you obviously look up to, but I think being compared to him is a bit silly."
United wanted to sign Bale from Southampton in 2007 but the Saints accepted a bid from Spurs without informing a miffed Sir Alex Ferguson. Bale claimed the PFA Player of the Year award on two occasions with Spurs before he left for Madrid in 2013.
Despite the inevitability of a move to Madrid, United offered £86m for Bale seven years ago and were keen on signing him in 2017 but received little encouragement from the Welshman's camp.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Australians' path to the Premier League has never been tougher</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A former Premier League head of recruitment believes it's now harder than ever for Australian soccer players to make it to the English top-flight. It's been more than a decade since the Socceroos' golden generation started to fade away and there's been few signs of a return to those halcyon days of the mid-to-late 2000s.
At the 2006 World Cup, nine of Australia's 23-man squad represented Premier League sides, with four others plying their trade in the Spanish La Liga and Serie A in Italy. In stark contrast, at last year's Asian Cup, Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan was the only player contracted to an EPL team, although Aaron Mooy, then of Huddersfield, would have been in the squad had it not been for injury.
There have been a string of theories put forward for the reason behind Australia's well of talent drying up. One is the decision of the FFA in 2017 to shut down the centre of excellence at the Australian Institute of Sport that produced the likes of Craig Moore, Vince Grella, Mark Viduka, Lucas Neill, Brett Emerton, Mark Bresciano, Vince Grella and John Aloisi.
Another is the replacement of home-grown coaches like Ron Smith and Steve O'Connor in Canberra more 10 years ago with ones from the Netherlands in a failed attempt to emulate the successful Dutch system.
Gary Penrice, former head of recruitment at Everton, Crystal Palace, Blackpool, QPR, Wigan and Stoke, who's just been appointed by Celtic, believes making the grade in England is tough, but not necessarily because of a lack of talent.
"Sometimes it just happens, a glut of really good players come through at once," Penrice said. "We're seeing it with Wales at the moment who have young kids like Daniel James now playing for Man United and Harry Wilson, who's on loan at Bournemouth from Liverpool.
"Who knows, in four years' time we could be talking about it happening again with Australia. But the football world is so vast nowadays. You now have players coming from so many different parts of the world to play in the Premier League."
There have been 51 Aussies who've played in the Premier League since its formation in 1992, which ranks only behind Brazil, Argentina and Nigeria for a non-European nation.
"There's always been lots of good players from Scandinavia and Australia but now you have players from countries like Liberia, Tanzania and Gabon, the net of talent is wider than ever," Penrice said. "I was at Palace when Mile Jedinak was there. A terrific guy, great pro and a real leader of men.
"You can say the same about Tim Cahill when I was at Everton. Both fantastic players, but also dependable, strong, good to have around your squad. That is always what Australian players have brought to a team."
Penrice said the progress of Mooy and Ryan shows good Aussies can still break through. "I first watched Mooy in a World Cup warm-up match against Czech Republic and he was the best player on the pitch," he said. "Clubs will always want to sign players like him and Ryan."
The improvement in young English talent has also hindered Aussie players in academy systems like Aiden O'Neill, on loan to Brisbane Roar from Burnley, making the grade like Kewell did at Leeds.
A change to the rules for overseas signings also means EPL clubs must now splash out to be guaranteed a work permit. Previously, a permit would be granted for any player who'd played 75 per cent of their country's international fixtures over three years. Now, only a player who costs STG10 million and earns STG30,000 a week will be given the green light under a points system.
"It's certainly made things harder," Penrice said. "It'll be interesting to see what happens with Australia. Young (Daniel) Arzani has been at Celtic, but he's not played much due to the injury he had. Arzani is Manchester City's player ... they obviously think he's got something to have signed him. But he needs to play games. I am guessing they'll loan him out again."
GOALKEEPER:
Mark Bosnich
Manchester United 1988-91, 1999-01, Aston Villa 1992-99, Chelsea 2001-02
Appearances: 273
Hard to split Bosnich and Mark Schwarzer, but the Sydneysider's brilliance during a six-year spell for teams competing for honours gives him the edge. Villa were a frequent top-four challenger with 'Bozza' between the sticks, won two cups and regularly played in Europe. He returned to United to win the EPL in 2000 before off-field dramas ultimately ended his career. Although it tainted his legacy, there's no disputing, at his pomp, Bosnich was among the finest keepers in Britain.
DEFENDERS:
Brett Emerton
Blackburn Rovers 2003-2011
Appearances: 294
Goals: 20
The $A4.8 million spent by Blackburn on Emerton is regarded as one of the best value-for-money signings in the club's history. Marked his debut with a goal and an assist and became one of the EPL's best attacking full-backs. Respected for his low maintenance attitude off the field too, Emerton appeared in two FA Cups and a League Cup semi-final. He was also part of a squad that qualified twice for the Europa League.
Lucas Neill
Millwall 1995-2001, Blackburn '01-07, West Ham '07-'09, Everton, 09-10, Watford, Doncaster 2014.
Appearances: 514
Goals: 22
Confident, abrasive, consistent. Three words that best describe Neill's stellar 19-year career in England. After six seasons at Millwall he became a Premier League player with Blackburn in 2001. The right-back's good form often saw him linked with a move to a top-four club. However, he turned down Liverpool in 2007 to join West Ham for a reported $150,000 a week. After three good seasons he left to join Everton only to depart after six months. After spells in Turkey and the A-League he joined Watford then Doncaster in 2014 before retiring after missing out on the World Cup.
Craig Moore
Glasgow Rangers 1993-98, '99-05, Crystal Palace 1998-'99, Newcastle 2005-07.
Appearances: 306
Goals: 20
A classy centre-back with a touch of steel, Moore enjoyed a trophy-laden 12-year stint with Rangers where he cemented his place in an outstanding side that featured regularly in the Champions League and won the Scottish treble in 2003. Newcastle gave Moore the chance to play in the Premier League in 2005 and he impressed the St James' Park crowd. However, injuries limited him to just 30 games in two years.
Joe Marston
Club: Preston North End 1950-55
Appearances: 185
The pioneering Sydneysider was the defensive linchpin in a fine Preston team. Signed in 1950, Marston was not only the first Australian to play in England but also the FA Cup final. He was a key man in the team that were denied the 1953 First Division title on goal average. Finished his career at Deepdale by being serenaded from the field to the tune of Waltzing Matilda. Named one of the club's six greatest-ever players last year.
MIDFIELDERS:
Craig Johnston
Clubs: Middlesbrough 1977-81, Liverpool 1981-1988
Number of all competition appearances: 335
Goals: 56
An outstanding attacking midfielder and a regular member of a magnificent Liverpool side in the early 1980s. What he lacked in technical ability, he made up for with an eye for goal, pace and power. Despite an outgoing personality, Johnston was constantly wracked with self-doubt and even went as far to claim he was the worst player in a fantastic team. He wasn't.
Mile Jedinak
Crystal Palace 2011-16, Aston Villa 2016-19
Appearances: 257
Goals: 12
Robbie Slater became the first Australian to win a Premier League title in 1995 at Blackburn and enjoyed spells at West Ham and Southampton. However, he's edged out by former Socceroos skipper Jedinak. The defensive midfielder was an inspirational captain at Palace and played a significant role in their promotion to the EPL in 2014. After helping them stay there, he led the Eagles out for the 2016 FA Cup final. Joined Villa later that year and won promotion again in 2019.
Tim Cahill
Millwall 1998-2004, 2019; Everton 2004-2012
Appearances: 453
Goals: 108
In addition to being a Socceroos great, Cahill is held in similarly-high esteem at Millwall and Everton. Signed for just $A3.8 million by the Toffees, in an eight-year stint he regularly topped their scoring charts. Scored in three successive World Cups for Australia and joined some exalted company by appearing in his fourth in 2018.
Stan Lazaridis
West Ham 1995-99, Birmingham City 1999-2006
Appearances: 260
Goals: 11
The flying left-winger endured a mixed time during his spell with West Ham, but found his feet at Birmingham where he became a huge crowd favourite. Scored a penalty in a shoot-out win that earned EPL promotion in 2002, ending a 17-year top-flight absence.
STRIKERS:
Harry Kewell
Leeds United 1996-2003; Liverpool 2003-2008
Appearances: 274
Goals: 56
The most naturally-talented player produced by Australia. Injuries blighted the attacker's Liverpool career, forcing him off during the 2005 Champions League and 2006 FA Cup finals. It was at Leeds where his star shone brightest in a brilliant side that reached the 2001 Champions League semi-final. However, some disparaging comments when he left for Anfield and a later move to Galatasaray tarnished his reputation with Leeds fans.
Mark Viduka
Leeds United 2000-2004 Middlesbrough 2004-07, Newcastle 2007-09
Appearances: 240
Goals: 62
Scored 30 goals in 37 games for Celtic before joining Leeds where he etched his named in club folklore by smashing four goals past Liverpool. Unlike Kewell, he is still revered at Elland Road. Viduka was a top-class striker blessed with an immaculate first touch, aerial ability and was a great finisher. Also enjoyed good success at Middlesbrough where he spearheaded their run to the Europa League final. Joined Newcastle in 2007 but injuries blighted his two years at the club.

Gary Penrice, former head of recruitment at Everton, Crystal Palace, Blackpool, QPR, Wigan and Stoke, who’s just been appointed by Celtic, believes making the grade in England is tough, but not necessarily because of a lack of talent.
“Sometimes it just happens, a glut of really good players come through at once,” Penrice told AAP.
“We’re seeing it with Wales at the moment who have young kids like Daniel James now playing for Man United and Harry Wilson, who’s on loan at Bournemouth from Liverpool.
“Who knows, in four years time we could be talking about it happening again with Australia. But the football world is so vast nowadays.
“You now have players coming from so many different parts of the world to play in the Premier League.”
There have been 51 Aussies who’ve played in the Premier League since its formation in 1992, which ranks only behind Brazil, Argentina and Nigeria for a non-European nation.
“There’s always been lots of good players from Scandinavia and Australia but now you have players from countries like Liberia, Tanzania and Gabon, the net of talent is wider than ever,” Penrice said.
“I was at Palace when Mile Jedinak was there. A terrific guy, great pro and a real leader of men.
“You can say the same about Tim Cahill when I was at Everton.
“Both fantastic players, but also dependable, strong, good to have around your squad. That is always what Australian players have brought to a team.”
Penrice said the progress of Mooy and Ryan shows good Aussies can still break through.
“I first watched Mooy in a World Cup warm-up match against Czech Republic and he was the best player on the pitch.
“Clubs will always want to sign players like him and Ryan.”
The improvement in young English talent has also hindered Aussie players in academy systems like Aiden O’Neill, on loan to Brisbane Roar from Burnley, making the grade like Kewell did at Leeds.
A change to the rules for overseas signings also means EPL clubs must now splash out to be guaranteed a work permit.
Previously, a permit would be granted for any player who’d played 75 per cent of their country’s international fixtures over three years.
Now, only a player who costs £10 million and earns £30,000 a week will be given the green light under a points system.
“It’s certainly made things harder,” Penrice said.
“It’ll be interesting to see what happens with Australia.
“Young (Daniel) Arzani has been at Celtic, but he he’s not played much due to the injury he had.
“Arzani is Manchester City’s player … they obviously think he’s got something to have signed him.
“But he needs to play games. I am guessing they’ll loan him out again.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">James dismisses Bale comparisons: Players like him are the ones you look up to</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Daniel James feels it is a "bit too much" to be compared to Wales team-mate Gareth Bale.
Winger James made an instant impact for Manchester United following his arrival from Swansea City prior to the 2019-20 season, scoring on his home debut in a 4-0 win over Chelsea.
He has since managed to add two more goals in the Premier League, as well as another for the Red Devils in the Europa League before the ongoing campaign was halted by the coronavirus pandemic.
The 22-year-old's lightning pace and willingness to run at opposing players has led some to draw similarities to Bale, yet James instead sees the Real Madrid superstar - who he describes as a "just a normal guy" - as an inspirational figure.
"I don't think you can compare me to him," James told Sky Sports.
"To play with him at Wales is obviously amazing. For anyone that doesn't know him, he's such a great guy. Just a normal guy really. He's great with the youngsters and great around the place.
"But to be compared to him is a bit too much, I think.
"What he's done in his career, how he changed from a left-back to a left midfielder, to win the Champions League... it's just amazing what he has done.
"Players like him are the ones you look up to, but I think being compared to him is a bit silly."
James has also had the chance to play alongside one of his childhood idols at club level this season, having always admired Juan Mata.
The Spaniard is not just a role model on the pitch, however, also helping the new boy settle in at Old Trafford.
"When I first met him, he came and sat next to me in the changing room and said, 'I know it's a big move for you, if you need anything here is my number and if you ever need to talk about anything I'm here.' That was obviously great for me," James revealed.
He added on Mata: "He's just someone that I've always looked up to and to play in the same team as him is just surreal for me."

    <h5 class="mb-1">'I would definitely be interested in it', says Bale on MLS</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MADRID, May 2 ― Gareth Bale has said he would be interested in playing in Major League Soccer in America if he leaves Real Madrid.
Bale has not been a regular in Zinedine Zidane's team this season and the 30-year-old almost departed last summer, before a move to Chinese club Jiangsu Suning fell through.
Any MLS club keen to sign Bale would likely have to overcome the huge financial implications of a deal. Bale's Madrid contract ends in 2022 and earns him close to 30 million euros ($33 million) a year before tax.
“I really like the league,” said Bale, speaking to the Hat-Trick podcast presented by the ICC, in an episode released on Thursday.
“I think it's grown so much over the years. When we come over and play them in pre-season, the games are difficult, the standard is getting a lot better. The clubs are improving, the facilities are improving, the stadiums are improving.
“I think it's a league that's on the up and still rising. I think a lot more players want to come over to America now and play. I would definitely be interested in it.”
Bale was also asked about the banner he celebrated with after Wales qualified for Euro 2020 in November, which caused a stir in the Spanish press.
The banner taken from the crowd read, 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order', as an indication of Bale's priorities.
“We were just joking around,” said Bale. “A few of them were saying 'if we do qualify, let's try to find it and bring it out. I was like, 'do what you want but I won't be going to get it. They found it and brought it down.
“We were all celebrating as a team and I'm not not going to not jump around with my teammates. It was a bit of banter, a bit of fun.”
Bale is keeping fit at home as the coronavirus pandemic means players are waiting to see if La Liga can resume, with the plan to restart games behind closed doors in June.
“The club are sending us two weeks of programmes every two weeks,” Bale said. “We're sticking to that, you can change it a bit if you want to do a bit more or a bit less depending on how your body is feeling. We have a guideline and we're doing the best we can to tick over for the time being.” ― AFP

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Club Brugge will ask for €25m for Emmanuel Dennis, amid interest from Wolves and their Premier League rivals.
The 22-year-old has rose to prominence this season after scoring a brace against Real Madrid in the Champions League.
That has led to a whole host of English teams being credited with an interest in Dennis. Arsenal, Everton, Leicester City and Newcastle have all been touted as potential destinations by the Belgian press in recent weeks.
Then, earlier this week, Eurosport reporter Manu Lonjon, Wolves are ‘ahead’ of  Dennis and could potentially make a move when the window opens.
According to Voerbal Belgie, the Belgian giants will look for a huge return on the €1.3m they paid for the Nigerian in 2017.
Club Brugge are believed to be hoping that the number of Premier League clubs, could spark a bidding war to drive up the price.
Last summer, the club managed to fetch around £22m for Wesley Moraes, signing for Aston Villa in a record-breaking deal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leeds tipped to challenge for Manchester United transfers including Sergio Romero</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Leeds United manager Simon Grayson believes the club will be able to attract players from Manchester United when they return to the Premier League.
Leeds have not featured in the English top-flight since their relegation in 2004 and have missed out on promotion on a number of occasions since.
Marcelo Bielsa's side are currently top of the Championship with 11 matches of the campaign remaining but saw their ambitions halted following the postponement of football back in March.
Leeds remain favourites to return to the Premier League when the season gets back under way, and Grayson believes that players like Sergio Romero could be attracted to Elland Road to play under Bielsa if they do go up.
“If Leeds get back to the Premier League, playing for the club is an exciting prospect for anybody,” he told the Daily Star.
“They’ll be attracting players from all other globe - regardless of whether they’re Argentinian or playing for Manchester United.
“Getting in front of the Elland Road faithful and working for Bielsa is a massive proposition.
“It won’t be an issue attracting players. They’ll be having recruitment meetings - Bielsa, Victor Orta and Angus Kinnear.
“There will be two lists at this moment in time. One for if they make the Premier League and one for the worst-case scenario of staying in the Championship.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul Merson explains the major advantage Man Utd have over Arsenal and Man City</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paul Merson has identified a major advantage which Manchester United hold over rivals Manchester City and Arsenal.
The Red Devils were enjoying a fine run of form which saw them close the gap on fourth-place Chelsea to just three points before the coronavirus outbreak suspended the Premier League season in March.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side looked poised to make a late surge for the Champions League places thanks to the January signing of Portugal star Bruno Fernandes and the defensive performances of newly-appointed club captain Harry Maguire.
And Sky Sports pundit Merson insists United are the team he is looking forward to watching most when football returns and claimed their "young, improving" squad is something Arsenal and City do not have.
"When football eventually restarts, the team I’m looking forward to watching more than anyone else is Manchester United," Merson wrote in his StarSport column.
"Because they were absolutely flying when we went into lockdown, winning eight of their last 11 games, scoring lots of goals and being undefeated since January.
"In fact, I’d say no-one was playing better than United before the enforced break in March.
"Can they carry on where they left off? That’s the 64 million dollar question but there are definite signs that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is starting to assemble a formidable squad at Old Trafford.
"And it’s a young, improving one, which is something that can’t really be said about the likes of Arsenal or even Manchester City."
The former Gunners forward also believes United will close the gap on league-leaders Liverpool next season despite currently trailing the Reds by 37 points.
"I’m not saying United will necessarily be title contenders next season but they are certainly heading in the right direction and they’ll be a lot closer to the top of the table than they have been in recent seasons," Merson added.
"If there is a question mark about them under Solskjaer, it is that they have a streaky side to them.
"Just as United have been capable of stringing together a few wins under Solskjaer, there’s also been a tendency to have bad runs too.
"You don’t find the likes of Pep Guardiola or Jurgen Klopp enduring slumps. The real top managers rarely go more than two or three games without a win.
"So yes, the jury is still out on Solskjaer but if I was United fan, I’d be more excited than most about what the future holds."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Four Premier League clubs want Jesse Lingard?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 27-year-old has struggled to make his mark for the Red Devils during the 2019-20 campaign, only managing two goals and two assists in 35 appearances in all competitions.
United could seemingly be ready to listen to offers for the England international ahead of next season, and according to 90min, four Premier League clubs are 'keeping tabs on the situation'.
The report claims that Newcastle, Everton and West Ham are all monitoring developments, in addition to Leicester, who were allegedly offered Lingard in January as part of a bid for James Maddison.
However, it is claimed that the attacker 'will not be forced out' of Old Trafford this summer and could yet sign a 12-month extension with the English giants until June 2022, potentially to protect his value.
Bruno Fernandes's January arrival pushed the Englishman further down the pecking order at United, and he has not managed a single goal or assist in 20 Premier League appearances this term.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In-demand Leipzig star Timo Werner must make careful choice - Rangnick</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Timo Werner should think long and hard about whether a move away from RB Leipzig might reduce his playing opportunities, according to Ralf Rangnick.
Former Leipzig head coach Rangnick, who now works for the club's owners, Red Bull as head of sport and development, would welcome Werner staying put and remaining in the Bundesliga.
But Rangnick says the Germany striker is not irreplaceable and predicted Leipzig would be able to cope should Werner decide to leave at the end of this season.
Liverpool are among the clubs who have been linked with the in-demand 24-year-old, who indicated in recent days that he would rather move abroad than join potential suitors Bayern Munich.
"I know his family and that of his girlfriend and his agent very well," Rangnick said.
"He has continued to develop, especially in terms of his strike rate, and could take another leap under [Leipzig coach] Julian Nagelsmann and his colleagues. I would be happy if he stayed."
Speaking to German newspaper Mitteldeutsche Zeitung, Rangnick added: "In my opinion, RB Leipzig are so well positioned that he can be replaced.
"Timo will carefully consider whether he has the opportunity to play as regularly as is the case here at another club."

    <h5 class="mb-1">RB Leipzig forward Timo Werner confirms desire to move abroad</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Having starred for Leipzig in Germany's top flight and the Champions League this season, Werner has been heavily linked with a future switch to Liverpool or Chelsea.
While Bayern Munich are also said to be in the mix for the attacker, Werner has suggested that he will likely sign for a foreign club when he leaves Leipzig.
Speaking to Bild, the 24-year-old said: "Bayern is a great club, we don't need to talk about it, and Hansi Flick has proven this season that he's a really good head coach.
"But if a change should ever become an issue, I would rather take a step abroad than switch to Bavaria. It's just that the challenge in another league would appeal to me a little more than a change within the Bundesliga."
Although Werner has a contract until 2023, a release clause in the region of £51m is said to be present in his existing deal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">"Bayern? I'm better going abroad"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Timo Werner made surprising comments to 'Bild' ruling out a move to Bayern Munich. He said he would prefer to go to a foreign club.
Timo Werner's future, which seemed to lie anywhere but Leipzig, could actually lie in the city in Eastern Germany. Clubs like Liverpool, who are very interested in signing him, may not be able to make new signings because of the effects of the coronavirus, so the striker has got less options.
Bayernusually snap up the best players from the rest of the German teams and are also interested in the player, but it seems like Werner is not too keen on the idea.
In a chat with 'Bild', Werner admitted that he would prefer to go to a foreign club than the German giants. "They are a great club, we don't need to talk about that. And Flick has shown that he is a very good coach. But if I were to move, I'd rather move abroad than to Bayern," the Germany international surprised told the paper.

"A challenge in a different competition would interest me more than a move to another Bundesliga club. It's also important I like and have a good relationship with the club. I choose RB Leipzig for that reason and it's something I will always have in mind," Werner continued.
Although he had already shown his class in the past, Timo Werner has shone in the 2019-20 season. When the campaign was halted, the forward had 27 goals and 12 assists, his best ever tally for a season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Werner says ‘foreign league would appeal’ more than Bayern switch in clear come-get-me plea</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Timo Werner’s rumoured move to Liverpool is on the rocks because of the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the world.
The German international was seemingly set to make Anfield his new home this summer, but everything is now uncertain.
The pandemic has disrupted football in a way that money is now almost un-quantifiable, but that hasn’t stopped Werner from doing his best to let Liverpool know he wants them.
According to German football writer Christian Falk, the Leipzig man is quoted as saying: “A challenge in a foreign league would appeal to me rather than a move to Bayern.”
Italian reporter Fabrizio Romano added to this by saying the Reds are ‘always working to get him’ because Jurgen Klopp ‘strongly wants him’.
But any move has reportedly been put on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Daily Mirror journalist Dave Maddock.
While the Premier League looks likely to resume eventually, it’s not a certainty and that means clubs can’t bank on money coming in or not going out.
Broadcasters would be seeking reimbursements, if the season is unable to be played out and this would be bad news for any club that doesn’t have tens of millions lying around.
In the case of in non-completion, the Premier League – and its shareholders – are likely to be slapped with a financial hit of close to £1billion by Sky and BT.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Almost 10 years as a Spur but Patty Mills knows NBA will be much changed when play returns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Patty Mills has had a taste of normal home life during the most abnormal of times. But he also knows when he returns to life in the NBA, things will be greatly changed.
Mills has spent the COVID-19 pandemic at home in San Antonio, Texas with his wife Alyssa and their dog, where he has been training hard albeit without a hoop to shoot on.
San Antonio is under a "stay-at-home" order and Bexar County, with a population of around two million people, had recorded 44 deaths from a little over 1307 cases as of Saturday (AEST).
"I think we [San Antonio] have done a pretty reasonable job of following the rules from the mayor and the city," Mills told The Age from San Antonio.
"You try to focus on the bright side and that is while this is a large city, it’s still feels like a small community with the way people look after one another."
The NBA season remains suspended with the league working on how it could resume, with options including moving all teams or those still in playoff-contention to Disney World in Orlando or Las Vegas to play out the season without fans in July or August.
When the NBA stopped, Mills and his 12th-placed San Antonio Spurs were four games behind the eighth-placed Memphis Grizzlies in the western conference with 19 games left in their season.
Whether time allows for the Spurs to have a chance at playing for a place in the post-season, or whether the league goes right into the play-offs, is to be decided.
But Mills understands the pandemic will change the NBA as so much of NBA life revolves around air travel, hotels, close human interaction and visiting busy public places.
"It's the road trips, the public interactions where something like this has brought us back to how much public access we do," Mills said.
"You think about how much of that we have as professional athletes have - airplanes, buses, hotels - it's going to be different. There is no question about that.
"Everyone is going to be cautious and different strategies will be put in place as everyone develops the best way to attack this thing and figure out the best way to deal with it - assuming that it will come back [in full] next year.
"This will have a major effect on how the NBA is run for a long time probably."
What will keep Mills on track regardless of how long the NBA is off court is his fourth Olympics next year, and a personal milestone as next season will be his 10th with the Spurs.
No Australian player has spent 10 campaigns playing for a single NBA team and it's rare for someone to have a long tenure with a team unless you are a superstar like a Kobe Bryant or a Tim Duncan.
Mills is proud to not only be a leader and a bridge between the Spurs team who won the 2013-2014 NBA title and the next generation of players, but also as being an Australian who has turned San Antonio into his second home.
"It is kind of amazing," Mills said. "I never would have thought I'd be a part of an organisation like this, let alone be approaching 10 years. I mean 11-12 years in the league is unheard of for someone like me so you never take it for granted.
"But you know, San Antonio is definitely a real special place for me, the family, the missus and the dog ever since we've been here."
Mills arrived at San Antonio late in the 2011-12 season desperate to prove himself and prepare for the London Olympics with then Spurs assistant coach and Boomers coach Brett Brown.
The decade since has seen Mills enrich his life and his basketball career with the club and form a bond with his teammates, coach Gregg Popovich and the whole city.
"I say this with all honesty when I step out on the floor here in San Antonio with this silver and black, it's turned into that same feeling that I get, you know, playing playing for the green and gold and playing for Australia," Mills said.
"That's unheard of in a whole lot of places. So it's definitely become a very special place for me both on and off the court."
Next season Mills will be in the last year of his four-year deal, so you could never rule out a trade or someone looking to pry Mills from the Spurs should they still be out of the play-off mix.
But Mills still feels the need to prove himself and wants to take on the challenge of leading the team back into contention.
He aims to keep showing that when the Spurs return, especially after the club helped him source extra gym equipment for his house so he can continue workouts.
"With people not being able to play basketball during this break, it will be tough but we are in the NBA for a reason and have developed a lot of muscle memory," Mills said. "So although it might be ugly for a bit but it won't take us long to hit our stride and get back to it."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Almost 10 years as a Spur but Patty Mills knows NBA will be much changed when play returns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Patty Mills has had a taste of normal home life during the most abnormal of times. But he also knows when he returns to life in the NBA, things will be greatly changed.
Mills has spent the COVID-19 pandemic at home in San Antonio, Texas with his wife Alyssa and their dog, where he has been training hard albeit without a hoop to shoot on.
San Antonio is under a "stay-at-home" order and Bexar County, with a population of around two million people, had recorded 44 deaths from a little over 1307 cases as of Saturday (AEST).
"I think we [San Antonio] have done a pretty reasonable job of following the rules from the mayor and the city," Mills told The Age from San Antonio.
"You try to focus on the bright side and that is while this is a large city, it’s still feels like a small community with the way people look after one another."
The NBA season remains suspended with the league working on how it could resume, with options including moving all teams or those still in playoff-contention to Disney World in Orlando or Las Vegas to play out the season without fans in July or August.
When the NBA stopped, Mills and his 12th-placed San Antonio Spurs were four games behind the eighth-placed Memphis Grizzlies in the western conference with 19 games left in their season.
Whether time allows for the Spurs to have a chance at playing for a place in the post-season, or whether the league goes right into the play-offs, is to be decided.
But Mills understands the pandemic will change the NBA as so much of NBA life revolves around air travel, hotels, close human interaction and visiting busy public places.
"It's the road trips, the public interactions where something like this has brought us back to how much public access we do," Mills said.
"You think about how much of that we have as professional athletes have - airplanes, buses, hotels - it's going to be different. There is no question about that.
"Everyone is going to be cautious and different strategies will be put in place as everyone develops the best way to attack this thing and figure out the best way to deal with it - assuming that it will come back [in full] next year.
"This will have a major effect on how the NBA is run for a long time probably."
What will keep Mills on track regardless of how long the NBA is off court is his fourth Olympics next year, and a personal milestone as next season will be his 10th with the Spurs.
No Australian player has spent 10 campaigns playing for a single NBA team and it's rare for someone to have a long tenure with a team unless you are a superstar like a Kobe Bryant or a Tim Duncan.
Mills is proud to not only be a leader and a bridge between the Spurs team who won the 2013-2014 NBA title and the next generation of players, but also as being an Australian who has turned San Antonio into his second home.
"It is kind of amazing," Mills said. "I never would have thought I'd be a part of an organisation like this, let alone be approaching 10 years. I mean 11-12 years in the league is unheard of for someone like me so you never take it for granted.
"But you know, San Antonio is definitely a real special place for me, the family, the missus and the dog ever since we've been here."
Mills arrived at San Antonio late in the 2011-12 season desperate to prove himself and prepare for the London Olympics with then Spurs assistant coach and Boomers coach Brett Brown.
The decade since has seen Mills enrich his life and his basketball career with the club and form a bond with his teammates, coach Gregg Popovich and the whole city.
"I say this with all honesty when I step out on the floor here in San Antonio with this silver and black, it's turned into that same feeling that I get, you know, playing playing for the green and gold and playing for Australia," Mills said.
"That's unheard of in a whole lot of places. So it's definitely become a very special place for me both on and off the court."
Next season Mills will be in the last year of his four-year deal, so you could never rule out a trade or someone looking to pry Mills from the Spurs should they still be out of the play-off mix.
But Mills still feels the need to prove himself and wants to take on the challenge of leading the team back into contention.
He aims to keep showing that when the Spurs return, especially after the club helped him source extra gym equipment for his house so he can continue workouts.
"With people not being able to play basketball during this break, it will be tough but we are in the NBA for a reason and have developed a lot of muscle memory," Mills said. "So although it might be ugly for a bit but it won't take us long to hit our stride and get back to it."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sydney Kings star Xavier Cooks opts out of NBL contract</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Boomers prospect Xavier Cooks has opted out of his NBL contract with Sydney and will look to secure a better financial deal overseas.
The 24-year-old hasn't slammed the door on returning to the Kings, but he will look for a bigger contract elsewhere in the wake of the league drastically cutting player salaries.
It follows NBL MVP Bryce Cotton's exit from Perth this week due to the league's financial difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Cooks had one season remaining on his Kings contract after signing with Sydney last November.
"I would love to return to the NBL and win a championship for Sydney to finish what we started this year," Cooks said.
"Unfortunately, due to the changes in the league, my family and I feel like it's best for me to opt out of my current contract and explore my options.
"My agent will continue to communicate with the Kings throughout the off-season in the hope that a new deal can be reached."
Cooks made his move two days before the May 4 deadline for players to opt out of contracts so they could look at opportunities outside of Australia.
Cooks, who previously played in France with SG Strasbourg, was a key cog in the Kings' run towards their first grand final appearance since 2008.
Kings coach Will Weaver said Cooks went above and beyond to recover from a knee injury suffered with the national team before last year's World Cup.
"I'm grateful to Xavier for trusting us to play a role in his development as he strives to achieve his dreams of playing at the highest level," Weaver said.

Pogba has been heavily criticised during his stint in English football following an £89million move to Old Trafford from Juventus – with many taking aim at his lack of commitment to the cause.
He hasn’t been helped by his agent Mino Raiola regularly making statements about him wanting to leave the club but former United right-back Darmian believes a lot of the criticism he’s faced has been ‘unjustified’.
During his spell at Old Trafford, which ended in 2019, the Italian defender saw nothing but full commitment from Pogba and he thinks the negativity is a result of the exorbitant price United were forced to pay to sign him.

‘Paul is my friend and I have an excellent relationship with him,’ Darmian told the Guardian.
‘First of all: we are talking about a real champion here, a great footballer, but even they can have some periods when they don’t do as well [as they would like].
‘The real “problem” with Pogba at United, I think, was the price the club paid for him and that conditioned the way people perceived him.
‘There has been a lot of unjustified criticism towards Pogba, for example that he doesn’t work hard enough, but he always gave his best, I can assure you, in every training session.
‘In my opinion his performances were good in recent years, they talk about him too negatively [in the UK].
‘Did I see Pogba unhappy or willing to leave? No, I honestly didn’t see him sad or unhappy, quite the opposite, for all the time I was in Manchester, Paul was absolutely happy with his decision to go back there. He really cares about doing well at Manchester United.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Arsenal and Arteta missed a trick in calling off Kevin Volland pursuit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Arsenal and Mikel Arteta could well be left to rue the decision to not pursue a move for German striker, Kevin Volland.
Reports on Friday emerged to suggest that Arteta called off scouting of Volland when he took over the club.
The German hotshot was apparently on the radar of the Gunners, with former manager, Unai Emery, a keen admirer of the forward.
However, Arteta’s appointment cancelled those plans. The Mirror claim that the Spanish coach insisted other areas of the squad were more important. Ultimately, no move for Volland was followed up during January.
But with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang looking certain to leave and Arsenal having little in the way of proven goalscorers, it looks like the club might have missed a trick.
Replacing Aubameyang is going to be a massive ask for the club. Last season’s joint golden boot winner has been in excellent form once again this term.
It goes without saying, then, that replacing his goals is a big ask. However, in Kevin Volland, Arsenal would have got someone who could at least have given it a good go.
Prior to sustaining an injury in February, Volland had scored nine and laid on a further eight for Leverkusen. That form is no fluke, either. Volland also registered double figures in both columns last season.
It’s clear to see, that the German star is an attacking threat. It is even clearer, then, that Arsenal might have dropped a clanger with letting him slip through their grasp.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Arsenal legend thinks ‘incredible talent’ will snub Gunners and move to Spain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to the Mirror, Arsenal legend Martin Keown has told talkSPORT that Chelsea star Willian will snub the Gunners’ interest and instead join Barcelona or Real Madrid.
The Mirror claim that the 31-year-old looks set to leave Chelsea once his contract expires this summer, with Arsenal being heavily linked with a move for the Brazilian over the last few months.
The Mirror also recently reported an interview in which Willian admitted that he would be ‘fine’ with leaving Chelsea for a ‘rival club’.
Keown believes that the winger is an ‘incredible talent’ but that he’ll snub the Gunners in favour of a move to Real Madrid or Barcelona instead.
Here’s what Keown had to say on Willian:
“I don’t see him going to Arsenal, I think he’s aiming for Barcelona or Real Madrid”
“He’s an incredible talent. Chelsea will be weaker if he goes but Frank Lampard knows what he’s doing. I’m sure he wants to keep him.”
It’s not surprising to see that interest is mounting in Willian, we expect this will only be heightened as many clubs may opt for free transfers due to the financial impact of the Coronavirus pandemic.
Willian has been a fine servant for the Blues over almost the past six-and-a-half-years, the wide man has helped the Blues win the Premier League on two occasions.
The Brazilian has also been a key part of Chelsea sides that have achieved cup success, with the ace winning the FA Cup, League Cup and the Europa League during his time in west London.
The 31-year-old has shown no signs of slowing down this season as he’s chipped in with seven goals and six assists. Willian has looked superb under former teammate and Blues legend Frank Lampard.
As per Transfermarkt, Willian has provided a total of 118 goal contributions (59 goals and 59 assists) in his 329 appearances for the Blues.
The tricky attacker certainly has the ability and experience needed to play an important role for sides like Barcelona and Real Madrid, who unlike Arsenal are consistently challenging for major honours.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Keown rates Arsenal's chances of signing 'incredible' Chelsea star Willian</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Martin Keown doubts Arsenal will sign ‘incredible talent’ Willian this summer and believes the Chelsea star will instead be looking to join Barcelona or Real Madrid.
Brazilian winger Willian, who has won two Premier League titles and the Europa League at Chelsea, is set to leave Stamford Bridge and will be available to sign on a free transfer.
Arsenal have expressed interest in signing the 31-year-old, with Gunners boss Mikel Arteta keen to bolster his squad at the Emirates.
But former Arsenal and England defender Keown cannot see Willian signing for the Gunners and believes Chelsea boss Frank Lampard will make a late intervention to try and make the Brazilian stay.
‘I don’t see him going to Arsenal,’ Keown told talkSPORT. ‘I think he’s aiming for Barcelona or Real Madrid.
‘He’s an incredible talent. Chelsea will be weaker if he goes but Frank Lampard knows what he’s doing. I’m sure he wants to keep him.’
Willian has made more than 300 appearances for Chelsea since signing from Anzhi Makhachkala in 2013 but will be out of contract in a few months time.
Speaking earlier this week, he admitted he could leave Stamford Bridge this summer and said he would be ‘fine’ joining London rivals Arsenal or Tottenham.
‘It really is a hard decision,’ said the winger. ‘I identified myself a lot at Chelsea, I have a lot of love for everyone at the club, and the fans.
‘However, it is like I said before, if I leave Chelsea with no trouble and leaving the doors open, it would be fine to move to a rival club.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Martin Keown gives verdict on Arsenal's transfer link with Chelsea star Willian</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Willian is aiming higher than Arsenal and will look to secure a move to Real Madrid or Barcelona claims former Gunner Martin Keown.
The Brazilian is set to leave Chelsea this summer with his contract winding down.
Arsenal have been linked with the winger who has spent the last seven years in London.
The Gunners are eyeing free transfers and swap deals in the summer due to the financial affects of the coronavirus.
But Keown believes Willian is an "incredible talent" and will eye a move to Spain instead of north London.
"I don’t see him going to Arsenal," Keown told talkSPORT. "I think he’s aiming for Barcelona or Real Madrid.
"He’s an incredible talent. Chelsea will be weaker if he goes but Frank Lampard knows what he’s doing. I’m sure he wants to keep him."
Barcelona have previously been interested in Willian and had bids for the player rejected by Chelsea.
Willian has started 21 times in the Premier League despite the Blues not offering him a new deal.
The 31-year-old has won the league title as well as the FA Cup and League Cup during his time at Stamford Bridge.
Willian turned his back on Tottenham at the last minute to join Chelsea in 2013.

But he admits he would have no problem joining one of the Blues' rivals when he makes his next move.
"It really is a hard decision," he said. "I identified myself a lot at Chelsea, I have a lot of love for everyone at the club, and the fans.
"However, it is like I said before, if I leave Chelsea with no trouble and leaving the doors open, it would be fine to move to a rival club."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Premier League side that now doesn't want Coutinho</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brendan Rodgers recognised that Leicester can't consider signing Philippe Coutinho because of a mere financial problem.
The future of the Brazilian Philippe Coutinho will be one of Barcelona's big issues to solve in the transfer market.
Currently on loan at Bayern, the Bavarian side will not keep him and Coutinho seemed closer to the Premier League, where he became a star, than anything else.
Since Brendan Rodgers retains a good relationship with him from his time at Liverpool, Leicester were placed as an alternative to his signing for a while.
However, the Northern Irish manager tasked himself with distancing the player from a move to them in his latest words.
"Philippe is an incredibly talented player, but financially he is out of our reach," Rodgers said in some words collected by 'TeamTalk'.
So the Brazil International has lost a possible destination in Britain. Barça will have to keep looking...

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saints sign defensive lineman Margus Hunt from the Colts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to Rotoworld, the New Orleans Saints signed defensive lineman Margus Hunt to a one-year contract on Thursday. Financial terms of the deal were not released.
Hunt is joining his third National Football League franchise. He previously played four seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals from 2013 to 2016 and then the last three seasons with the Indianapolis Colts. In 2019 with the Colts, Hunt played in all 16 games and started five contests. He had 17 tackles (14 solo tackles and three assisted tackles).
In his career, Hunt has played in 91 games and started 25 games. He has seven pass deflections, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, 7.5 sacks, 105 combined tackles (71 solo tackles and 34 assisted tackles), 23 tackles for a loss, and 20 quarterback hits.
Hunt had a forced fumble and fumble recovery in the same game and on the same play. It came when Hunt sacked Carson Wentz in a 20-16 Colts loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on September 23, 2018.
A native of Karski-Nuia, Estonia, Hunt is one of two players in the history of the NFL to originally be from Estonia. The first was tackle Michael Roos of Tallinn, Estonia, who played 148 games with the Tennessee Titans from 2005 to 2014. Roos caught one pass in his career with the Titans for -7 yards in a 34-20 Titans win over the Houston Texans on October 9, 2005. Roos in fact caught the pass in his rookie season. In 2008, Roos was selected to the Pro Bowl and was a first-team all-pro.
At 6’8″, Hunt is the fourth tallest current player in the NFL. He only trails Pittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva of Maridian, MS; Detroit Lions offensive tackle Dan Skipper of Arvada, CO; and Tampa Bay Buccaneers tackle Demar Dotson of Alexandria, LA.
An outstanding track and field competitor, Hunt became the first athlete ever to win the gold medal in men’s shot put and discus at the World Junior Track and Field Championships. He accomplished the feat in Beijing in 2006. At 32 years of age, Hunt brings versatility to the field as he can play defensive end, defensive tackle, and nose tackle.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Premier League clubs on Friday reconfirmed their commitment to finish the 2019/20 season subject to coronavirus restrictions being lifted in Britain despite fears expressed by players. The English top flight faces an eye-watering estimated loss of around £1 billion ($1.25 billion) if no more football is played due to the global pandemic. Playing the 92 remaining games behind closed doors would mitigate that loss, avoiding the need to repay hundreds of millions to broadcasters. But the Premier League faces huge logistical difficulties in its attempts to return to action, with Britain one of the countries worst-hit by COVID-19 as the number of deaths passed 27,500. The league and clubs discussed possible steps towards resuming the season at a meeting on Friday. "The league and clubs are considering the first tentative moves forward and will only return to training and playing with government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers," the Premier League said in a statement. "The clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019/20 season, maintaining integrity of the competition and welcomed the government's support." The league reportedly informed clubs that matches will have to be played at up to 10 neutral venues for the season to be completed. Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said on Thursday that the idea of not playing matches home and away was a "further imperfection" on top of games being behind closed doors. - Legal challenges - The British government is due to review a nationwide lockdown on May 7 and Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised on Thursday to provide a "roadmap" towards easing restrictions. Liverpool are on the brink of their first league title for 30 years with a 25-point lead at the top of the table. However, the Premier League is keen to avoid potential legal challenges over the awarding of much more tightly contested European places, relegation and promotion if the season cannot be completed. Paris Saint-Germain were declared Ligue 1 champions on Thursday after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced sport could not resume before September. The decision to end the season based on average points per game has angered some clubs, most notably Lyon, who have threatened legal action after missing out on a European place. Key to any restarting of matches in the Premier League is government support. Oliver Dowden, the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, struck a positive tone after a meeting with leaders of a number of sports on Friday. "We just kicked off first of many detailed meetings to plan for a safe return of elite sport behind closed doors when, and only when, it is safe to do so on the basis of expert medical advice," Dowden tweeted. However, players are questioning whether they are being rushed back into action to save the clubs money. "Obviously, the majority of players are scared but above all because they have children, babies and family, they might live with their parents," Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero told Spanish show El Chiringuito TV. "If we return I am sure everyone will be tense because the minute one person starts to feel ill, it will be 'what's going on there?'" Players would potentially face weeks away from their families, quarantined in hotels. "I am hoping that it doesn't come to that scenario," said Brighton striker Glenn Murray. "That is far-fetched, to spend eight weeks away from your family is quite a big ask." A large supply of privately sourced tests would be needed for players, coaches and backroom staff. Testing has been a thorny political issue during the pandemic in Britain, with many frontline workers unable to access tests until recently. "If football was to resume then testing will be key and an extra layer of training will be required," former Chelsea doctor Eva Carneiro told the BBC. "It only takes one case for all of this to blow up."

The league reportedly informed clubs that matches will have to be played at up to 10 neutral venues for the season to be completed.
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said on Thursday that the idea of not playing matches home and away was a “further imperfection” on top of games being behind closed doors.
Legal challenges
The British government is due to review a nationwide lockdown on May 7 and Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised on Thursday to provide a “roadmap” towards easing restrictions.
Liverpool are on the brink of their first league title for 30 years with a 25-point lead at the top of the table.
However, the Premier League is keen to avoid potential legal challenges over the awarding of much more tightly contested European places, relegation and promotion if the season cannot be completed.
Paris Saint-Germainwere declared Ligue 1 champions on Thursday after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced sport could not resume before September.
The decision to end the season based on average points per game has angered some clubs, most notably Lyon, who have threatened legal action after missing out on a European place.
Key to any restarting of matches in the Premier League is government support. Oliver Dowden, the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, struck a positive tone after a meeting with leaders of a number of sports on Friday.
“We just kicked off first of many detailed meetings to plan for a safe return of elite sport behind closed doors when, and only when, it is safe to do so on the basis of expert medical advice,” Dowden tweeted.
However, players are questioning whether they are being rushed back into action to save the clubs money.
“Obviously, the majority of players are scared but above all because they have children, babies and family, they might live with their parents,” Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero told Spanish show El Chiringuito TV.
“If we return I am sure everyone will be tense because the minute one person starts to feel ill, it will be ‘what’s going on there?'”
Players would potentially face weeks away from their families, quarantined in hotels.
“I am hoping that it doesn’t come to that scenario,” said Brighton striker Glenn Murray. “That is far-fetched, to spend eight weeks away from your family is quite a big ask.”
A large supply of privately sourced tests would be needed for players, coaches and backroom staff.
Testing has been a thorny political issue during the pandemic in Britain, with many frontline workers unable to access tests until recently.
“If football was to resume then testing will be key and an extra layer of training will be required,” former Chelsea doctor Eva Carneiro told the BBC.
“It only takes one case for all of this to blow up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League re-states commitment to finish season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Premier League clubs on Friday reconfirmed their commitment to finish the 2019/20 season subject to coronavirus restrictions being lifted in Britain despite fears expressed by players.
The English top flight faces an eye-watering estimated loss of around £1 billion ($1.25 billion) if no more football is played due to the global pandemic.
Playing the 92 remaining games behind closed doors would mitigate that loss, avoiding the need to repay hundreds of millions to broadcasters.
But the Premier League faces huge logistical difficulties in its attempts to return to action, with Britain one of the countries worst-hit by COVID-19 as the number of deaths passed 27,500.
The league and clubs discussed possible steps towards resuming the season at a meeting on Friday.
“The league and clubs are considering the first tentative moves forward and will only return to training and playing with government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers,” the Premier League said in a statement.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Corona crunch: With October 31 a loose deadline, AFL grand final venue remains uncertain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The AFL could find themselves in a race against time to guarantee the 2020 grand final is played at the MCG after declaring on Saturday they aim to complete the season by the end of October.
The MCG - which has the contract to host the grand final until 2057 - is certain to be available for the AFL until October 10 before the venue begins preparations for the ICC T20 World Cup.
The first ICC World Cup match at the MCG is scheduled for October 25 with the final to be played on November 12. There are six T20 matches scheduled at the MCG for the tournament.
Sources suggested that although the ICC is still bullish about the T20 World Cup taking place, there was still some potential for negotiation between government and sporting bodies around where a grand final might be played if the AFL season went late into October.
AFL boss Gill McLachlan said the league had set a target to finish the season by 31 October - a date that coincides with the annual contract cycle for the AFL and clubs - but nothing was locked in and the situation remained fluid.
"We think we have the flexibility with venues to go longer," McLachlan told Fox Footy.
The league owns Marvel Stadium, allowing them flexibility in determining venues for matches outside the traditional football season.
The AFL is yet to even determine a fixture for the remaining 144 games in 2020 and there remains uncertainty about when the season might start but the decisions by national cabinet on Friday have given them cautious optimism they could return to play by June.
There are 20 weeks between June 20 and October 31 but the AFL is still working on the basis the time between each club's match will be condensed thus enabling the season to be completed in a shorter time period than normal.
Other states are jockeying for position if the MCG was not available or if Victorian venues were not able to host crowds by the time finals arrived and other states could.
The Northern Territory government has already made a pitch to host AFL games in front of crowds while West Coast CEO Trevor Nisbett told ABC Grandstand he thought the AFL would look at playing the grand final in Perth if crowds could watch football at Optus Stadium.
"I would never rule it, out. This has been such an unusual year," Nisbett said.
"If we have a really clean bill of health for a long period of time well anything is possible.
"I wouldn't see why the AFL wouldn't look at it albeit they have got contractual arrangements and so forth in Melbourne I wouldn't rule out anything yet."
Perth Stadium is scheduled to host ICC T20 World Cup matches from October 24-October 30.
The AFL grand final has been played at the MCG every season since 1991.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NZ Warriors cleared for NRL return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The New Zealand Warriors have been granted approval to fly to Australia on Sunday, where they will be able to train in Tamworth despite being in 14-day isolation.
The approval represents another big hurdle being cleared in achieving the NRL’s ambition of a May 28 return.
Thanking state and federal governments, NRL chairman Peter V’landys said the Warriors would join every club in a mandatory education day on Monday to ensure players toed the line during the coronavirus pandemic.
The approval comes after Friday’s crucial move from Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, confirming borders would be open for the state’s three NRL teams to play in NSW.
It means North Queensland, Brisbane and the Gold Coast will not need to enter isolation camps in Sydney and can remain at home with their families.
The Warriors will be able to train while in lockdown in the northern NSW town.
Families of Warriors players will remain in New Zealand for now, although the league is hopeful border restrictions will eventually ease.
“As a game, we cannot thank the Warriors enough for everything they are doing,” V’landys said.
“Right from the start of this pandemic, the club and its players have put the competition first and for that, we will be forever thankful.”
The NRL’s efforts to restart suffered a setback when four players were given fines for not adhering to self-isolation measures in two separate incidents last week.
V’landys hopes Monday’s biosecurity protocol sessions will drill in what’s at stake.
“This is an excellent outcome for rugby league and another step towards the competition resuming on May 28,” V’landys said of the Warriors’ impending arrival.
“I want to thank the federal and state governments, in particular Border Force and NSW State Emergency Operation Centre, for their assistance in making the Warriors arrival a reality.
“The club will follow the strictest biosecurity protocols and, like all clubs, will participate in an education day about the protocols on Monday morning.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: NRL return on May 28 on track as NZ Warriors cleared to fly to Australia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NRL has cleared another hurdle ahead of its planned return at the end of May after the New Zealand Warriors were cleared to enter Australia.
The Warriors squad will fly into Tamworth, a regional hub to the north of Sydney, on a specially-chartered flight on Sunday to begin the mandatory 14-day quarantine period.
Matches are scheduled to begin on May 28, resuming a season which had to be stopped in March after only two rounds because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Warriors are scheduled to stay in Australia until international travel restrictions are removed, giving them the chance to resume playing games in Auckland.
"We have never wavered in our commitment to be involved in supporting the resumption of the season," Warriors CEO Cameron George said.
"We're now ready to go and couldn't be happier about the prospect of being back on the field at the end of the month.
"It has been a challenging and often frustrating time for all parties over the last few weeks with so many issues on the table but it has finally come together as of today.
"We're exceptionally grateful to both the Australian and New South Wales governments for granting us an exemption and we respect the process they've had to work through."
Restrictions placed on movement inside Australia are starting to be relaxed, with Queensland's government confirming on Friday that NRL teams would be able to cross state borders even if the broader public had not been allowed to.
The country has recorded only 93 deaths from COVID-19, among 6,700 reported cases, while New Zealand's prime minister Jacinda Ardern said earlier this week that the virus had been eliminated in her country after 1,134 cases and 20 fatalities.
The league is planning on playing 18 more rounds with games being played behind closed doors for the foreseeable future.
"This is an excellent outcome for rugby league and another step towards the competition resuming on May 28," NRL chairman Peter V'landys said in a statement.
"The club will follow the strictest biosecurity protocols and, like all clubs, will participate in an education day about the protocols on Monday morning."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warriors get official approval to fly to Australia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Warriors have finally gotten the green light from the Australian government to fly across the Tasman in time for the resumption of the NRL season.
The NRL confirmed this morning that the Warriors received approval from the Australian Border Force to travel to Tamworth in regional New South Wales, where they will see out a mandatory 14-day quarantine period.
About 50 Warriors players and staff will get on a charter flight tomorrow to be based in Tamworth, where they have also been given clearance by the federal and NSW governments to train while in quarantine.
ARL chairman Peter V'landys said the outcome was great news for the league's efforts to resume its season.
"This is an excellent outcome for rugby league and another step towards the competition resuming on May 28," V'landys told NRL.com.
"I want to thank the Federal and State Governments, in particular Border Force and NSW State Emergency Operation Centre for their assistance in making the Warriors arrival a reality.
"As a game we cannot thank the Warriors enough for everything they are doing. Right from the start of this pandemic the club and its players have put the competition first and for that we will be forever thankful."
V'landys also added that the league has settled issues around player salary in a phone hook-up with the Warriors, and that the players assured that "they will be on the plane".
Warriors chief executive Cameron George said the team was "relieved" to get over the final hurdle.
30 Apr, 2020 7:30pm3 minutes to read"As a club we're both relieved and excited that our requests have now been taken care of to our satisfaction," said George.
"We have never wavered in our commitment to be involved in supporting the resumption of the season. We're now ready to go and couldn't be happier about the prospect of being back on the field at the end of the month.
"It has been a challenging and often frustrating time for all parties over the last few weeks with so many issues on the table but it has finally come together as of today.
"We're exceptionally grateful to both the Australian and New South Wales governments for granting us an exemption and we respect the process they've had to work through.
"We're hugely appreciative of the support we've had from the NRL, especially from (chairman) Peter V'landys who has been in our corner throughout.
"We have approval for the team to train in isolation over the next two weeks in Tamworth and I know the players and staff are looking forward to being back together as a group for the first time in six weeks."
As it stands, the Warriors will be based in Australia indefinitely, but V'landys is hopeful a "trans-Tasman bubble" will allow the Kiwi club to play a portion of the season in New Zealand if travel restrictions with Australia are loosened.
The team will relocate closer to Sydney after the 14-day isolation period.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Farm hand, kids detention, dead animal recycling: AFL coaches' new reality</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Six weeks ago, Garry Hocking was carefully nurturing young Collingwood footballers. Now, he's working as a farm hand on a property in Ceres, west of Geelong, where he's extracting weeds, mowing, whipper-snipping and applying chemicals to the paddocks with the hands that so expertly caressed a football.
"It's soothed my soul a little bit, you know, replaced going into a club," said "Buddha", the ex-Geelong champion, who's been stood down from his job as coach of Collingwood's VFL team."Not [replaced] the mateship and the camaraderie sort of stuff, but it's given me something to do. Otherwise I probably would've went stir crazy I think like most assistants or coaches are probably doing. You just miss that environment."
Ryan Ferguson, a development coach at Richmond, has found grisly but necessary work at CSF Proteins in Laverton, an outfit that recycles dead animals to produce feed for livestock and pets.
Having spent six years coaxing youngsters at Tigerland, Ferguson's new days begin at 7am and stretch for 10 hours, which are filled cleaning out a dank pit with a shovel, changing the pit's filter and then "reconstructing the filter".
Like most of the 170 or so coaches at AFL clubs, Ferguson needed work when he was stood down. "It's pretty dirty work but they look after us wage-wise. It's certainly worthwhile. It just takes a bit of the stress away in terms of home loans."
Chance Bateman, a West Coast assistant coach and ex-Hawthorn premiership player who also mentors the club's Indigenous players, has been fortunate to remain a coach during the shutdown; the difference is that he's coaching in a juvenile detention centre in Banksia Hills, a Perth suburb, where his background as a notable former Indigenous footballer burnishes his credibility with the inmates, a comfortable majority of whom are Aboriginal kids.
Bateman, like Hocking, Ferguson and a large proportion of AFL assistant coaches, has little idea of whether his position will be intact when the AFL returns, since the competition - without crowds for at least the bulk of 2020 - is being downsized. "It's a little bit up in the air," said Bateman, who is working with Fremantle assistant Roger Hayden at Banksia Hills, where the incarcerated teens play highly competitive games of footy (though not now).
Hocking, whose older brother Steve runs the AFL's football operations, said he did not know if the VFL would return this season, or what role he might retain, if any, at Collingwood. "You know there's still some unknowns and a lot of questions, no answers. What'll be my involvement if it goes to hubs, not hubs, or it comes back?
"I'm really uncertain, but I know that possibly there's plenty of work here [in Ceres] to be done."
These are harsh, unforgiving times for the AFL coaching fraternity. No cohort has had suffered more stand downs than (virtually all) assistant coaches, many of whom will lose their jobs. In a further injury, coaches are blamed for the blighted spectacle; there's a widespread view that a less-coached - read less defensive - game would be better.
But the clubs care for their own, and none of the 18 AFL clubs have provided more financial sustenance to stood-down assistant coaches than Bateman's Eagles, who have tapped one of the club's main sponsors, Mineral Resources, and found work for six staffers - coaches, conditioning staff and a physio - on the company's three mining sites in the Pilbara and around Kalgoorlie. BHP, also a club sponsor, is another temporary employer of West Coast staff.
Assistant coach Jaymie Graham spent a couple of weeks at Mineral Resources' Iron Valley in the Pilbara, where he wasn't required to operate machinery or extract minerals or ore. "We were there to boost morale and do some physical training [for the miners] and try to create some good habits," said Graham, who, amid yoga sessions and providing nutritional advice, did get the opportunity to detonate dynamite.
Hocking, who is working on the property of Rob Costa, brother of Geelong's ex-president and patriarch Frank Costa, relished the chance to be outdoors, though his hamstrings have been straining with all the bending. "Because I haven't been sort bending down doing ground balls or anything, bending over for large parts of the day ... The old hammies have been screaming. It's been good."
On the opposite corner of the continent, Graham found working outdoors more challenging when the temperature reached 42 degrees. "As it got cooler, it was pretty good," said the assistant coach.
As one whose playing career spanned from the late '80s to the early 2000s, Hocking is from an era when even the best players usually had jobs, and in his case, they typically weren't glamorous ones. Famously, he rolled an ankle when working for the Geelong City Council as a garbo in 1992 when he stopped running behind the garbage truck to kick the footy with a kid.
He's installed swimming pools, done paving and landscaping, sold real estate in Geelong ("tried to") and even worked as a postie, a job he had been preparing to resume when the COVID-19 crunch came. Then, with the assistance of a player he'd coached at the Geelong Falcons, he discovered Costa needed a hand on his 100-acre patch. "I was going to get back on the pushy and deliver mail. Whatever gets a few things done and pays the bills."
The coaches can be eligible for the government's JobKeeper subsidy of $1500 per fortnight, though Hocking and Ferguson weren't completely certain on that point. "I think it looks probable," said Ferguson.
Hocking, in any case, believed there was more dignity in working than sitting on his posterior. "Buddha" had found meaning in the menial.
"There were a few people possibly embarrassed," he said of those football folk who had found 'unskilled' labour. "But it's what has to be done."

The coaches can be eligible for the government's JobKeeper subsidy of $1500 per fortnight, though Hocking and Ferguson weren't completely certain on that point. "I think it looks probable," said Ferguson.
Hocking, in any case, believed there was more dignity in working than sitting on his posterior. "Buddha" had found meaning in the menial.
"There were a few people possibly embarrassed," he said of those football folk who had found 'unskilled' labour. "But it's what has to be done."

    <h5 class="mb-1">R Ashwin hopes T20 leagues won’t dominate international cricket after pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India’s premier off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin doesn’t want a post-Covid-19 world that is more conducive for organising T20 leagues at the expense of international cricket.
The fastest Indian to 350 Test wickets, the seasoned spinner said on Saturday he forsees another “purple patch” for him in the traditional format, provided his body holds. He also outrightly rejected the four-day proposal.
“I really do hope that this (pandemic) does not transpire into something where you have more leagues and not much of international cricket because the borders are closed,” Ashwin said during a videocast with former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar on ESPNcricinfo.
With the Covid-19 pandemic yet to subside, Ashwin doesn’t see cricket resuming anytime soon.
“I think we are still some distance away. In terms of the health of world cricket I think it is going to take longer than what people might assume.
“So, that’s an imminent possibility, but I don’t know what the further future has in store.”
He calls himself a “hardened” T20 cricketer but it is the five-day format in which he has tasted maximum success. And he is far from being done in the game’s long form.
“If my body is in great space, I think Test cricket I just have another streak of great purple patch I am looking at.”
“I believe I am a hardened professional in T20 cricket, and good at what I do. Wherever I play I will be able to deliver, with the experience that I have got and the courage that I have.”
He said the ICC’s plans to trim Test cricket by a day doesn’t excite him.
“The thought of four-day cricket doesn’t really excite me. I am a spinner and if you take a day out, I dont know if it’s going to be healthy, you are taking out a very fascinating aspect of the game,” Ashwin said.
Asked about Indian cricket, he said, “The current state of Indian cricket is as healthy as it can be. Hope we can pick it up from where we had left once sport resumes.”

Asked about Indian cricket, he said, "The current state of Indian cricket is as healthy as it can be. Hope we can pick it up from where we had left once sport resumes."
Ashwin also spoke about his love for operating with the new ball and explained the mechanics involved.
"I like a new ball because of the fizz that I get on it. One of my strengths is to be able to put revs on the hard ball as it responds better to the pitch.
"But I generally like to use the arm ball in first 2 or 3 overs because when you use the arm ball, it challenges both the edges of the batsman and forces him to go across the line which is rendered risky."
The spin ace who has often been seen with the new ball across formats, added, "The others that I use are the floaters that swing, the one that pitches in and goes out or the other one that lands on the seam and gets to go the other way. So these balls become very effective.
"With a new ball I use my middle finger more than the index finger but when I bowl with an older ball, I try and get over the top.
"Sometimes, I don't use index finger to go over the top, it is behind and I still put the revs and that's when the ball actually goes the other way."
He shared his views about the need to be versatile in the T20 format, where the bowlers have little margin for error, and about finger and wrist spinners.
"In a T20 cricket, you need to call yourself a bowler. At times you should be able to bowl a bouncer or a spinner.
"Wrist spin is successful not because it is challenging both edges of the bat but because of its unpredictable nature when bowling length. And this makes wrist spin extremely relevant."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Really hope this break doesn’t lead to more leagues than international cricket, says R Ashwin</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin said he is hoping the break caused by the coronavirus pandemic doesn’t lead to more white-ball leagues than international cricket.
The fastest Indian to 350 Test wickets, Ashwin said on Saturday he expects another “purple patch” for him in the traditional format, provided his body holds up.
“I really do hope that this (pandemic) does not transpire into something where you have more leagues and not much of international cricket because the borders are closed,” Ashwin said during a videocast with former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar on ESPNcricinfo.
With the pandemic yet to subside, Ashwin doesn’t see cricket resuming anytime soon.

“If my body is in great shape, I think I am looking at another purple patch in Test cricket. I believe I am a hardened professional in T20 cricket, and good at what I do. Wherever I play I will be able to deliver, with the experience that I have got and the courage that I have.”
Ashwin said the ICC’s plans to trim Test cricket by a day doesn’t excite him. “The thought of four-day cricket doesn’t really excite me. I am a spinner and if you take a day out, I don’t know if it’s going to be healthy, you are taking out a very fascinating aspect of the game,” he said.

“I like a new ball because of the fizz that I get on it. One of my strengths is to be able to put revs on the hard ball as it responds better to the pitch. But I generally like to use the arm ball in the first two or three overs because when you use the arm ball, it challenges both the edges of the batsman and forces him to go across the line which is risky.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Tottenham Hotspur defender Trippier charged by FA over betting breach</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Tottenham Hotspur defender Kieran Trippier faces an FA misconduct charge after a breach of gambling rules, English soccer’s governing body said on Friday.
An FA statement said Trippier had been charged in relation to breaches of Rule E8(1)(a)(ii) and Rule E8(1)(b).
It did not clarify what the breach entailed but that it had occurred in July 2019, around the time Trippier joined Atletico Madrid for a reported 20 million pounds ($25 million).
Tripper, who played for Tottenham in last season’s Champions League final in Madrid, has until May 18 to provide a response.
Rule E8(1)(b) states that a participant must not provide to any person, any information relating to football which the participant has obtained by virtue of his or her position within the game and which is not publicly available at that time.
Trippier issued a statement on Twitter saying he had “fully complied” with the FA’s investigation on a voluntary basis and that he would continue to do so.
“I want to make it clear that while a professional footballer, I have at no stage placed any football-related bets or received any financial benefit from others betting.”
If found guilty Trippier could face a lengthy ban.
Former Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge is the most recent high-profile player to be punished for a breach of the FA’s gambling rules.
He was initially handed a six-week ban, four of them suspended, and fined 75,000 pounds after being found guilty of providing his brother with information on a potential move from Liverpool to Sevilla in 2018.
After the FA appealed against the decision on the grounds that it was too lenient, an independent appeal board increased the ban to four months and doubled the fine.
Sturridge’s three-year contract with Turkish club Trabzonspor was subsequently mutually terminated in March.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kieran Trippier charged by FA for allegedly breaching betting rules</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England international Kieran Trippier has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association for allegedly breaching betting rules.
The charges relate to alleged betting around Trippier's £21.7m transfer from Tottenham to Atletico Madrid in July 2019.
The FA said in a statement: "Kieran Trippier has been charged with misconduct in relation to alleged breaches of The FA's Betting Rules, specifically in relation to Rule E8(1)(a)(ii) and Rule E8(1)(b), during the period of July 2019. He has until 18 May 2020 to provide a response.
"Rule E8(1)(a): a participant shall not bet, either directly or indirectly, or instruct, permit, cause or enable any person to bet on - (i) the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in or in connection with, a football match or competition; or (ii) any other matter concerning or related to football anywhere in the world, including, for example and without limitation, the transfer of players, employment of managers, team selection or disciplinary matters.
"Rule E8(1)(b): where a participant provides to any other person any information relating to football which the participant has obtained by virtue of his or her position within the game and which is not publicly available at that time, the participant shall be in breach of this Rule where any of that information is used by that other person for, or in relation to, betting."
Trippier has until May 18 to respond to the charges.
The 29-year-old insists he has never profited from betting on football, or from others doing so on his behalf.
"I have fully complied with the FA's investigation over the past several months on a voluntary basis and will continue to do so," Trippier said.
"I want to make it clear that while a professional footballer, I have at no stage placed any football-related bets or received any financial benefit from others betting."
Daniel Sturridge was fined £75,000 and initially given a six-week ban from football, four of which were suspended, for breaching the FA's gambling regulations last year.
A Regulatory Commission investigation found that the former England international had instructed his brother, Leon, to bet on a possible move by him to La Liga side Sevilla.
That punishment was later upgraded to a four-month worldwide ban from football and a £150,000 fine after the FA appealed because they considered the initial sanctions too lenient.
Sturridge's contract with Turkish side Trabzonspor was subsequently terminated "by mutual consent".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Football: England’s Kieran Trippier charged over alleged breach of betting rules</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England international Kieran Trippier has been charged by the English Football Association over allegedly breaching betting rules in July 2019, the month he moved from Tottenham Hotspur to Atletico Madrid.
The 29-year-old was a star of England’s run to the World Cup semi-finals in 2018 and helped Spurs to the Champions League final last season before a reported £20 million ($25 million) move to Spain. Trippier has been given until May 18 to respond.
“Kieran Trippier has been charged with misconduct in relation to alleged breaches of the FA’s betting rules”, the FA said in a statement outlining their regulations.
The statement said: “A participant shall not bet, either directly or indirectly, or instruct, permit, cause or enable any person to bet on – (i) the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in or in connection with, a football match or competition; or (ii) any other matter concerning or related to football anywhere in the world, including, for example and without limitation, the transfer of players, employment of managers, team selection or disciplinary matters.”
The defender released a statement saying he would continue to fully cooperate with the investigation.
“I have fully complied with the FA’s investigation over the past several months on a voluntary basis and will continue to do so,” he said.
“I want to make it clear that while a professional footballer, I have at no stage placed any football-related bets or received any financial benefit from others betting.”
Atletico said Trippier would be exonerated.
“The player has informed us he is calm because he has done nothing wrong,” said a club source. “It seems ridiculous to him that someone would try to link him to something like this. He will collaborate with everything to clear it up as soon as possible. He is sure that in time things will become clear.”
Trippier could face a lengthy ban if found guilty. In March, former Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge was handed a worldwide four-month ban from all football-related activity for passing on inside information on potential transfer moves in January 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tennis: Many top male players support ATP-WTA merger, says Murray</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK: Andy Murray has backed Roger Federer's call to merge the men's and women's tours, saying that many top male players believe it will be a positive step for tennis.
"When you have a lot of the top male players now starting to discuss and talk about it, that's definitely very promising," the Briton, who has often voiced his support for gender equality, told CNN on Friday.
"When these discussions happen it's quite important not just to see this merger through a man's eyes and to bring more women into the decision-making positions so that everyone's voice gets heard," added the twice Wimbledon champion, who used to be coached by Amelie Mauresmo.
The vision of having one unified tour, which has been debated on and off for decades, was renewed after 20-time Grand Slam winner Federer tweeted last month: "Just wondering ... am I the only one thinking that now is the time for men's and women's tennis to be united and come together as one?"
While professional tennis is suspended across the board due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the men's ATP Tour offers more prize money during the course of the year than the WTA events.
Hence it is little wonder that the topic has divided opinion, with Rafa Nadal among many who are backing the proposal while Australian Nick Kyrgios wasted little time in rejecting the idea.
Billie Jean King has campaigned for a joint tour ever since she founded the Women's Tennis Association in 1973 - but it is only now that officials within the men's side of the sport seem to be willing to explore the possibility of a merger.
"I did have a chance to talk with Roger and... he said the reason he even thought about this is because he finally had some space and time to reflect and think about the sport," King told CNN. "We have to stay together as a sport."
Two-time Olympic gold medalist Murray said some resistance was to be expected, recalling conversations he had with fellow ATP players who were upset when the bigger tournaments started offering equal prize money.
"I spoke to some of the male players... who were unhappy because the prize money was equal and I said 'Well would you rather there was no increase at all?' And they said to me 'Yeah, actually'," said Murray.
"That's some of the mentalities that you're working with in these discussions."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Andy Murray backs move to merge ATP and WTA Tours</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andy Murray has joined calls to merge the men's and women's tours, arguing that many of the game's top players think it would be a positive move for tennis.
Talk of one unified tour, while not a new phenomenon, has resurfaced with Roger Federer also posing the question on Twitter in April and ex-British No 1 Greg Rusedski has thrown his weight behind such a move.
Now three-times Grand Slam champion Murray has waded into the debate and thinks it is a conversation worth having.
"When you have a lot of the top male players now starting to discuss and talk about it, that's definitely very promising," Murray, who has often voiced his support for gender equality, told CNN.
"When these discussions happen it's quite important not just to see this merger through a man's eyes and to bring more women into the decision-making positions so that everyone's voice gets heard," added the twice Wimbledon champion, who used to be coached by Amelie Mauresmo.
While professional tennis is suspended entirely due to the coronavirus pandemic, contentiously the men's ATP Tour offers more prize money in a year than its WTA counterpart does.
But the proposals in themselves are not without controversy, dividing opinion among some of the game's biggest stars.
Rafael Nadal, for example, is also among many who are backing the proposal while Australian Nick Kyrgios wasted little time in rejecting the idea.
Billie Jean King, meanwhile, has campaigned for a joint tour ever since she founded the Women's Tennis Association in 1973, but now officials within the men's side of the sport appear to be willing to explore the possibility of a merger.
"I did have a chance to talk with Roger and he said the reason he even thought about this is because he finally had some space and time to reflect and think about the sport," King said. "We have to stay together as a sport."
Two-time Olympic gold medallist Murray admitted that some resistance was to be expected, recounting conversations he had with fellow ATP players who were upset when the bigger tournaments started offering equal prize money.
"I spoke to some of the male players... who were unhappy because the prize money was equal and I said 'well would you rather there was no increase at all?' And they said to me 'Yeah, actually,'" Murray said.
"That's some of the mentalities that you're working with in these discussions."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Andy Murray encouraged by ATP-WTA merger discussions</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andy Murray believes there is strong support among leading players on the ATP Tour for a merger with the WTA.
Roger Federer tweeted his backing for a unified tennis tour last month, amid the coronavirus-enforced halt to major sporting action.
Rafael Nadal immediately backed the Swiss star and Murray, another supporter of the idea, is encouraged by the discussion, though he insists female players must also be heard.
"When you have a lot of the top male players now starting to discuss and talk about it, that's definitely very promising," the two-time Wimbledon winner said to CNN.
"When these discussions happen it's quite important not just to see this merger through a man's eyes and to bring more women into the decision-making positions so that everyone's voice gets heard."
Murray, who was previously coached by Amelie Mauresmo, has long been an advocate for the women's game, but explained challenges remain in changing the views of some.
"I spoke to some of the male players... who were unhappy because the prize money was equal," he said.
"I said, 'Well would you rather there was no increase at all?' And they said to me, 'Yeah, actually.'
"That's some of the mentalities that you're working with in these discussions."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">1. Raven’s Rabbit started her career in the US and what she did first-up for her new yard last preparation when second to Pauper at Moruya would win this. Inclined to forgive subsequent failure.

12. The Deepest Secret never got a crack at her rivals at Goulburn last week. Convinced she’d have fought out the finish with any luck. That was off a year break. Not conventional to see her seven days later but she had every right to be bright after never being asked to extend.Dangers: 4. Farage also presents here on the week turnaround after blowing his chances at the start at Canberra. His two runs prior to that see him in the finish again here. 1. Endymion will look the winner at some stage but is just failing to put one away.How to play it: The Deepest Secret to win.Odds and Evens: Evens.
6. Globalise was unsuited back in trip last start at Moruya having won so impressively this track and trip the start prior. Blaike McDougall does the steering here and will have the four-year-old parked in the first couple.Dangers: 8. Shrug ran in that same Moruya race and there was a struck match between her and Globalise. She isn’t far away from another win. 3. Freaky Freckles is on trial at this trip but is hard fit and her recent form behind Cyborg and Airfree reads exceptionally well.How to play it: Globalise.Odds and Evens: Evens.
6. Rubaiya has no excuses having found the perfect race third-up out to the mile from a middle draw. She was excellent first up before running third behind River Charge and Shelby Sixtysix, with both franking the form since. Should be winning.Dangers: 2. Belleistic Lad and 10. Silver Nook are unlikely to turn the tables on Rubaiya from laststart but both are building towards something and are suited out to the mile.

If 1. Major Danger is anywhere near ready after eight months on the sidelines he is the horse to beat. Down to 58.5kg after the claim sees him in just 3.5kg above the minimum. Very appealing for a Highway winner three starts ago.Dangers: 3. Bitofastar has tackled this track and trip twice for a win and a fast finishing second. Watch for him late. Similar case for 15.

4. Direct Default is holding his form well at the moment and will punch up from the inside draw to be handier than we saw at Goulburn last start.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dale ready to pull a rabbit out of his hat at Sapphire Coast</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Raven’s Rabbit, a five-year-old mare who started her career running around on dirt tracks in the United States, looks well placed at the Sapphire Coast on Sunday to knock off her maiden.
The lightly-raced chestnut had her first start for astute trainer Matthew Dale back in October last year and after showing plenty of early zip, she was collared late by handy gelding Pauper. That race has provided five subsequent maiden winners.
Raven’s Rabbit was subsequently disappointing as a heavily-supported favourite at Wagga when fading to finish at the rear having led again. We’ll forgive her that blemish.
Dale has found a very winnable task for his flier today, the opening race on the card, a 908m maiden that lacks depth. He takes two runners to the spacious country track and looks set to walk away with two winners with Rubaiya equally well placed in the Club Bega Maiden Handicap (1608m).
This Rubick filly has returned a different horse this preparation having shown very little in her first three starts but excellent runs this time back have her ready to win.
First-up she cleared out from the rest of her rivals to run a narrow second behind Boom And Zoom before finding the line well at Moruya to run third despite not getting the clearest passage. River Charge won that race and has subsequently run second to Cyborg in the Wagga Guineas prelude before running third in the Wagga Guineas behind Foxborough. In second was Shelby Sixtysix and he has comfortably won two races since.
Rubaiya is third-up out to the mile from a perfect draw, so there are no excuses for her today. She should be winning this race.
Meanwhile, sometimes there is more to a horse’s form than meets the eye and expect that to be the case with Direct Default ahead of his 1408m assignment later on Sunday. He has failed in all four previous tries at the trip but they were all in the space of seven starts much earlier in his career when he was out of sorts.

Dale has found a very winnable task for his flier today, the opening race on the card, a 908m maiden that lacks depth. He takes two runners to the spacious country track and looks set to walk away with two winners with Rubaiya equally well placed in the Club Bega Maiden Handicap (1608m).
This Rubick filly has returned a different horse this preparation having shown very little in her first three starts but excellent runs this time back have her ready to win.
First-up she cleared out from the rest of her rivals to run a narrow second behind Boom And Zoom before finding the line well at Moruya to run third despite not getting the clearest passage. River Charge won that race and has subsequently run second to Cyborg in the Wagga Guineas prelude before running third in the Wagga Guineas behind Foxborough. In second was Shelby Sixtysix and he has comfortably won two races since.
Rubaiya is third-up out to the mile from a perfect draw, so there are no excuses for her today. She should be winning this race.
Meanwhile, sometimes there is more to a horse’s form than meets the eye and expect that to be the case with Direct Default ahead of his 1408m assignment later on Sunday. He has failed in all four previous tries at the trip but they were all in the space of seven starts much earlier in his career when he was out of sorts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul Pogba's ex-teammate lifts lid on star's influence in Man Utd dressing room</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Matteo Darmian has leapt to the defence of former teammate Paul Pogba by claiming that the France midfielder is unfairly criticised even though he "really cares about doing well at Manchester United ".
Pogba has endured an underwhelming season at Old Trafford thanks to ongoing ankle problems and he has failed to find the back of the net in any of his eight appearances in all competitions.
However, the World Cup winner has returned to fitness and is likely to stay with the Red Devils for at least another year after having a change of heart about a summer transfer to Real Madrid.
And Pogba's attitude to return to full fitness and fight to be part of United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's plans comes as no surprise to Darmian.
The Italy international told The Guardian : "Did I see Pogba unhappy or willing to leave? No, I honestly didn't see him sad or unhappy, quite the opposite, for all the time I was in Manchester, Paul was absolutely happy with his decision to go back there.
"He really cares about doing well at Manchester United."
Darmian spent three years training alongside Pogba before moving to Serie A club Parma last summer. He believes the former Juventus man will bounce back to show the form that made United pay £89.3m for him in 2016.
“Paul is my friend and I have an excellent relationship with him," Darmian added. "First of all: we are talking about a real champion here, a great footballer, but even they can have some periods when they don’t do as well [as they would like].
"The real 'problem' with Pogba at United, I think, was the price the club paid for him and that conditioned the way people perceived him.
"There has been a lot of unjustified criticism towards Pogba, for example that he doesn't work hard enough, but he always gave his best, I can assure you, in every training session.
"In my opinion his performances were good in recent years, they talk about him too negatively [in the UK]."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jesse Lingard wanted by 'four Premier League clubs'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jesse Lingard is reportedly a target for four Premier League clubs amid doubts over his Manchester United future.
The academy product has shown flashes of class at Old Trafford but consistency has been a huge problem for the 27-year-old and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is understood to be losing patience with him.
Lingard didn't register a goal or assist in the whole of the current campaign before it was stalled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The arrival of Bruno Ferndes has also pushed him down in the pecking order while United have been linked with a big money move for Lingard's England teammate Jadon Sancho.
According to 90min, Newcastle, West Ham, Everton and Leicester have all registered an interest in snapping up the Englishman.
United are still contemplating whether to trigger a clause in his contract that will extend it by another season.
Lingard's current deal expires in 2021 and his value is dropping, meaning an extension would seem likely from a financial point of view.
As mentioned, the Red Devils have plans on signing another midfielder in the transfer window.
Ajax star Donny van de Beek is the latest to be linked, who could come in to replace Paul Pogba.
And Leicester ace James Maddison has been courted as well.
But Aston Villa star Jack Grealish is the hot favourite to move to Old Trafford this summer.
Dean Smith's side face relegation this year after just one season in the top tier and they may not be able to keep hold of their most prized asset and captain.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United morning headlines as Marcus Rashford sends academy message</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Adams: Arsenal ambition stopped my United move
Tony Adams has revealed he rejected Manchester United due to Arsenal's ambition.
Adams won a plethora of trophies in North London but was approached by Sir Alex Ferguson, with the two clubs dominating English football for the best part of the decade.
“Sir Alex Ferguson came in for me,” Adams told Sky Sports. “But I wouldn't leave and I said to the chairman: 'Have we got ambition at the club?'
"He said 'don't worry, we are injecting a lot of money and we are going to go for it'.
"I stayed and the rest is history - Dennis [Bergkamp] came and Nicolas Anelka, [Patrick] Vieira, Manu [Emmanuel Petit], Robert Pires - we had five World Cup winners in the team.”
But Adams went on to say that things have changed: "It is a completely different club today. I think recruitment at Arsenal for a good few years has not been great.
"Now we seem to be selling our best players and you are never going to recruit a championship squad selling all your best players."
Evra received debut apology
Patrice Evra says his debut for Manchester United was such a disaster his agent apologised to him for arranging the transfer.
Evra joined United from Monaco for £5.5million in January 2006 and was thrown in at the deep end in the same month against Manchester City at Eastlands. City took a 2-0 half-time lead and Evra was replaced by Alan Smith at the interval.
City ran out 3-1 winners and Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off in United's third defeat in four at City, and Evra's struggles in his first months at the club cost the Frenchman a World Cup squad place in the summer.
Evra lined up against Liverpool the following week for Rio Ferdinand's added time winner following a deflating debut, and the more vivid memory is of his introduction to the Manchester derby.
"‘What the hell am I doing here?" Evra told the United podcast. "I was in Monte Carlo, chilling. Here the football is so fast. 'Oh my God, you’re so done Patrice. You should go back to Monte Carlo’. I remember thinking that and the worst part is when the game was finished.
"We go back to my flat with my agent and his wife, and my agent looked at me like this and said, ‘Patrice, I’m sorry’. I was like, ‘why?’
"‘I’m sorry to bring you here. You’ll never make it, it’s too hard, you should stay in Monte Carlo’. In front of his wife!
"That day I was so bad, so embarrassing. My agent actually told me I should have never gone to Manchester United. So yeah, I have this tough moment, but it helped me to become who I am."
Rashford’s message to academy stars
Marcus Rashford has delivered a message to young players after the academy season was cancelled.
The Premier League confirmed that all academy football up to under-23 level has been curtailed due to the coronavirus crisis to give clubs and players clarity at this uncertain time. United's under-23's were second in the Premier League 2 Division 2 before the season was cancelled, three points behind leaders West Ham with a game in hand.
Rashford wrote on Twitter: "The news you got yesterday was probably not what you wanted to hear. I know all you want to do is play because I'm the same, but the decision has been made to protect everyone involved. This is bigger than football.
"You might be feeling a bit low but the best thing you can do is pick up your ball and get out in the garden. When I was in the academy I used to find a spot in the garden and aim for targets just so I could practice my accuracy, get creative!
"Now is not the time to fall out of love with the game, it's a time to remember why you fell in love with it in the first place.
"You've got this and we can't wait to see you all back next season!"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tony Adams wouldn't sell Aubameyang for "any price"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Arsenal legend Tony Adams has hit out at the club's policy of selling their best players and fears they're set to lose Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang this summer.
The Gabon striker is out of contract in 2021 and is being linked with a move away from the Emirates, with Inter Milan and Barcelona both reportedly interested in the 29-year-old.
Adams says he wouldn't sell the former Borussia Dortmund attacker at "any price" but fears the Gunners are about to lose another big name:
"Quite possibly, he could walk out the door", the double winning skipper told Sky Sports News.
"I loved Arsene Wenger's principles, that no player was bigger than the club, and he moved players on if it made sense for the club financially.
"He was strong with that and he got Champions League football every year but it did stand in the way of recruitment - so we have become a club that is selling the best players.
"If I was a coach I'd be saying 'don't sell Aubameyang at any price, we need to recruit, bring players through the academy and keep our best players'.
"I think recruitment at Arsenal for a good few years has not been great.
"Now we seem to be selling our best players and you are never going to recruit a championship squad selling all your best players."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United fans have hammered Paul Ince after he warned Jadon Sancho about moving to the club this summer.
United are interested in a move for Borussia Dortmund winger Sancho at the end of the season with the youngster perfectly fulfilling the club's transfer strategy.
However, former midfielder Ince warned the England international that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer does not have a good track record of improving players.
Although it is true Solskjaer does not have the vast managerial experience of other managers, many United fans feel the criticism is unwarranted.
Taking to social media supporters hammered Ince for his comments and replied with players they feel have improved under the Norwegian manager.
He's wrong
Still bitter?
Hasn't got a clue
Doesn't make sense
Was good enough for Haaland
Two more examples
Fair to say

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Its happening' - Aston Villa fans have this transfer theory after Jack Grealish update</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jack Grealish has got Aston Villa fans talking – and not for the first time during the Premier League suspension.
The Villa skipper has been the shining light for Dean Smith’s side this season, emerging as one of the best midfielders in the top-flight this season.
His performances have attracted the likes of Man City, Spurs, Everton and Manchester United, the latter placing him at the top of their transfer wishlist.
But that hasn’t stopped him trying to improve his boyhood team, according to fans on social media anyway.
Grealish was asked about Sevilla striker Wissam Ben Yedder during an Instagram Q & A, replying: “Can’t believe how much he scores past me on Ultimate Team [Fifa].”
Ben Yedder, who was linked with Villa in the summer then shot back at Grealish, saying: “Still lucky it’s not IRL tho @JackGrealish.”
And with the two linking up on social media, it has led to Villa fans dreaming of them doing it in the claret and blue next season:
@GymIad: Ben yedder to villa confirmed
@lukewoodyy: agent jack
@DougIasLuiz: It’s happening. Ben Yedder to Villa
@The Asgardian: Bring him to B6, King.
@Joe_1874: Agent grealish
@DomPhillipsCSGO: Go on Agent Jack secure the bag
@DanRenshawAVFC: Yedder to the Villa
@NealCaffreyCI: Bring him to Villa
@LongClaw9: Ben Yedder and Grealish, dream team up top, for next seasons push for Champions League
@SimonStewart: I bet he's already at Bodymoor!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jadon Sancho responds to Trent Alexander-Arnold over Liverpool transfer plea</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jadon Sancho has given Liverpool fans plenty to get excited about after responding to transfer comments made by Trent Alexander-Arnold.
The Reds right-back was doing an Instagram Live with Michael Dapaah in which he was asked about the prospect of Sancho heading to Anfield.
Alexander-Arnold was of course in favour of a move having played with the Borussia Dortmund star with England.
"If he came to us, he’d make our team better," Alexander-Arnold told Dapaah. "So I’d be more than happy for him to come. I played with him for England and he’s a special, special, special, special talent."
Sancho was tuning in to the video and responded with series of eye emojis which suggest he may be open to the move.
Liverpool have always been linked with the 20-year-old and that will only intensify after the player's comments.
Rivals Manchester United and Chelsea are also in the frame with the former having a long standing interest in the forward.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to recruit young, homegrown talent and Sancho perfectly fits the bill.

His rapid rise since moving to Germany has seen his value soar to around £100m.
Dortmund chiefs have reiterated their desire to keep Sancho, who has a contract with the Bundesliga club until 2022.
The current coronavirus pandemic has tested the finances of football clubs meaning transfer spending may be affected.
And United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has told fans that mega-money deals could be beyond them this summer.
He said: "Nobody should be under any illusions about the scale of challenge facing everyone in football and it may not be ‘business as usual’ for any clubs, including ourselves, in the transfer market this summer."
"As ever our priority is the success of team, but we need visibility of the impact across the whole industry, including timings of the transfer window, and the wider financial picture, before we can talk about a return to normality."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga says it is unthinkable that Harry Kane will leave the Premier League club.
Kane faces an uncertain future in north London after insisting he won't stay at Spurs "for the sake of it".
The north London side are apparently 'furious' and 'exasperated' with the striker, leading to suggestions that they could sanction a world-record £200 million move to Manchester United.
When asked about Kane's future, Gazzaniga told ESPN: "I don’t know the situation of Harry, at the moment he is here.
"We are happy with him, of course. He's a player who always gives us goals and points.
"He is always very important for us.
"We are only thinking of him as a Tottenham player. We're not thinking of him being at another team."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hugh's beauty lands five winners as Bowman warms up chilly Randwick</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There was a time a few years ago when the social media scorn thought there were two Hugh Bowmans: one for carnival time and one for non-carnival time.
The theory went when your money was on while he was riding under the bright lights it was game on. Outside of that, when Winx was in the paddock or pre-training or trotting laps of Rosehill or trialling and Bowman was riding slower horses at a slow time of year, you were never quite sure what you would get.
The sentiment was highly unfair, but it managed to get oxygen from behind a keyboard.
This year, the coronavirus-crippled autumn carnival has been and gone. The weather is cooling down and the jockeys who do it tough weight wise - not many do it tougher than Bowman - feel the most heat when they get out of bed in the morning and can't feel their toes. The scales don't budge as easily.
Bowman is only a few weeks removed from riding all three legs of the two-year-old triple crown, including his first Golden Slipper. If he was flat you could hardly blame him.
Yet as the wind blew through a frozen Randwick on Saturday, there was little in the way of change.
Bowman rode a five-timer on the Kensington track for five different stables: Winx's handler Chris Waller, Team Hawkes, John O'Shea, the partnership of Peter and Paul Snowden and James Cummings' Godolphin juggernaut.
It could have been six if not for Glen Boss crashing the party on Wild About Her in the last, just edging out the Bowman-ridden Juventus. Boss turned around shortly after they passed the post and quipped: "how does it feel to run second?"
Asked about his affinity with Randwick's inner circuit, a modest Bowman joked: "I couldn't stand the joint before today. There's no magic about what I'm doing, I've just had the right horses with conditions to suit."
After one last-stride winner he mentioned the Melbourne Cup in the same breath as a benchmark 78 winner, Waller's Yonkers.
The horse was bought by bloodstock guru Guy Mulcaster out of the United States, raced initially in Europe before ending up in Australia. On face value, the horse's story seems as strange as Bowman's prediction after he took every inch of the straight to nab Gone Bye over 1800 metres.
But Bowman knows what's ahead, a spring carnival with little chance of international visitors and it's not fanciful to think Yonkers will make the cups grade should 2020 be an antipodean-only year.
"I'm not saying he’s a Melbourne Cup horse, but he’s certainly going to be up to the better staying races in the spring," Bowman shrugged.
He then sat motionless on the Hawkes' Dirty Work, who won with the same authority of Winx at her pomp. O'Shea's Rocha Clock came from last and rounded up her rivals. Betting drifter Hightail had the blinkers on and showed the same laser-like focus of his rider, stalking main danger Hilo and sprinting clear. And then a race later he arrived late to win on Phaistos, who he ironically gunned down by a nostril riding stablemate Ranier last start.
It was a riding masterclass. The only disappointment was the fact there was almost no one there to watch it in person.
Rachel King nabbed an early riding double of her own when she saluted aboard Ciaron Maher and David Eustace's Macroura in the first before John Thompson's sharp filly Fituese trounced her rivals.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United great Gary Neville recalls moment he knew Cristiano Ronaldo was special</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gary Neville believes Cristiano Ronaldo was too "erratic" in the early stages of his Manchester United career but hailed the way he became one of the best in the world.
Ronaldo moved to Old Trafford in the summer of 2003 for just over £12m from Sporting Lisbon.
And although he went on to become one of the greatest players in world football, the winger initially found life tough going in England.
So much so that Neville has recalled how he once vented his frustration about the now 35-year-old to the club's strength and conditioning coach, Mike Clegg, because he couldn’t cope with his unpredictability.
But now reflecting on Ronaldo’s rise to become one of the best in world football, Neville admits it was an incredible watch.
" Sir Alex Ferguson and Carlos Queiroz, I think it’s important to put Carlos Queiroz in the category with Sir Alex, they were both champions of him, they both believed in him,” he told The Football Show on Sky Sports.
"I think that he came back from the World Cup that summer. It was like everything had changed. His maturity and his decision-making, which was a big thing, his experience, his physical attributes had completely changed overnight.
"He went from someone who, if you look at his early pictures at Manchester United, he was scrawny, really thin, wiry, didn’t look very strong.
"All of a sudden, I think it was after that 2006 World Cup, he came back like a super-middleweight boxer. His body had just completely transformed, he was absolutely incredible.
"From a strength point of view and a plyometric point of view, the ability to leap, the ability to score with his head, the ability to change direction, everything seems to fall into place. It was just a maturity, physically, mentally, everything happened to him.
"It was brilliant to watch, there was a point I remember going into the gym after one training session and speaking to Mike Clegg [ United’s strength and conditioning coach] who worked very hard with Cristiano physically in the gym and saying to him, ‘I don’t know what he’s going to do next’.
"You didn’t know where he was going to be defensively, you didn’t know when he was going to release the ball, players in the middle of the box didn’t know when he was going to cross it. It was just erratic.
"But they had great faith in him, Sir Alex Ferguso n and Carlos Queiroz, and they believed in him, put him forward in front of players who had greater reputations at the time and he developed into something brilliant."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gary Neville admits he moaned about Cristiano Ronaldo in his early days at Old Trafford because he was too "erratic"
The Portuguese star moved to Manchester United in the summer of 2003 for just over £12m from Sporting Lisbon.
But Neville recalls letting off steam to the club's strength and conditioning coach, Mike Clegg, because he struggled to deal with Ronaldo's unpredictability.
He accused the now 35-year-old of struggling to fit into a defensive structure and not delivering when he should've.
Ronaldo went on to become a world star at United following the World Cup in 2006 with Sir Alex Ferguson and Carlos Queiroz earning praise for persevering with him.
And Neville admits it was an incredible transformation to watch.
He told Sky Sports: "Sir Alex Ferguson and Carlos Queiroz, I think it’s important to put Carlos Queiroz in the category with Sir Alex, they were both champions of him, they both believed in him.
"I think that he came back from the World Cup that summer it was like everything had changed. His maturity and his decision-making, which was a big thing, his experience, his physical attributes had completely changed overnight.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lionel Messi is not a natural goalscorer, former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Lionel Messi has been praised for his hard work by former Spurs boss Tim Sherwood
- The 51-year-old believes Messi’s abilities were all down to his work rate
- More outrageously, Sherwood claimed Messi was not a natural goalscorer after recording 627 goals in 718 career appearances
Lionel Messi's rivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo is one that will not go away easily even after both stars have retired from the game.
The superstars have been on top of their games in over 15 years - winning individual as well as collective accolades with their respective clubs.
One thing which fans always seem to agree on in the debate is the clear distinction in the players' success stories.
Many argue that the two are virtually impossible to compare and contrast because of the simple fact that they have quite different styles of play.

In fact, fans argue that Messi is more of a natural talent while Ronaldo is a work machine who toiled to become the powerhouse fans know and love today.
However, former Tottenham Hotspur manager Tim Sherwood does not buy that narrative, saying: “there is no such thing as natural talent.”
Sherwood told Daily Mail that Messi’s success was all down to hard work, as is the case with many successful people around the world.
More outrageously, the former Aston Villa boss went on to suggest Messi’s goal-scoring prowess was also not natural and he had to learn majority of his skills like everybody else.
“I don’t but that there are natural goalscorers. Lionel Messi is what he is because he’s dribbed stone round an alleyway and his brothers have been taunting him for years,” Sherwood analysed.

According to the former England international, having an elite mentality was far more important than the so-called natural talent and he insisted Messi and Ronaldo had plenty of that.
“I would take attitude over ability all day. If you can marry the two up, then you have a serious footballer,” he went on.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Premier League football legend, Gary Neville, has said that he doesn't see Ronaldo retiring from the game of football until he has surpassed Pele's goalscoring record because he wants to be termed the best footballer of all time.Gary Neville and Ronaldo were team-mates at Manchester United and the ex-Manchester United defender says Ronaldo's obsession with perfection might see him play until his 40s. Pele scored a total of 1281 goals in 1363 games, a Guiness Book record, while Ronaldo has scored over 700 goals prompting Neville to say surpassing Pele is Ronaldo’s main target."He just wanted to be the very, very best in the world and it's so important to him,” Neville told SkySports."It's an obsession. Absolute obsession with scoring goals. Applying himself every single day, being the fittest he can possibly be. I think he's lifted his professionalism every single year and progressed."Jamie (Carragher) mentioned before about James Milner wanting to play into his late 30s and 40s. I think he [Ronaldo] has a plan to go on and take over Pele's record. "I genuinely believe he wants to go on and beat Pele's numbers."That's where I think he's at in his mind, he wants to be the greatest of all time, that is his sole purpose, understanding that along the way if he is the greatest of all time, the teams that he plays for will win trophies and be successful."

    <h5 class="mb-1">On this day: Born May 3, 1942: Vera Caslavska, Czech gymnast</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - When Vera Caslavska bowed her head and turned away in protest at the Soviet anthem during the 1968 Olympics, the Czech gymnast cemented her place as not only one of the country’s greatest athletes but also as a powerful voice against Communist rule.
Two months after Warsaw Pact tanks swept into Czechoslovakia to crush the “Prague Spring” reforms, the anti-Soviet icon dazzled at the Mexico Games, claiming four golds and becoming one of only two women to win successive titles in the all-around competition.
Yet it was her silent moment of defiance as the anthem played during the medal ceremony for the floor exercise, when she controversially shared a joint gold with a Soviet athlete after the judges upgraded the preliminary scores of her rival, that endeared her to Czechs.
It also made her a beloved figure long after her sporting career had ended.
“We Olympians were the only ones who could demonstrate our attitude to the Soviet occupation to the world at that time of occupation,” Caslavska said in a 2007 interview with iDNES.cz.
All together, Caslavska took seven golds in her two Olympic Games, including back-to-back wins in the vault. She also won the beam at Tokyo 1964 and the uneven bars in 1968.
Caslavska, who began her sporting career as a figure skater, was also the first and only gymnast to win an all-around title at an Olympic Games before winning it at the World Championships, European Championships and ensuing Olympics.
Her main rival in Tokyo, Ukrainian-born Larisa Latynina, was the only other female gymnast to win successive golds in the all-round competition, in 1956 and 1960.
“She was a phenomenal sportswoman,” Latynina told Reuters after Caslavska died in 2016 from pancreatic cancer. “Vera and I were friends and we would give each other presents. We would also swap vinyl records.”
Czech authorities, however, nearly stopped Caslavska’s journey to Mexico City in its tracks after she publicly opposed Soviet rule by signing a dissident manifesto in the spring of 1968.
Forced to hide in the mountains to avoid arrest, the gymnast only gained permission to compete at the last minute.
During her time in hiding, she lifted potato sacks to keep fit and substituted logs for beams to prepare for the games where her dominant performances and decision to use the Mexican Hat Dance as music for one of her routines won the adoration of the local fans.
Caslavska topped off her remarkable Olympics by marrying Czech 1,500 metres champion Josef Odlozil in Mexico City, 24 hours after her competition ended, in an event that drew thousands of well wishers.
Yet her triumph abroad did not translate into a warm welcome at home.
Caslavska was expelled from the Czech sports union and ostracised for criticising the 1968 invasion and refusing to withdraw her signature from the Prague Spring protest movement’s “Manifesto of 2000 Words.”
From 1974 she trained other gymnasts at home and also during a spell in Mexico. Czechs later voted her as the nation’s second-greatest athlete after runner Emil Zatopek.
When Communist rule ended in Czechoslovakia in 1989, President Vaclav Havel appointed her his adviser for sport and social issues. She also led the Czech Olympic Committee from 1990 to 1996.
Her personal life following the country’s “Velvet Revolution” that ended authoritarian rule in 1989 was not easy.
In 1993 her then ex-husband Odlozil died from injuries suffered in a fall after he was struck by their son Martin during a dispute.
In later years, Caslavska fell into a deep depression but overcame the illness and returned to public life, coaching gymnasts and serving as a mentor to younger Olympians.
She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015 and died the following summer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19: Australia bans use of saliva as sports activities set to return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australia banned saliva and sweat to shine the cricket ball as the federal government released guidelines for the gradual return of professional and recreational sport in the coronavirus pandemic, cricket website ESPNCricinfo reported.
Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) made the guidelines with the help of medical experts, sporting bodies, and federal and state governments.
Cricket Australia's chief medical officer John Orchard was also involved in the preparation of the framework.
Under the AIS framework, restrictions on sport are currently outlined as being at "Level A" restricting all training except that of the individual kind.
But soon there will be a shift to "Level B" and it will allow net sessions in which batters will be able to face bowlers. However, bowlers will be limited for the session. Level B will also allow for unrestricted fielding sessions.
Under Level B, warm-up drills involving unnecessary person to person contact has not been allowed. Ball shining with sweat/saliva has also been not allowed under training, ESPNCricinfo reported.
The third and final "Level C", will be permitted later in the year and it is outlined as: "Full training and competition. No ball shining with sweat/saliva in training."Shining the ball is a major thing for bowlers in trying to extract some swing from the match. As the game starts swaying in favour of batsmen by each passing day, bowlers have to try everything they can in trying to trouble the batsmen.
Earlier this year, even India pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar was skeptical of using saliva on the ball ahead of the ODI series against South Africa.
"We are taking every precaution we can. We have a team of doctors with us, who are advising us on dos and don'ts. We have a meeting with our doctors. If they advise us to not use saliva on the ball, then we will follow it. So, it all depends upon the instructions given by the doctor," Bhuveshwar Kumar had said during a press conference earlier this year.
Right now, no sport is being played as all top tournaments like IPL, Premier League, LA Liga have been suspended and there is no certain answer as to when all these competitions will resume.
Wimbledon 2020 has been cancelled for the first time since World War II and Tokyo Olympics have been postponed for the first time.
The World Health Organisation had termed coronavirus as a 'pandemic' on March 11.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cricket Australia to work with government to prepare biosecurity plan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MELBOURNE: In Australia, the use of saliva or sweat to shine the ball will be restricted once cricket training returns in the post coronavirus world. The federal government in Australia has released a framework regarding the staged return of sports amid the pandemic under the title "The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) Framework for rebooting sport in a COVID-19 environment" available on the official government website.
AIS, in consultation with medical experts, sporting bodies and federal and state governments, has come up with guidelines wherein they have restricted the use of saliva and sweat to shine the ball.
The framework, which outlines a staged return to play, has three stages -- Level A, Level B and Level C. Currently, sports is outlined as being at "Level A", which restricts all training except that of the individual kind. "Running/aerobic training (solo), resistance training (solo), skills training (solo)."
However, in probably a week's time, it will move to "Level B" which will allow the following: "Nets -- batters facing bowlers. Limit bowlers per net. Fielding sessions -- unrestricted. No warm up drills involving unnecessary person-person contact. No shining cricket ball with sweat/saliva during training."

The third and final "Level C", to be permitted later in the year, is outlined as: "Full training and competition. No ball shining with sweat/saliva in training."
Meanwhile, Cricket Australia also welcomed Prime Minister Scott Morrison's announcement regarding national principles for the recommencement of community and professional sport, as agreed by the national cabinet.
"As and when restrictions are lifted, CA will seek advice from medical experts including our own Chief Medical Officer, John Orchard, and relevant government agencies to support the cricket community with protocols and guidelines that allow community cricket to recommence as early and as safely as possible," CA said in a statement.
"Cricket Australia will continue to work with government to prepare a comprehensive biosecurity plan to ensure we are as prepared as possible to deliver elite cricket content on Australian soil, including an exciting summer of cricket highlighted by the ICC T20 World Cup 2020 and the Border-Gavaskar Test series between Australia and India," it added.
In the framework, there are also guidelines for training and management of illness in elite sports.
"Individuals should not return to sport if in the last 14 days they have been unwell or had contact with a known or suspected case of COVID-19.
"Athletes returning to sport after COVID-19 infection require special consideration prior to resumption of high intensity physical activity.
"Resumption of sporting activity may not be linear. Increasing restrictions may be required in response to fluctuating numbers of COVID-19 cases."
The government has said that the AIS framework is a "timely tool" for 'how' reintroduction of sport activity will occur in a cautious and methodical manner, to optimise athlete and community safety.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saliva, sweat ball shining restricted in Australia as per government guidelines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After the reports of ICC contemplating legalised ball-tampering so as to discourage players to shine the ball with sweat or saliva, Australian federal government, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, banned shining the ball with saliva or sweat as the government prepare for the staged return of both professional and recreational sport amid the coronavirus pandemic.
ESPN Cricinfo reported that the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) have drawn up guidelines after consulting medical experts, sporting bodies and federal and state governments. Cricket Australia's chief medical officer John Orchard was involved in the preparation of the framework as well. 
Although NRL is supposed to get the first preference, it is also reported that Cricket might actually make a fast return, for essentially it is a non-contact sport. The Australian cricket team's next scheduled matches in Australia is a limited-overs series against Zimbabwe in August and if the stage clears, it might actually become the first sporting event to happen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Artists, athletes cling to their dreams on Havana's rooftops</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HAVANA: These are hot, humid days in Havana. When the afternoon breeze sweeps in off the sea, William Roblejo steps onto the roof of his building, draws his bow across the strings of his violin, and runs through his repertoire of music to soothe an anxious city.
Access to a rooftop and a breeze is a coveted luxury in the Cuban capital, areas of which have been in lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic for several weeks.
On other Havana rooftops, the country's top ballet dancer rolls out a mat and runs through his positions and pirouettes, an Olympic pentathlete lunges at an imaginary rival with an epee, and a Greco-Roman wrestling champion pumps iron.

Cuba has imposed lockdowns only in certain barrios, but the government has called on people to stay home as the number of confirmed infections climbed above 1,500 this week with 64 deaths.
With temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius, water shortages in some areas of the capital and long lines at food stores, Cubans have grown more anxious under weeks of confinement.
Adrian Sanchez, first soloist at the National Ballet of Cuba, fears above all that his muscles and his posture, used to a daily nine-hour training regime, will atrophy.
"When all this is over we have to return to the ballet, and if we come back untrained, that will be very hard," said Sanchez, 22.
He practices "two or three hours" a day on the roof of his building, reached through a skylight and overlooking the iconic Revolution Square.
"That way the time goes by faster, and I don't feel I'm being locked up so long," he says.
Like everyone else, a good part of his day is spent queuing up for food.
After decades of living under a US blockade, Cubans are adept at making do, even under the most difficult of circumstances -- not least their athletes and performers who now have to find a way to pursue their dreams during the uncertainty fuelled by the pandemic.
Leydi Moya pulls out her epee to practice her fencing as part of her preparations for the next Olympic pentathlon event, whenever that may be.
Moya, youth Olympic champion in Singapore 2020 and triple-medallist at the Pan-American Games in Lima last year, was returning from a training camp in Mexico when the pandemic hit the region.
She knows that the makeshift training regimen she is reduced to at home is a far cry from Olympic-standard fitness training.
"Performance is going to drop," she admits.
It's a similar situation for Daniel Gregorich, a Pan-American champion in Greco-Roman wrestling at his 87 kg weight level, who made Cuba's Olympic team at a recent qualifying event in Ottawa, Canada.
"Sport is health, sport is life and at least it calms my anxiety," the 23-year-old said between sessions of lifting weights and doing push-ups.
Roblejo, the musician, is at times frustrated by not having his usual concert audience because "musicians are used to delivering art live."
But he is also grateful for some of the quarantine's gifts as he plays on his rooftop above the deserted barrio of Playa, where the lulling sounds of the sea are more noticeable now there is no traffic.
"I have to thank this quarantine a little bit, because I studied a bit more and I think I've advanced in my music. Now I want this to be over so that I can show it," said Rob Lejo, head of the string section of Havana's Conservatory.
In many ways, he admits to being "very happy. I've been locked up and playing alone at home for 20 or 25 days now."
Psychologist Patricia Ares, writing in Granma, the daily of the ruling Communist Party, said "all of us will have to learn to live with adversity.
"We cannot avoid the wind, but we can build windmills."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was on May 2, 2010, when Suresh Raina became the first Indian to score a century in T20 international match. The left-handed batsman achieved the feat against South Africa in the 2010 T20 World Cup.
In the match between India and South Africa, the latter won the toss and opted to bowl first. Raina came to the crease in the very first over of the innings as India lost its first wicket in Murali Vijay.
The southpaw then went on to play a quickfire knock of 101 runs off just 60 balls. Raina's innings was studded with nine fours and five sixes. Playing second fiddle to Raina, Yuvraj Singh scored 37 off 30 balls with three fours and two sixes. The duo's 88-run stand in the middle put India in a comfortable position.

After India posted a total of 186/5 in the allotted twenty overs, the Men in Blue successful defended the total and won the match by 14 runs. For India, Yusuf Pathan scalped two wickets while defending the score of 186.
However, the Men in Blue failed to make it to the semi-finals of the tournament.
To date, Rohit Sharma has scored four T20I centuries, while KL Rahul has two to his name in the shortest format of the game.
Raina has enjoyed a great career in the shortest format of the game and he is the second-highest run-getter in the Indian Premier League. The left-handed batsman has played 193 matches for Chennai Super Kings and has managed to score 5,368 runs in the tournament so far.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Today in 2010, Suresh Raina became the first Indian to score a T20I century</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: It was on May 2, 2010, when Suresh Raina became the first Indian to score a century in the shortest format of the game. The left-handed batsman achieved the feat against South Africa at Gros Islet in St Lucia during the ICC World T20.
South Africa won the toss and opted to bowl first. Raina came to the crease in the very first over of the innings as India lost opener Murali Vijay. Raina then went on to play a quickfire knock of 101 runs off just 60 balls.
Raina's innings was studded with nine fours and five sixes.

Yuvraj Singh (37 off 30) played second fiddle to Raina and the duo stitched an 88-run partnership for the third wicket to put India in a comfortable position.
India posted 186/5 in the allotted twenty overs and then successfully defended the total by restricting the Proteas to 172/5 to win the match by 14 runs. Yusuf Pathan scalped two wickets, while Ashish Nehra and Piyush Chawla took one apiece.
However, India failed to make it to the semifinals of the tournament.
To date, Rohit Sharma has scored four T20I centuries, while KL Rahul has two to his name in the shortest format of the game.
Raina has enjoyed a great career in the shortest format of the game and is the second-highest run-getter in the Indian Premier League.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Watch: Suresh Raina’s 101 against South Africa in 2010, the first ton by an Indian in T20I cricket</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A total of three Indian batsmen have hit centuries in T20 International cricket. While Rohit Sharma has four to his name and KL Rahul has two, the first Indian to get a ton in a T20I was Suresh Raina.
The southpaw played a knock for the ages against South Africa during the 2010 World T20 in West Indies. Raina scored 101 runs off just 60 balls in that match, with nine fours and five sixes, and helped India register a 14-run win.
When in form, Raina could strike the ball as cleanly as any batsman. During that innings, he showcased his full array of strokes and used his wonderful bat-swing to devastating effect.
Raina has an impressive record in the shortest format, be it in international cricket or in the Indian Premier League. The left-hander has 1,605 runs to his name from 78 T20Is, with an average of 29.18 and a strike-rate of 134.87. He is the second-highest run-scorer in the IPL, having scored 5,368 runs from 193 matches.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Suresh Raina recalls when he became first Indian, third in world to score a T20I century</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Recalling his achievement on this day in 2010, Suresh Raina said scoring the first-ever T20I century for India was “one of the most memorable moments” in his career.
On May 2, 2010, Raina had cracked a breezy 60-ball 101 against South Africa in a World Cup match. Raina’s blistering knock, which helped India pile up an intimidating 186 for five, had nine fours and five sixes. India had won the match by 14 runs.
This had then been the first T20I ton by an Indian and the third overall. Chris Gayle and Brendon McCullum had been the two others who had scored centuries before Raina.
Taking to Twitter 10 years after the feat, Raina wrote: “One of the most memorable moments for me. Scoring a first ever T20i century for my country undoubtedly filled me with a lot of confidence, energy a never ending zest of giving my 100% to my game every time I’m on the field.”
Speaking after the match, Raina had said in 2010, “If you play 40 to 50 balls and you can score 80 to 85 runs. I had batted well in the IPL and knew that number three is a crucial position and if you bat well, sure you can get a hundred.”
Hundreds in the T20 format are rare for batsmen, with only two Indians having replicated Raina’s feat in international T20s since then. Rohit Sharma has four centuries in T20Is and KL Rahul has two.
Incidentally, Raina had also scored his first 100 in the IPL on May 2 in 2013.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLINL Three people have tested positive for coronavirus at Cologne and will be placed into a 14-day quarantine, the Bundesliga club said Friday (May 2) in a potential blow to hopes of restarting the German football season this month.
"Cologne had the entire team and coaching staff, along with the backroom staff, tested on Thursday for COVID-19. Three people tested positive, all are symptom free," the club said in a statement on its website.
"After an assessment of the cases by the responsible health authorities, the three people who tested positive will go into a 14-day quarantine at home.
"Cologne will not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those affected."
The club said it would continue to train in preparation for the campaign to resume, with further tests to be carried out as part of the league's health and safety protocol.
"We now see in everyday life that our concept recognises and reduces risks at an early stage," said Tim Meyer, head of the German league's medical task force.
"We are convinced that with our concept, we can enable players to practice their profession with the best possible protection against infection."
The Bundesliga had set a target return date of May 9 but still needs permission from the German government.
A delay on the decision this week meant a resumption would not be possible before May 16.
A final decision is expected next Wednesday.
The German league confirmed Thursday that clubs had started testing players for the virus as part of plans to get the season up and running again.
It has been suspended since Mar 13.
Clubs returned to training at the start of April while adhering to social distancing guidelines and games would be played behind closed doors, with large-scale public events banned in Germany until August 31.
Borussia Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke warned last weekend that "the entire Bundesliga will go down" unless the league restarts.
Germany's top clubs are desperate for the season to be completed by June 30 in order to claim an instalment of television money worth 300 million euros ($325 million).
A return in May would make the Bundesliga the first top league in Europe to resume as Germany cautiously eases lockdown measures.
Nevertheless, there is heated debate about whether the Bundesliga should resume amid the pandemic which has so far claimed the lives of more than 6,000 people in Germany.
Paris Saint-Germain were declared Ligue 1 champions on Thursday after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced sport could not resume in France before September.

Meanwhile, English Premier League clubs on Friday reconfirmed their commitment to finish the season subject to coronavirus restrictions being lifted.There are still 92 games remaining. They will be behind closed doors with neutral venues suggested.
Italy's 20 Serie A clubs on Friday also reiterated their unanimous desire to complete the season despite sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora this week saying the chances of restarting were "increasingly narrow".
In Spain, La Liga is planning to start testing players for the coronavirus between Tuesday and Thursday next week, after which they would then be able to resume individual training programmes within 48 hours.
"I hope that we can start playing in June. We have until June 28," league president Javier Tebas said.

Borussia Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke warned last weekend that “the entire Bundesliga will go down” unless the league restarts.
Germany’s top clubs are desperate for the season to be completed by June 30 in order to claim an instalment of television money worth 300 million euros ($325 million).
A return in May would make the Bundesliga the first top league in Europe to resume as Germany cautiously eases lockdown measures.
Nevertheless, there is heated debate about whether the Bundesliga should resume amid the pandemic which has so far claimed the lives of more than 6,000 people in Germany.
Paris Saint-Germain were declared Ligue 1 champions on Thursday after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced sport could not resume in France before September.
Meanwhile, English Premier League clubs on Friday reconfirmed their commitment to finish the season subject to coronavirus restrictions being lifted.
There are still 92 games remaining. They will be behind closed doors with neutral venues suggested.
Italy’s 20 Serie A clubs on Friday also reiterated their unanimous desire to complete the season despite sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora this week saying the chances of restarting were “increasingly narrow”.
In Spain, La Liga is planning to start testing players for the coronavirus between Tuesday and Thursday next week, after which they would then be able to resume individual training programmes within 48 hours.
“I hope that we can start playing in June. We have until June 28,” league president Javier Tebas said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus latest: Three people test positive at Bundesliga club Koln</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The German top flight looks set to become the first major league to return to action as the world continues to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.
Clubs are back in training with a mid-May resumption on the cards, but Cologne's arrangements have received a setback.
The club, 10th in the Bundesliga, said that "after three positive tests, three people at FC Koln are now in quarantine" – but also that "the group training can continue".
In a statement, Cologne said: "FC Koln had the entire team and coaching staff, along with the backroom staff, tested on Thursday for Covid-19. Three people tested positive, all are symptom free.
"After an assessment of the cases by the responsible health authorities, the three people who tested positive will go into a 14-day quarantine at home. FC Koln will not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those affected.
"FC Koln's training can continue as planned, according to the hygiene and infection control measures that have been in place since April 6 in group training.
"The prerequisite for this is that the relevant group of people are tested further, as stated for in the medical concept of the 'Taskforce Sports Medicine/Special Game Operation' from the DFL."
The procedure discussed on Friday with the taskforce's chair Professor Dr Tim Meyer, medical director of the Institute for Sports and Preventive Medicine at Saarland University, and Professor Dr Barbara Gartner, specialist in microbiology and infection epidemiology.
Meyer said: "We now see in everyday life that our concept recognises and reduces risks at an early stage.
"We will always be in close contact with the responsible health authorities and medical experts.
"We are convinced that with our concept, we can enable players to practice their profession with the best possible protection against infection."
Cologne managing director Horst Heldt: "The health and private sphere of players and staff have priority above all else.
"The previous measures, as well as the strategy of regular tests, have proven themselves so that we can now react with individual solutions."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bundesliga restart blow as three test positive for coronavirus at Cologne</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Three people have tested positive for coronavirus at Cologne and will be placed into a 14-day quarantine, the Bundesliga club said Friday in a potential blow to hopes of restarting the German football season this month.
"Cologne had the entire team and coaching staff, along with the backroom staff, tested on Thursday for COVID-19. Three people tested positive, all are symptom free," the club said in a statement on its website.
"After an assessment of the cases by the responsible health authorities, the three people who tested positive will go into a 14-day quarantine at home.Â 
"Cologne will not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those affected."
The club said it would continue to train in preparation for the campaign to resume, with further tests to be carried out as part of the league's health and safety protocol.Â 
"We now see in everyday life that our concept recognises and reduces risks at an early stage," said Tim Meyer, head of the German league's medical task force.
"We are convinced that with our concept, we can enable players to practice their profession with the best possible protection against infection."
The Bundesliga had set a target return date of May 9 but still needs permission from the German government.Â 
A delay on the decision this week meant a resumption would not be possible before May 16.Â 
A final decision is expected next Wednesday.
The German league confirmed Thursday that clubs had started testing players for the virus as part of plans to get the season up and running again.Â 
It has been suspended since March 13.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thierry Henry notes positive changes in his return to MLS</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There’s been a shift in Major League Soccer in the relatively short time since Thierry Henry was a player. The former Arsenal star, now the new coach of the Montreal Impact, played for the New York Red Bulls from 2010 to 2014.
Back then, Henry said, MLS was still targeting players from Europe at the end of their careers. Like him. But now the league is drawing promising young talent from Mexico and South America signalling a progression from the old `retirement league’ reputation MLS once had. The average age of players is skewing younger than a decade ago.
That’s a sign that the league is evolving, Henry said.
Henry noted that MLS is retaining young talent, like LAFC’s Carlos Vela, who in the past may have gone to Europe.
“I don’t know how far the league can go. It’s up to us obviously, now I’m back in, to make sure that we can elevate the league as much as we can,” he said.
This league has no limits for me, but you need time to reach that level.
MLS was celebrating its 25th season, and Henry was embarking on his first as coach of the Impact, when play was suspended on March 12 because of the coronavirus outbreak.
On Friday, however, the league took its first step toward restarting the season by announcing it was allowing voluntary individual workouts for players at team outdoor practice fields starting next Wednesday.
Montreal had started well, with a win in Henry’s debut as coach over the New England Revolution, and a draw on the road against FC Dallas, before the league was shuttered.
Henry, who signed a two-year contract with the Impact last November, is now navigating the uncertainties of coaching amid a pandemic.
Well, what’s difficult is not being on the field, as I mentioned before. You cannot beat that. You need to be on the field in order to have a feeling, to have intensity,” he said.
“And when you succeed at what you wanted to do or planned to do for a game or a training session, the players are buying it a bit more because they can feel it a bit better.”
It is Henry’s second stint as a head coach: He had a difficult three-month tenure coaching Monaco, the club he played for as a youth. Before that, he coached the forwards for Belgium, which reached the 2018 World Cup semifinals.
As a player, Henry is France’s all-time top scorer and a winner of the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship. He retired from international play in 2010 with 51 goals in 123 appearances.
With Arsenal, Henry held the record for most goals for a foreign player in the English Premier League (175) until Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero passed him in January.
Henry remains Arsenal’s all-time leading scorer with 228 goals across all competitions during his time there from 1999-2007.
Henry also played for Barcelona before signing with the Red Bulls, where he scored 51 goals before retiring in 2014 and becoming a TV soccer commentator.
Henry is hopeful he’ll get to restart the latest chapter of his career soon.
I always mention Jurgen Klopp. It took him three and a half years to do what he’s doing with Liverpool. It doesn’t happen just like that, Henry said.
So we were kind of getting somewhere. It was early stages let’s not get carried away. Guys were starting to understand what we wanted and how we wanted to play and the intensity and the togetherness and the fight that we wanted to put into games.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">A judge threw out the USWNT's equal pay lawsuit against US Soccer — here's why</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US women’s national team’s fight for equal pay has suffered a huge blow.
In a shocking decision announced Friday evening, the judge presiding over the team’s highly-publicized lawsuit against the US Soccer Federation dismissed the players’ claims of unequal pay – and the $66 million in damages they sought along with it.
US District Judge R. Gary Klausner granted in part US Soccer’s motion for a summary judgment, arguing that the women’s claims that the men’s national team’s greater earning potential was a breach of the Equal Pay Act were unfounded.
The USWNT’s unequal compensation claim was rooted in the fact that the men’s team’s players are eligible to make far more money than the women’s team’s players ever could. The team’s lawyers argued that the $66 million in damages the players asked for is commensurate with the amount they would have earned had they been given the rate “set forth in the USMNT collective bargaining agreement.” Essentially, the women argued that if the men had achieved the exact level of success the women have, the men would have earned an additional $66 million compared to what they actually earned.
But whether or not it’s unfair – or a violation of the law – is a different question. One Klausner determined due to the varying structures of the USWNT’s and USMNT’s CBA.
The baseline difference between the national teams’ CBAs is that the USWNT players’ pay is much more concentrated in fixed salaries – $100,000 per player – and provides more guaranteed contracts in total. The men’s team’s compensation is much more heavily based on incentives.
For that reason, the men are eligible for larger bonuses. Since the USMNT is also eligible to play more games than the women do, their total earnings potential far exceeds that of the USWNT. In practice, the men have neither qualified for as many tournaments nor won nearly as many games as the women have, so the USWNT has actually outearned the USMNT in recent years.
And while the US Soccer Federation used the women’s greater total earnings as one argument to justify the dismissal of their claim, Klausner was further persuaded by the fact that the men and women negotiate their CBAs independently, and thus both parties independently agreed to the compensation structures they currently have.
“The history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players,” Klausner wrote in his 32-page decision, per the AP.
“Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT’s pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure,” he added.
The decision comes as a shock, especially after US Soccer faced intense public scrutiny for its previous defense that unequal pay for the USWNT is fair because “men are bigger, stronger, faster.” The argument, which the federation has since rescinded, eventually forced the ouster of former USSF President Carlos Cordeiro.
But according to former Sports Illustrated soccer writer Grant Wahl, even those most familiar with the case were not expecting to see a summary judgment reached on either side. Most anticipated that the entire case would make its way to trial or get settled before the specified court date.
Another, smaller aspect of the USWNT’s complaint is still in play despite the national team’s huge setback Friday evening. In addition to their chief grievance of unequal pay, the women also claimed to have received inferior travel accommodations and medical support services compared to their male counterparts. Klausner will still hear arguments on the topic in a trial set for June 16 in Los Angeles.

    <h5 class="mb-1">On This Day in 2010: Rory McIlroy wins first PGA Tour title</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy won his first PGA Tour title at the Quail Hollow Championship in Charlotte on May 2, 2010.
Here, the PA news agency looks back at his maiden title in America.
McIlory had only been playing on the PGA tour for six weeks and had started 2010 playing on the European Tour, earning two top-10 finishes, but he could not convert his form in America as he missed the cut at the Houston Open and the Masters. They came ahead of what became the biggest win of his early career as McIlroy, a professional for just three years, proved the doubters wrong.
Despite what was to come, McIlroy was on the verge of missing his third cut in a row on the Friday afternoon. He was two shots over the cut line with three holes to play before an imperious approach from 206 yards allowed him to convert an eagle putt. “Most important shot of the year, to be honest,” McIlroy said at the time. “If I don’t make eagle there, I’m practising at Ponte Vedra this weekend. I said after the 66 yesterday: ‘That could have been the turning point in my season.’ I think today I’ve confirmed that.”
McIlroy’s opening rounds of 72 and 73 had him nine shots behind leader Billy Mayfair after 36 holes before he began to find form. He struck the lowest round on the Saturday, a 66, to set the tone on what would be an exceptional Sunday. “The last two days, it seemed as if everything had just gone right,” he said after winning. “You get yourself into sort of a mindset like that, and you just keep going.”
McIlroy started the final round four behind leader Mayfair and ended the day 10 ahead of the American. He began with three pars before a birdie at the par-four fourth and stormed through the field, racing back to the clubhouse in just 30 – sinking a 43-foot putt on the 18th to seal victory in a course-record 62. The Northern Irishman secured a four-stroke victory over Phil Mickelson as, two weeks before his 21st birthday, he became the youngest winner on the PGA Tour since Tiger Woods won in Las Vegas in 1996 aged 20 years and 10 months.
McIlroy has since won the 2011 US Open, the PGA Championship in 2012 and 2014 and the 2014 Open. The Masters has eluded him, with his best finish coming in 2015 when he placed fourth. He has also helped Europe win four Ryder Cups while picking up the FedEx Cup and two Race to Dubai titles and is currently ranked number one in the world.

    <h5 class="mb-1">On this day: Rory McIlroy wins first PGA Tour title</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Here, the PA news agency looks back at his maiden title in America.
McIlory had only been playing on the PGA tour for six weeks and had started 2010 playing on the European Tour, earning two top-10 finishes, but he could not convert his form in America as he missed the cut at the Houston Open and the Masters. They came ahead of what became the biggest win of his early career as McIlroy, a professional for just three years, proved the doubters wrong.
Despite what was to come, McIlroy was on the verge of missing his third cut in a row on the Friday afternoon. He was two shots over the cut line with three holes to play before an imperious approach from 206 yards allowed him to convert an eagle putt. "Most important shot of the year, to be honest," McIlroy said at the time. "If I don't make eagle there, I'm practising at Ponte Vedra this weekend. I said after the 66 yesterday: 'That could have been the turning point in my season.' I think today I've confirmed that."
McIlroy's opening rounds of 72 and 73 had him nine shots behind leader Billy Mayfair after 36 holes before he began to find form. He struck the lowest round on the Saturday, a 66, to set the tone on what would be an exceptional Sunday. "The last two days, it seemed as if everything had just gone right," he said after winning. "You get yourself into sort of a mindset like that, and you just keep going."
McIlroy started the final round four behind leader Mayfair and ended the day 10 ahead of the American. He began with three pars before a birdie at the par-four fourth and stormed through the field, racing back to the clubhouse in just 30 – sinking a 43-foot putt on the 18th to seal victory in a course-record 62. The Northern Irishman secured a four-stroke victory over Phil Mickelson as, two weeks before his 21st birthday, he became the youngest winner on the PGA Tour since Tiger Woods won in Las Vegas in 1996 aged 20 years and 10 months.
McIlroy has since won the 2011 US Open, the PGA Championship in 2012 and 2014 and the 2014 Open. The Masters has eluded him, with his best finish coming in 2015 when he placed fourth. He has also helped Europe win four Ryder Cups while picking up the FedEx Cup and two Race to Dubai titles and is currently ranked number one in the world.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Time Out: On this day in 2010 Rory McIlroy wins first PGA tour title</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rory McIlroy won his first PGA Tour title at the Quail Hollow Championship in Charlotte on May 2, 2010.
Here, we look back at his maiden title in America....
The new boy
McIlory had only been playing on the PGA tour for six weeks and had started 2010 playing on the European Tour, earning two top-10 finishes, but he could not convert his form in America as he missed the cut at the Houston Open and the Masters. They came ahead of what became the biggest win of his early career as McIlroy, a professional for just three years, proved the doubters wrong.
Almost missing the cut
Despite what was to come, McIlroy was on the verge of missing his third cut in a row on the Friday afternoon. He was two shots over the cut line with three holes to play before an imperious approach from 206 yards allowed him to convert an eagle putt. "Most important shot of the year, to be honest," McIlroy said at the time. "If I don't make eagle there, I'm practising at Ponte Vedra this weekend. I said after the 66 yesterday: 'That could have been the turning point in my season.' I think today I've confirmed that."
Making up ground
McIlroy's opening rounds of 72 and 73 had him nine shots behind leader Billy Mayfair after 36 holes before he began to find form. He struck the lowest round on the Saturday, a 66, to set the tone on what would be an exceptional Sunday. "The last two days, it seemed as if everything had just gone right," he said after winning. "You get yourself into sort of a mindset like that, and you just keep going."
The final round
McIlroy started the final round four behind leader Mayfair and ended the day 10 ahead of the American. He began with three pars before a birdie at the par-four fourth and stormed through the field, racing back to the clubhouse in just 30 - sinking a 43-foot putt on the 18th to seal victory in a course-record 62. The Northern Irishman secured a four-stroke victory over Phil Mickelson as, two weeks before his 21st birthday, he became the youngest winner on the PGA Tour since Tiger Woods won in Las Vegas in 1996 aged 20 years and 10 months.
Legacy
McIlroy has since won the 2011 US Open, the PGA Championship in 2012 and 2014 and the 2014 Open. The Masters has eluded him, with his best finish coming in 2015 when he placed fourth. He has also helped Europe win four Ryder Cups while picking up the FedEx Cup and two Race to Dubai titles and is currently ranked number one in the world.
